[title]Charlotte Alter: If Warren drops out[selftext]https://twitter.com/CharlotteAlter/status/1235246862287777792[comment]&gt;Put another way: despite their ideological similarities
&gt;And the way many high-profile Warren supporters have been treated by the Bernie base doesn't help.

&gt;Anecdotally-- I'm hearing from Warren voters saying they now plan to vote for Biden[comment]Frankly she should just endorse Biden at this point. It would do a lot to help unify the party and clear the lane for Biden[comment]Looking at this another way: If 50% of Warren supporters would vote for Sanders[comment]This fits me really well.   It is almost my exact reasoning.
[comment]God y‚Äôall are so intolerable. If you have your way Trump will be re-elected.
[comment]As a Bernie supporter
My wife is disabled and I work 54 hours a week so I don't think I'm your average Bernie supporter. I feel like running around and yelling at people but that's not how you win people over. I'm just so frustrated with everything.

I will 100% back whoever the Dem nominee is[comment]We're being held hostage by scared children that want to go back to pretending nothing's more concerning that the next episode of Jersey Shore.
[comment]"*sometimes* aggressive base"

Lol!üòÑ
[comment]It still makes me laugh how disillusioned Bernie supporters are on social media. They assume they're always being cheated and bully the supporters of other candidates but get super upset when you stand up to them. Alter is 100% right[comment]As a Yang supporter I got *extremely* negative vibes from Bernie Bros. I still voted for Bernie[comment]Warren's voters are HER voters.  They are not Bernie's by default.  She is not "stealing" his votes.  She has earned *hers*. 

Isn't that what Bernie supporters have said for the last 4 years? You have to "EARN" my vote?

So Bernie and his sycophants
If a person is still supporting Warren[comment]I don‚Äôt worry about Warren voters voting blue in November
Warren should be getting praise today for single handedly ending Bloomberg‚Äôs undemocratic run[comment]I voted for Warren in our primary. I‚Äôm a white college educated liberal who thinks she would make a terrific executive even if she isn‚Äôt the best campaigner. 

If I had to choose between Bernie and Biden...I‚Äôd probably choose Biden. I agree with Bernie‚Äôs values but I‚Äôm deeply skeptical about his ability to be an effective executive. 

Biden
I‚Äôll be out knocking doors for the winner either way.
[comment]I condemn a lot of the worst behaviour from Bernie supporters but people need to understand that Bernie represents the some of the most disenfranchised and marginalized people in American society. He polls strongest with young people of every race[comment]Bracing for the misogynistic backlash against Warren if she doesn‚Äôt fully endorse Sanders in *3[comment]I totally understand the Warren fan sentiment
I have posted over on some Bernie subs (I'm a Bernie supporter: surprise!) that Warren's base doesn't owe us a damn thing
Bernie definitely has some immature people making loud noises and doing obnoxious
For the record I do not believe that Biden has a snowballs chance in hell in beating Trump[comment]Imagine being so clueless that you think how someone delivers their message or deals with others is irrelevant in politics. Then imagine also believing you should  run an entire political party.
[comment]Warren voters will not vote for Sanders according to my Twitter feed.
[comment]Dude what ever. Nah sayers. Have some hope.
[comment]I can't bring myself to support either Biden or Bernie. Or any man. I want Warren. She is best prepared to deal with the dumpster fire Trump will leave us. She has proven her understanding of good government. 
If Trump survives to campaignI will not canvassNo more white men. Sorry.
[comment]But Biden would be more likely to keep Trump in power than Bernie...
[comment]They will if she drops out and endorses Bernie
[comment]well i like bernie and warren both .. but if the democratic elite (corporate )

try to screw bernie or warren then i am voting for trump .. to heck with the dems .... they have fought for corps to many times and now biden is trying to get in
[comment]I would suspect most of her supporters would back Bernie if she endorses Bernie and starts campaigning for him because if he wins
People need to get tougher skin if a few internet trolls bother them that much.
[comment]Biden is Republican lite. Warren railed against him and his ilk and said she would support most of the same policies as Bernie. I cannot fathom  her or her followers supporting Biden over Bernie.
[comment]Sounds like the corporatist talking point of the day.

If they want Trump gone maybe Bidens gaffes and being on both sides of so many issues is worse
[comment]"It would be great if people didn't die when they have no health insurance

I came across a man lying in the middle of the street one morning and I realized he was having a heart attack. I ran to get help

How do these people sleep knowing the death count for their inaction is in the thousands.
[comment]I'm picking the ideologically opposite candidate because some random people were mean to me on the interwebz.

It's funny
It's not like Bernie is calling for the burning of churches here. Its literally infuriating that people can actually blow such dumb nonsense out of proportion.

But it serves us right
And now comes Biden. Any Democrat that thinks this entire Burisma thing looks 100% clean is straight up delusional. The GOP told Trump to quiet down and save that ammo for the general. It's the only reason they stopped with Burisma. The republicans are withholding all their attacks. There's more related to Hunter
I get it; he's better than Trump. But my god can we stop handing Republican's our nominee on a silver platter with an apple in his mouth? 

If we lose this election I'll be expecting a new party[comment]Sorry to say[comment]Biden has no chance to beat trump. If she supports him she cares more about pleasing the establishment than her actual positions on any issue.
[comment]Sorry someone is angry at her. this is serious and everyone knows biden=4 more years of trump. So people should be pissed.  If she supports biden she is not progressive[comment]I'm so torn over all this because I want a progressive candidate so badly. Warren[comment]That is a cool way to paint Bernie as an extremist ... very cool and so unfair subtly nasty I think.      
Yes quite nasty.     
She doesn't blame it on Bernie but his baseAnd of course the base is placed aside to the educated liberals who naturally like Ms Warren ... sorry but I am a little bit educated and I like Mr Sanders.       

She also gives us the practical key work as opposed to what ?  ... solving issues ? Because this is the focus of Bernie's action.      
So the revolution ending shot rings like the bells of the Churches of Petrograd in 1917. But wait Bernie is absolutely not Lenin ... this is not an Alter net reality here.     
No   
And I don't think that Canada or Europe are that much revolutionary and I am quite impressed by their health care system.
[comment]Two words: Russian trolls. Y‚Äôall are falling into the exact same trap as 2016.
[comment]If we are practical and want Trump gone above all else
He is benefiting so much from people not really paying attention to him because other candidates were more fun to talk about. He won't last in actually watched debates.

He is much less likely to win. This panic at Bernie is insane and self destructive. 

I love Warren. She's made some political mistakes that annoy me[comment]Berniecrat here.

I was immediately totally banned from the Warren subreddit for making a common sense suggestion to not make her campaign entirely about her gender.

I don't care what happens to her if they want that kind of policing.

Biden is a million times better than Trump but he'd rather please white nationalists and insurance companies than produce clean progressive legislation.  I'll be voting for Biden if it cones down to that but only for the Supreme Court because anything he tries to do will be gimped by extreme white nationalist oligarchs.
[comment]Count me as one who has been alienated by Bernie's usually aggressive base. I don't buy the "oh they're just passionate" b.s. anymore.
[comment]That could be true. The only thing we know for sure is that warren is NOT a viable candidate in this race. Voters have spoken; she got THIRD in her home state. It doesn‚Äôt matter where her supporters go but she needs to drop. It‚Äôs a two person race now.
[comment]Boomers have spoken[comment]I'm one of these people.  I'm voting for Warren on Tuesday
At this point
I started feeling cautious optimism this year as things went on - but this is going to be another election of memes.
[comment]Unfortunately[comment]I‚Äôm hoping for Sanders Warren 2020.
[comment]I don't know why anybody would pick Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren. She's actually accomplished things and is exactly the right age to be President.

I also don't know why people would assume that Warren supporters would be more likely to go with Sanders than Biden. Personally[comment]What a cowardly attitude[comment]That‚Äôs me. I was a Warren voter[comment]What a load of Orwellian doublespeak. "That Joe Biden is double plus good"!
[comment]‚ÄúThey want Trump gone more than they want a revolution‚Äù. You can literally have both[comment][https://apnews.com/0db953743c56cd6fd6e4ef73e02f120c](https://apnews.com/0db953743c56cd6fd6e4ef73e02f120c)

[title]AP Interview: Sanders says opposing Biden is 'irresponsible'
[selftext]https://apnews.com/a1bfb62e37fe34e09ff123a58a1329fa[comment]You can either function for Trump's protofascist movement or against it. 

##**There is no neutral on a moving train**

If you do not function against Trump's protofascist movement
Now is when we separate the compassionate and mindful from the credulous and self-absorbed. 

There is no neutral on the racism train either. You can either function against a white supremacist president
Are you with us[comment]And sadly he is correct...after that all bet a are off defeat Trump first. Than whatever impeach Biden I don't care
[comment]I'll always be a Bernie bro[comment]Bernie knows Donald trump is an existential threat to not only Americans[comment]Bernie is a very sensible and moral man. He was never going to throw in with Trump.
[comment]That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying and getting down-voted.
[comment]He‚Äôs right. Either you vote Biden or you‚Äôre voting for Trump (by voting third party or not voting at all).
[comment]Sanders is right. Every time the Democratic candidate has lost it's because someone on the Left split the vote.
[comment]Fuck yeah it is. Thank you Bern!
[comment]Sellout LOL
[comment]I still oppose Biden and the conservative-center of the party. 

I just oppose the GOP a hell of a lot more.
[comment]Anyone who thinks there's no difference between Trump and Biden
https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/
[comment]didn‚Äôt reddit call Yang a sellout for endorsing Biden also?
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to influence Biden‚Äôs campaign and allow a vision that works for both voter groups.

And fix the SCOTUS.
[comment]You mean that Trump isn‚Äôt honoring his commitments? Shocking!! üò±
[comment]Gotta hand it to the guy. Shame he‚Äôs out of the race.
[comment]So he finally learned how badly he damaged Clinton...I curse both trump and Bernie with the same breath...

[title]Bernie Sanders drops out of 2020 Democratic presidential primary
[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/bernie-sanders-drops-out-of-2020-democratic-presidential-primary.html[comment]I didn‚Äôt even get to vote in a primary before everyone dropped out. This is why we need a national primary day instead of a 6 month spread.
[comment]Finally did the right thing[comment]The writing was on the wall.  For better or worse[comment]I‚Äôd vote for my dog if I felt like the pup had a chance of taking the White House.  I‚Äôd have voted for Bernie had he been the nominee.  My sympathies to his die-hard supporters but there‚Äôs only one choice in the matter now.
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to fight hard to oust Trump and also reform healthcare in some way--perhaps not exactly the way he envisioned but in some capacity.
[comment]Fuck[comment]No refunds lol
[comment]We should be totally focused on trump now.
[comment]Biden is about as appealing as a bowl of room temperature mayonnaise.
[comment]So let me get this right[comment]sad
[comment]I'm surprised.  Maybe he thought it was best to come together[comment]Even if I can't elect Bernie[comment]Ah yes
Not a Bernie supporter at all and I do think Biden is the "best bet." But holy shit this is like saying the Oklahoma is the best bet of the Big 12 to win it all - its true but you'd much rather have a top team from any other Power 5 be your team.

My fear is he doesn't have the fight. He's too enlightened centrist to me. When/if the death toll hits 100k
Is it too late to draft Cuomo?
[comment]Blue. No. Matter. Who.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I liked Bernie. I voted for him in my states primary. But Biden has been winning the primaries left and right. 

Think of it this way. Who would you rather pick the next Supreme Court Justice: Trump or Biden?
[comment]So
Sounds like that group wasnt supporting Bernie at all.
[comment]Sanders has left the race and I feel that many of us will miss him for better or worst. Now[comment]Alright people[comment]Biden should tap Obama for the VP spot
[comment]‚ÄúJoe Biden is a man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the well being of working families and the middle class‚Äù

- Bernie Sanders[comment]Welp so much for my vote.
[comment]Unify or die is pretty much what it comes down to.

[comment]Trump‚Äôs own mental fitness is on now for all to see with these Corona Virus pieces on TV
[comment]I am worried about how general election voters will respond to Biden's gaffes. I think that the Democratic Party should nominate a candidate who does not have that problem.

[comment]Biden endorsed trump
[comment]So you're saying that for once Trump and his cronies are being honest. This is indeed an awkward moment.

[comment]Round two of putting a bad candidate with a scandal into the general election
I can't wait to hear the excuses as to why we need another "moderate" aka do nothing
Maybe we can run Hunter next. Gotta make sure it's a moderate with a scandal and all
Bring on the downvotes nerds.
[comment]Obviously the attacks on Bidens son are entirely reprehensible and I hope whoever the nominee is they strongly condemn them and fight back by pointing out the blatant illegality and ethical failures of the Trump administration in hiring his own children who are woefully under qualified for the positions they hold the time for the moral high ground for Democrats needs to be over. As far as Biden lacking the mental fitness to run the country I fully agree although it should be said so does Trump and we would be a lot safer and more prosperous under Joe no doubt but it's a weakness they will exploit and I fear he would lose. More concerning though is the Republican and Democratic establishments conviction and premature coronation of Biden as the nominee. I hope it doesn't go that way. He is and always has been Republican light with policies and votes going back decades that hurt Democratic values and economically vulnerable people. He won't be able to beat Trump by offering him out behind the woodshed and mixing his lines up. Bernie would be able to as the polling has shown for months by having the mental conditioning of a much younger man and the guts to go where is needed with rhetoric. Shame all of the nominees are old men in their swan songs and a shame so many people are frightened of the only Democratic candidate that espouses traditional Democratic values Joe leaning to the left now is disengenuous and risible.
[comment]I've seen some of this on Reddit already and I'm wondering if it is coming from Russian sources.
[comment]Ironic
[comment]Not sure why the Dems backing him.  Bernie and Elizibeth would be a good pick for President and VP.
[comment]What a shit show (and will only get bigger &amp; more ridiculous come November.) The rnp has no bar that they won't crawl under..and they will play EVERY dirty trick in the book..I've always been proud (in general) that the left has a standard- fair[comment]And it's true.

 Hahshahhahaha Trump is one to talk..no surprise he said this.
[comment]I mean he is bumbling.
[comment]For those of you that are saying that you can't believe what the attacks are going to be like later on here's how it's going to be[comment]That's been happening for the last year or so.
[comment]They are working on me. I‚Äôm voting Dems no matter what but I‚Äôve seen the videos and Biden DOES sound like he‚Äôs losing brain function terribly. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve doubled my efforts in phone banking for Sanders. I literally just see him as a slam dunk on Trump.
[comment]That last part is rich[comment]Trump is nothing compared to Corn Pop

[comment]That's what you get for swimming in the deep end. He should've never even been here to begin with. Just like Trump[comment]Not a fan of his[comment]I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt just walk off stage. How embarrassing! Warren just proved that she can handle a misogynistic idiot better than anyone.
[comment]This is like that one episode where Piper Perri got surrounded
[comment]He sucks so bad. I was mad that he was being allowed on the debate stage and after tonight I'm happy he was allowed on. Now everyone can see him for what he is. An old out of place rich man who has no clue as to what the american people want or like.
[comment]I actually felt badly for him.     He looked like he was going to cry.  Its sad!!   Whether or not you were planning on voting for him/like him the guy IS a legitimate businessperson and smart as heck (although he didn't come off this way).   He also didn't bully other candidates back (i.e. Trump).

 No need for another.

[comment]Great video. It is so true that people don't care about the lies. Tried to convince my office that a leader speaking truth on TV matters and they just reply with "all of them lie." It's so disappointing and frustrating. 

Unfortunately I don't think Biden can effectively do what the video suggests against the incumbent.
[comment]Yup I don't know how this guy does it.
[comment]Well done.
[comment]They tend to say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äú and that they know what he means/meant but seriously he doesn‚Äôt know what he means so how can they????

[comment]Because they're liars.

[comment]Nothing anyone does is ever going to move the needle below 32%. That‚Äôs all he needed last election. What we need is to reach people who normally don‚Äôt vote or who flipped from Bernie to trump last time. That‚Äôs it. Little else is worth discussing.

It's important to realize that people have been diagnosing the Trump phenomenon for as long as he's been in the public and political theaters. Not much of what she is saying is new.

[comment]What's funny is[comment]As a people we cultivated and allowed these adults to develop this way and now we get what we deserve.
[comment]Good video[comment]We need to build time-out centers in every shitty backwater town where these inbreeds show they‚Äôve learned that the only difference between being five and being an adult is that you can get away with being a dickhead as an adult. There‚Äôs no way to win with idiots.
[comment]Yes.  There is a role for policy and strategy which he won't understand or be able to counter.

But I agree with Bill Maher that Dems need to be less nice.  Trump is going to hit below that belt pretty hard.  He banks on his opponents weaknesses and shadiness.  To think we can remain "better than him" morally and kinder and expect to win is crazy.  Dems need to sling some mud too...and he's given us mountains of it to fling right back at him!
[comment]Trump is a product of right-wing media[comment]Of course. Appeal to emotion. Cognitive dissonance between feelings of inadequacy and superiority. It‚Äôs the same with conspiracy theory nuts
Very simply
You see it in republican policies too. It‚Äôs always about not letting anyone else get anything extra. It‚Äôs about applying negative consequences to others. 

Its people with damaged egos. It‚Äôs pretty easy to see. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs true; it makes me feel better‚Äù 

Also[comment]1. Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of 3 Million. She lost the Electoral College and she lost it by less than a million votes in states that are usually a Democratic win
2. The voters who support Trump no matter what
3. The voters we can appeal to are the ones who voted for Obama
I never understood why so many people hated Hillary on such a personal level
I don't think there is a big group of Biden haters. I don't think he has that kind of baggage. I don't think most people really care about Hunter Biden. The sexual assault allegations are disturbing
The Electoral College is a terribly unfair system and always has been. We're stuck with it until they can pass a constitutional amendment against it[comment]I posted another comment but I decided to let this one stand alone. 

This information is not a surprise. It‚Äôs the fundamental pillar of their entire strategy. All the misinformation and attempts to shape public opinion so blatantly. 

It started with Steve Bannon and World of Warcraft. He realized there exists a population of people who feel like they aren‚Äôt good enough or the world is screwing them over. This original group was the Incels on World of Warcraft. 

Bannon realized these people would manipulate their reality in order to make themselves look better to others
So he created Cambridge Analytica. This combined with existing misinformation systems
It‚Äôs truly fascinating how effective this has worked
Edit:  their image of trump is a rich and famous person who has power over everyone and gets to ‚Äústick it‚Äù to those who ‚Äúare mean‚Äù to him.  If I become rich and famous and powerful
It‚Äôs like a kid who was bullied In school dreaming of becoming a famous fighter.
[comment]Oh yeah[comment]Did she just say that Trump supporters have the reasoning of a 5 year old
If they don't listen to substance and don't care about policy[comment]Honestly they aren't even human beings. They are a disease that must be destroyed before it can spread
[comment]Yeah! Hillary never lied!
[comment]My dad can beat up your dad!!
[comment]I'm going to disagree. Facts are good[comment]"When you are overcome with powerlessness
You have to make fun of him and make him appear weak.
[comment]No[comment]Oh Biden‚Äôs definitely losing then
[comment]That's me - "CRYY... 'in. The blues!"
[comment]The sad thing is
The only surefire way to convince Trump voters to abandon him is for them to feel like he's abandoned them. Unfortunately
As much as I want stay-at-home orders to remain in effect until the threat is manageable
You can't shoot a virus. You can't vote against it. You can't write a law to stop it or make a deal with disease. There's no military or policy action that makes it go away.
[comment]I really think she came to the wrong conclusion.  As the first parts of the video explain[comment]So.... Bernie then?????
[comment]This is an insult to my 5 year old daughter.  She‚Äôs way more emotionally intelligent than that.
[comment]Cuomo already knows how to do this. I hope Biden gets it.
[comment]it would have been more effective to keep interviewing trump supporters
[comment]Most of them have the intellect of a 5 year old.
[comment]I have VERY little respect for Trump and his blind followers who can‚Äôt think for themselves. Maybe I will if they can advance their thinking to at LEAST a 10-year-old‚Äôs level<|startoftext|>
[title]Joe Biden on Twitter: I don't care who you're supporting[selftext]https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1236023348481724416[comment]Amen.
[comment]Well said
We may disagree on policy or who the better candidate is[comment]Amen Joe.
[comment]Like Republicans Joe? Like Republicans?
[comment]Now if only Bernie would shut down those BernieBots...
[comment]This is the unity Joe brings. Thank you!
[comment]100% agree[comment]Great words. It's time we got above this crap. 

Problem is with the interwebs[comment]This shows what a decent man he is. This is the man we want in the White House[comment]ThanksStill voting Bernie
[comment]Joe has my vote!
[comment]This was strategic but still a good thing to do.  Thanks Joe.

Still voting Bernie
[comment]Correct.
[comment]When are people going to wake up and realize all this hate[comment]hatred and bigotry are all the right has. its the theme of every one of trumps klan rallies
[comment]Wonder what Trump 's tweet about it would be
[comment]Joe's quickly becoming electable
[comment]Seems like a stunt.  Who was that guy ans what was he paid?
[comment]I don't know where the original story is but just r by eading some of the posts I can tell what it was about[comment]Thanks
I will vote for you and fight hard for you if you win[comment]This is what a real man looks like. joe biden has mine vote. Does he have yours?

Vote BLUE NO MATTER WHO. unite to fight the alt right.
[comment]Bernie was all about unity at his rally tonight too.  He did a good job of saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together and he has my support but here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm better.‚Äù  They‚Äôre aware of what R u ss i a is doing and doing a great job of combatting it.  Remember that.  If it seems divisive[comment]To bad he can't say a sentence this eloquently.
[comment]I‚Äôm happy that he‚Äôs being classy and humble. That‚Äôs the only way we can defeat trump. Unity
[comment]I voted for Warren. No regrets. And no matter which of these two wins the primary[comment]Tell 'em[comment]We have to pull together and vote for the nominee. Even if it‚Äôs Biden. I hate these nazi scumbags and especially that nazi pos in the WH
[comment]I'm not supporting Biden in the primaries[comment]Found directly at the Whitehouse in Washington DC where the orange maggot lives
[comment]I see people talking about Elizabeth Warren and to be honest I don't agree with all her policies but I don't agree with all of anyone's 100%[comment]I had no idea he was Jewish
[comment]The comments which are now deleted were vile. I'm disheartened. If you cannot look at a man condemning anti-Semitism and say simply say "Good": Fuck you[comment]Good!

I like Joe but I don't think he can beat trump and I worry about his memory.  

But the above message is exactly the thing Trump should be saying.  It's how a leader behaves!

Well done Joe and while you're on a role...

...Biden own campaign recently told Sanders
So I'd next like to see Biden explain that behaviour 
 Stop all the racism and bigotry from the top up!
[comment]This was a tough one[comment]I wonder if he apologized to the woman he called[comment]I voted for Bernie in my primary[comment]What were the attacks?
[comment]Nicely said Joe. I can‚Äôt vote or anything (and sorry[comment]Niw here is a decent man who in despite of his attacks from Sanders still defend Sanders jewish ancestry...would Sanders do the same? ??? NO
[comment]We need to unite and rally behind whoever gets the nomination. We have one single goal thisncycle: defeat trumpism. 
  
Also  
And stopping the stacking of the courts.
 
And restoring environmental regs.

And tackling climate change.
  
I mean: I want Medicare for all but I‚Äôll be a fucking deadman if I lose my ACA coverage.

[title]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how pathetic and awful a significant amount of republicans are?
[selftext]Like it was obvious before but Jesus now it‚Äôs slapping you in the face. The protests[comment]No[comment]Not exposed; just confirmed it in bright neon.
[comment]It confirms that many Republicans have decided to listen to their lesser angels[comment]Karma will surely serve them a plate of covefe 19...üòÜ
[comment]This is literally all they've ever been. Even the corporate sellouts in our camp have the decency to at least pretend they care about human life.
[comment]Hatefulness has a political party. It's never been more obvious.
[comment]Yes. I‚Äôve been trying to assume the point of view of trumpists/republicans and I caught myself thinking: The way we view them is most likely the way they view us. They‚Äôre incapable of seeing the light. They look at us like we‚Äôre the bad guys just like we view them. Just a thought.
[comment]Yes. The surprise is how many Democrats this has exposed as not having the best interests of the people or the Democratic process in mind. Our system is truly broken and beyond repair.
[comment]They deserve to lose every election for the next hundred years. As it is[comment]I think it was perfectly obvious before Covid-19...but maybe that's just me? ü§î
[comment]You could have groups shooting people in the streets and there would still be a good amount of money and power supporting them because it's more profitable to have the American people fighting each other
[comment]Of the two parties- only the GOP tries to suppress the vote. Limit voting places[comment]C19 has VALIDATED HOW COMPLETELY VILE THE REPEWBS ARE.    BLUE WAVE!
[comment]Just par for the course really. Money rules that party and you are a means for them to get richer. 

If anything
As well[comment]I mean[comment]Absolutely. And I hope we don‚Äôt forget it once we get Trump out of office. We might be friendly for now with ‚Äúmoderate Republicans‚Äù who hate Trump
Healthcare is a human right. Climate change is real. Immigrants make our country stronger in nearly every way. Women have a right to their own bodies. Voting rights matter. The GOP denied these fundamental truths long before Trump took office and they will do so even after he leaves.
[comment]It was already confirmed. This just reinforces it.
[comment]From my perspective[comment]I don‚Äôt think it needed confirmation.
[comment]I don't think anyone has the market cornered on bad decisions. Covid 19 just adds insult to injury.
[comment]They really have shown their true colors
[comment]Coronavirus isn't in human form and they can't apply the politics of personal destruction to something that can't speak
There is no straw man that can be made here.  It doesn't care about your politics and it also can't be vilified so Skeeter can say he's mad it wore a tan suit or "What about the coronavirus's emails?!!" in a feigned fit of outrage.
[comment]We as Democrats need to FINALLY grow a sack and play the game on the same terms as they are or they will just continue on doing whatever the hell they want as they have been doing since the 1970‚Äôs.....üòî
[comment]Conservatives subreddit is absolute cancer
[comment]Yes! A lot of Trumpicans can't bear the thought that their leader has fumbled this crisis hard so they shun reality and the science behind it. And as we've seen from the armed protests and two pipebomb arrests[comment]Republicans have been this awful my entire life. I feel like younger people just were totally not exposed to them on such a massive scale under the previous 8 years of Obama.
[comment]The insecurity is borne by the realization that this is the nail in Trump's coffin. Up till the coronavirus[comment]Known for a while now
[comment]You better VOTE!!!
[comment]We already knew lol. We can only hope it‚Äôs been exemplified to those who are more moderate. I think what‚Äôs it‚Äôs really shown is blind loyalty to party lines
People and politicians who are acting like total a**holes in all of this. The ones disobeying mandates[comment]I wasn‚Äôt surprised just very

Pls Vote in November.
[comment]It's been obvious for a while but this has hopefully exposed how awful conservatives are to anybody who was considering voting against their own best interests and voting for them
[comment]It exposed just how terrible our government as a whole is. To say one half did amazing while the other half did piss poor is quite off base. It‚Äôs not cute when they‚Äôre in Washington bickering like children over legislation. They all get a huge thumbs down from me.
[comment]Thing that gets me is the fear based denial. And then they'll roll over and play the victim just to blame you for exercising a measured response for dealing with the fearful reality of a global pandemic.
[comment]The mental gymnastics required to support Trump and his boot-lickers at this point are truly mind boggling.
[comment]Yes. Yes I do.
[comment]Pressure exposes patterns.
[comment]"Your deaths for rich people are a sacrifice I am more than willing to make." /Republicans more or less (Probably)
[comment]I don't think it's fair to compare as Democrat vs Republican. I typically vote red but I'm still at home and don't agree with the protesting idiots and I also wouldn't call myself a republican. I think a significant amount of those "republicans" are just people who operate from their lower brain and spout Trump as their savior. Can you really be so far in one camp or the other to label yourself?

I guess my thought is that I wish people were more idea/policy leaning than red/blue team leaning. I've never voted a straight ticket...
[comment]Nah[comment]Depends on how sensitive you are to this sort of thing.

If you are highly sensitive
If you were just sensitive
If you were moderately interested but not sensitive to this sort of thing at all
If you had a passing interest
If your interest wasn't passing but you had any awareness
If you don't know by now either you are one of them or you have your head up your ass and like it there[comment]I think the absolute craziest part for me is that there are people out there that not only are on with this but support it in a full throated manner
[comment]Yes. Everyday Every second Every issue
[comment]I think it‚Äôs exposed how pathetic and awful a lot of people are
[comment]All. All of them.
[comment]Hey[comment]Imagine you could see all the headlines of just this year about what the GOP and trump has done during the 2016 election. 

Think ‚ÄúHer Emails‚Äù would have been an issue?
[comment]I‚Äôve seen quite a bit of bigotry of late. Almost exclusively from my non democrat friends. I was surprised at how many self described independents have hate as well
[comment]Ok
I'm probably closest to a republican as things go... How does this expose anything?
[comment]I think Trump did that. Before he came along I thought they deserved a seat at the table.
[comment]You're just saying that because you want your party to be in power.

/S
[comment]No. Definitely not. It exposed how underestimating we we were.
[comment]I agree with the general sentiment[comment]Conservative here. There is a reason I call myself a conservative and not a republican. The Republican Party platform contradicts itself on so many instances I just can‚Äôt. I still hold right wing views[comment]it has shown me how pathetic ALL our politicans are.  driven by party politics and greed.
[comment]I‚Äôm not sure you noticed[comment]It shows that both parties don't care about us. Not just Republicans. Do you guys really think the Democrats are working for you and not there corporate donors?
[comment]You mean every day*
[comment]Every damn week[comment]Whats just as bad is people believing whatever they are told. This ridiculous "Plandemic" video has gotten me in trouble with family because it makes me so angry that they watch and believe what these nutjobs are saying!
[comment]Every day the indecency is more obvious. If Americans were really the kind of people that I grew up thinking they were[comment]People in general...
[comment]No .
[comment]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how stupid and awful a significant amount of Democrats are?
[comment]Lol you're just speaking the truth based on facts.

No think.

The covid massacre has shown 1) how fucking dangerous China under xi really is.  2) that trump really has no empathy.  3) that his supporters are brainwashed and or evil.  4) the gop are fucking terrorists and traitors who put human life after personal gain.  5) America is heading towards it's 3rd civil war.
[comment]I feel like it‚Äôs not fair to make a general statement that states all republicans are like this. While I disagree with many

But yeah[comment]No I‚Äôve know for near thirty years how gross pathetic and awful republicans and conservatives are. They are a blight and cancer on this nation and in their own way a population forcing the rest of us to be better and confront the awfulness that is a hallmark of their ideology.
[comment]Have you seen r/trump? My god the people on that sub are small but make up for it ok stupidity.
[comment]just wondering what platform they will campaign on in future elections. they have flipped on everything.no morals[comment]I really want to caution anyone who will listen from adopting this attitude. At the end of the day
Are there some really shorty republicans elected officials right now? I would say yes. This is most likely due to the fact that republicans more commonly get elected
We the people are the ones who control whether these officials get to remain in power[comment]You know how they say that money doesn't change a person but rather exposed who they really are?  With covid-19[comment]Covid-19 just reveals what‚Äôs been revealed time and again with Republicans not standing up to the Liar in Chief[comment]The democrats should also be grouped into this
[comment]Especially Rush Limbaugh. His show became exclusively blame the left all day. 
I have listened to it for many years out of interest in the Republican arguments. It was fun to try and deconstruct his craziness and see how he attempted to influence his listeners in roundabout ways.
But now it's straight "the left is evil and wants to destroy America" all dayThen I switch to NPR where they use facts and real people's stories...
[comment]Just read about Germans before World War Two. Republicanism is the same. A garbage culture fueled by ignorance and hatred.
[comment]Democrats too[comment]If the pandemic is the thing that finally is making you see that...fuck you...they have been heartless demons for years now...not that the dems do anything to really stop them though...
[comment]It's also exposed how weak and feckless most democratic leadership is as well. Fuck the republicans but damned if pelossi and shcumer arent more useless than tits on a fish.
[comment]Cancerous traitorous monsters
[comment]Nah it‚Äôs just confirmed that people priorities are whipping there ass and having a fashionable face mask I mean if you look at that way you shouldn‚Äôt have any political say lol if ya think about it we all live in the same place and should have similar goals and yet we have two parties with conflicting goals which leads one to ask why? Personally I think they in it together and use the media to divide people to obtain their personal goals so In away your halfway right but instead of keeping a better eye on one side how bout keeping full attention on the whole fuck show
[comment]I am 36. 

For me it was the Iraq War. For people before that it was Reagan. Bush 1 was[comment]About 10% more than I felt I knew. But I think it's more public now
[comment]Trump is vowing to destroy Obamacare in a pandemic; we gave the most extensive distribution of wealth in history to billionaires[comment]I live in Salt Lake city
It's almost as if being a selfish bastard is a requirement for the republican party these days.
[comment]It's almost like Mother Nature said 'you didnt get it with Irma[comment]Let's not forget the Dems too. Utter disappointment across the board. We need a new party that truly represents the working class.
[comment]Confirmed it for sure. Pure evil. One of my Pok√©mon friends left our 3 year group chat because we were complaining about the Rs
[comment]The huge number of Republican conservatives who don't believe the virus is real or that it's made by the government blows my mind. I have friends who call it the "plandemic."
[comment]Omg have you seen all their plandemic posts lately
[comment]You must be new here
[comment]Here's an idea. How about stop being so hateful just because people have different political views than you. This world will be better if people looked past these differences instead of this tribal partisan crap
[comment]Not really. It's always been pretty obvious to me.
[comment]I did Nazi this coming.

Seriously though
Unfortunately[comment]I‚Äôm republican and even I question my own party. We‚Äôre protesting against science and bowing to a man who hasn‚Äôt helped[comment]Not since Covid[comment]Largely
I still think there has to be room for dissent from mainstream thought (which I believe leans more from moderate left to far left) but yeah[comment]It highligts there low inteligece in extrem stiuations like this[comment]Democrats have been screaming hysterically for 3 years about nonsensical Russian conspiracy theories
You guys need to have your heads examined.

[title]New Rule: Just because Fox News is obsessed with the Biden sex assault allegations[selftext]https://youtu.be/Ju1ZFuvjzYc[comment]#AMEN!
[comment]If only they covered the 25+ Trump accusations. It's a little less credible you are innocent when a dozen women accusing you isn't even half of the total number.
[comment]Well this was eye opening... üëÅüëÅ
[comment]I'd broaden that: just because cable TV news fixates on certain stories (those differ between networks) doesn't mean anyone else needs to fixate on them.

I recall a few years ago when Lawrence O'Donnell had Michael Avenati on his show almost daily.

What sells the most ads may not be what provides the best information for the citizenry.
[comment]And once again....right wingers and Bernie Bro‚Äôs team up. And no one can extrapolate this unholy alliance to the notion that Russian and the Trump administration is in cahoots to keep this shit relevant?

I sincerely find it amusing that the Limbaugh crowd constantly talks about right wingers having this almost supernatural ability for ‚ÄúCritical thinking‚Äù
I find it equally amusing that the ‚ÄúFeel the Bern‚Äù people are so ‚Äúwoke‚Äù...but cannot admit to it that they are being played.

The sad thing about the Bernie people? Is that they fell for it in 2016....they were so CONVINCED that Clinton had a sex trafficking ring in the basement of a pizza shop. You would think that they‚Äôd be ‚Äúwoke‚Äù enough to not fall for the same bullshit twice.

But....like the hard right? They are more married to their ideology than reality and finding the truth.
[comment]All aspects of these allegations from Reade are very suspicious not the least of which is "Why now when he is the presumptive nominee?"
[comment]Fuck this.....we should be obsessed
[comment]Alternatively we could hold our politicians accountable. Yeah fox should have given legitimate coverage to trumps numerous accusers. That doesn‚Äôt mean we just sweep inconvenient things under the rug because our political opponents have no dignity.
[comment]Let‚Äôs put trump‚Äôs accusations on the board
Oh wait! His supporters don‚Äôt give a shit.
[comment]Man we can do better than this take.  This is cheesy af and we deserve to get blasted by the right for flipping so hard on women's issues.
[comment]They know he's a threat to defeat Trump[comment]Trump has already shown he is willing to cheat and break the law and fabricate non-stories to smear Biden. Why should we believe anything they ~~make~~ dig up on him?
[comment]Omg all of you fuckers are saying the exact same thing trump's supporters are saying about his accusers.
[comment]The goal of the Bernie Bros is to destroy Joe Biden. The goal of Fox is to attack the rest of the media and scream "double standard!" over and over again.

The Democrats had better wake up. The Republicans plan on campaigning on Alternate Reality where the Mueller Report exonerated Trump[comment]Maybe the dems should not have a picked a vulnerable candidate again.
[comment]Is that Putin love letter real?
[comment]as a democrat we should 100% take this just as seriously as the allegations against trump. You can't just pick and choose like this
[comment]OR... we could prove ourselves to NOT be hypocrites and hold Biden just as accountable as we did Trump.
[comment]The hypocrisy of the Democrats has turned me so far away from the party. It's so disappointing. The Democratic party has as much integrity as rock. 

You should all be ashamed.
[comment]Oh my god this is so embarrassing. It‚Äôs the exact reason why young people aren‚Äôt gonna turn out for Biden b/c we‚Äôve come to understand how hypocritical and stand-for-nothing Democrats are
[comment]I agree that there should be more focus on Trump's scandals too[comment]Meanwhile during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings...
[comment]Glad that Bill said this[comment]One case is one case too many. Why vote in a rapist when you have Bernie
[comment]‚ÄúBelieve all women until it‚Äôs not profitable‚Äù you guys are disgusting[comment]Why would we ignore these allegations?
[comment]I think we should vote on who Obama[comment]I bet he wished he had been more critical of the Russiagate stuff considering the new findings about the lack of evidence for "Russian meddling."
[comment]President pussygrabber is so far ahead of Biden in accusations...they should be  concerned the media will start comparing their appetites for grabbing lady parts...Biden was better and vice president for eight years...it didn't seem to bother him then....non issue

[comment]Holy FUCK finally a reporter calls his incompetence out to his face.
[comment]An embarrassment to this country. Total idiot
[comment]I clapped when I heard this question. Wasn't there[comment]Just for perspective
Just 3[comment]yeah that 60-70 number is not happening now

why couldn't he just have lied and said 100 or 120 at least[comment]Whew
[comment]Grading on a trump scale this was a coherent answer
[comment]Wow. He essentially said: ‚Äúat least I‚Äôm not responsible for 2.2 million deaths‚Äù
[comment]What ? Damn[comment]I mean listen I‚Äôm no trump supporter but what kind of question is that? I understand the incompetence of trump[comment]Fun fact[comment]Lame....
[comment]Jesus that‚Äôs a bold question.
[comment]It feels like he‚Äôs been coached since the shit show last week. 

Not that it helped.
[comment]40 countries have done more testing per capita than the US.
[comment]He takes no responsibility.
[comment]Nobody wants to talk about ventilators because 1) the situation evolves 2) tragically they are largely ineffective in improving outcomes

Hey as long as you‚Äôre a super genius why not invent a time machine and stop yourself from firing the pandemic task force.
[comment]Wait[comment]This question is unfair. How would Trump know? He dodged Vietnam.
[comment]That reporter is awesome.
[comment]I mean[comment]I'm actually genuinely surprised that he didn't resort to name-calling the reporter like he normally does...
[comment]What a shockingly dumb and arrogant question. You can certainly ask tough questions about this[comment]Classic dodge the question
[comment]The greatest con artist of all time is getting better and better...
[comment]What a delusional fuck he is
[comment]The CDC issued its first warning on Jan 8. 

Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9
He golfed on Jan 18
The first time he admitted the coronavirus might be a problem was Mar 13.
[comment]I‚Äôm very surprised he didn‚Äôt call the person out for asking such a ‚Äúnasty‚Äù question üôÑüôÑ
[comment]No!
[comment]I‚Äôm convinced he was wearing an earpiece &amp; getting correction anytime he veered off-course. If you watched the whole presser[comment]WW1 had 53k combat deaths
675k died from the spanish flu.

Trump is not a good president nor does he seem like good person but the comparison between Vietnam combat deaths amd this pandemic is invalid.  It's not even apples and oranges comparison[comment]Even if Trump had tried to do anything[comment]This outbreak is his personal Vietnam.
[comment]I think a lot of us owe her a beer[comment]The COVID-19 deaths were not president Trump's fault. It's not his fault that there is a new[comment]I mean... is that really fair? This virus was going to hit no matter what and
But considering we are still below that very optimistic estimates of deaths[comment]The great [Olivia Nuzzi](https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi)[comment]I'm actually shocked that he didn't just yell at her for being "an awful reporter
This was one of the most coherent answers he's ever given[comment]I'm not even American and feeling angry[comment]yeah but[comment]How can he argue they are doing well through this when countries who acted properly have far less fatalities per capita?
[comment]Trump claimed STD's were His Vietnam.  His boys are among the least intelligent humans on earth and they have immense influence. Our military claims something but they don't remember.  Where did six trillion go...
Thank you for your service white supremacy.
[comment]No[comment]He didn't answer the question and he congratulated himself.
[comment]Such a liar
[comment]well he didn't answer the question and all he did was congratulate himself[comment]No one said 2.2 million people would die.  He is using the old word salad to lessen the blow
"Hey mom and dad[comment]If he had done what they did in California we would have 1/3 the cases and 1/5 the deaths.

And he knew and could have acted long before leadership in California did.
[comment]Absolutely not!  Vote Blue!
[comment]&gt;"So
That's not going to age well.
[comment]He's actively increasing the number of deaths. It's like him co-operating with the virus itself (or competing with it)...
[comment]"I think... I think... I think..." What you think doesn't fucking matter. Face the facts!
[comment]Humm was the 40k Americans allowed to return from China put into quarantine or
We‚Äôre they just allowed in so they could spread the virus ?
[comment]The problem is that he answers with such an avalanche of complete lies[comment]Trump should never have allowed anyone to return to the country from anywhere when this thing hit. We wouldn't be where we are at right now[comment]Oh man[comment]All the points about Trump's overall awfulness are true. He's a dangerous monster. That said[comment]And all the while Trump defenders will still eat up his shit.

[comment]The fact that he was elected in the first place still boggles the mind. I really did not think there were *that* many stupid Americans.
[comment]It's a truly
Whether x number of people die has nothing to do with any comparison to a high mortality event (such as a war); it has to do with the intrinsic nature of the death dealing event in conjunction with the competence of response. To put it in the general terms she uses about "a POTUS"

This guy sucks.
[comment]In the same six weeks
The US ranks near the bottom of western countries in per capita infections and per capita deaths  Without NYC metro
The reporter is either a total idiot or a Democrat operative hired to smear Trump with lurid nonsense..
[comment]I'm surprised that Trump can answer this in his normal voice and not being angry and call reporters 'fake news'. :D

[title]Reminder: Russian trolls are active on reddit to create division between Biden and Bernie[selftext]https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-detailed-2016[comment]I know some Bernie Bro‚Äôs who are not Russian Trolls but they are actively trying their best to destroy Biden. They‚Äôre doing the same thing they did four years ago where they are advocating writing Bernie on to their ballots.

They do more harm than the Russian trolls in my opinion.
[comment]I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Russian trolls or Bernie Bros[comment]Sandersforpresident has been extra toxic lately.
[comment]It's not just Russia btw. There are covert conservative funded propaganda campaigns as well.

&gt; Did the Russians actually do these things? Maybe. It‚Äôs not confirmed either way. The sourcing even today remains tied to the same people who‚Äôve lied about a thousand other things&gt;  
&gt; The United States&gt;  
&gt; The logic of Russiagate is now beyond absurd. Vladimir Putin&gt;  
&gt; That this is a dumb story is characteristic. The people pushing it don‚Äôt have any smart arguments left for remaining in power. Through decades of corporate giveaways[comment]Ummm...yea[comment]The Bernie subreddits are really full of Russians right now.
[comment]I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised[comment]While this is clearly what we expected from the start[comment]I would not be surprised if they are on reddit
I remember seeing loads of imgur posts that were lying about what was in wikileaks dumps (e.g. attributing quotes by Ben Carson to Democrats) and thought in retrospect they could be Russian[comment]Also the Chinese. Also the Republicans
[comment]reminder: joe biden's a shit candidate[comment]Perhaps it's also best to keep in mind that just because someone criticizes your candidate or their platform does not inherently mean it's some undercover conspiracy. It surely is happening
Political discussion is seldom pretty[comment]Yes[comment]I noticed it big time the last five days.  I informed the moderators of r/feminism they were being brigaded by trolls going after Biden with a common theme and they were so thankful for my input that they banned me.

Also
I implore you if you are a Bernie supporter[comment]This election won't be lost or won because of Russian trolls
You have to lean forward into this stuff[comment]Biden and his record has done a fine job of convincing me never to vote for him. And I've voted Dem my entire 20-year voting history.

I bit my tongue and voted Hillary in 2016
Biden is showing no leadership right now
It is clear who the next president should be
So you can either lose with Biden or win with Bernie. It's your choice.
[comment]Itstead of just being the town crier let‚Äôs get some posts with what our counter measures are to be. Please.
[comment]What's really shitty about this is we have to have rely on the Mueller report for information about this. That was released a year ago and against the objections of the president. We should have the FBI releasing regular reports on these misinformation campaigns. We need a president who will take our national security seriously.

[comment]Biden kinda sucks though.
[comment]You know I just thought of one thing. If we have to go to vote by mail for the November election it might actually stop the Russians from hacking the voting machines and handing Trump another election. The counting machines likely won't have anything to do with the vulnerable electronic machines.

[comment]Bernie supporter here...nothing pisses me off more than how aggressive Biden supporters have been on this subreddit. Just when I think eh whatever i'll vote Biden I see this shit and the comments and think how much do you have to blame other countries to hide their same old status-quo agenda's? You want the Bernie voters to come you will need to get your heads out of Biden's ass and push him to compromise with progressives more. FACT.    

SideNote: Remember Bernie supporters are mostly 30 and younger we know the difference between fake news unlike Biden supporters...
[comment]You should repost this every day from now until the election to remind us.
[comment]That may well be. But with news about Biden sexually assaulting his staff person...if I have to choose between Trump and Biden I'll stay home. There may be people who are causing issues on purpose[comment]The real problem is that it makes you question authentic sentiment. 

There are plenty of people who like Bernie and don‚Äôt like Biden

[title]Until my dying day I will never understand why Hillary Clinton‚Äôs existence causes so many people‚Äôs brains to melt into pudding. It‚Äôs just baffling on every level and anytime anyone tries to explain why they hate her so much they sound like raving fucking lunatics.

It takes a special kind of person to listen to 30 year so that and not turn off. 

The kind of person that needs an enemy. The kind of person that needs to hate.
[comment]A highly successful GOP psyop started in 1990.
[comment]In 2016 I was all aboard the Bernie train. During the primaries I ingested all the anti-Hillary flak. A lot of it was petty stuff and of course there was the obvious BS like Benghazi and her emails
Disclaimer: When it came down to her vs Trump I sprinted to my polling place to vote for her over him. I'm not a moron.
[comment]Clearly these people just needed a tiny push[comment]Misogyny. Contempt for women is a National past time.
[comment]Really though they voted for and continue to support Trump.
[comment]It started with her work on Watergate.  Then[comment]Her support of Bill‚Äôs ‚Äòtough on crime‚Äô stance is just one of many examples that she was rightly criticised by the left for co-opting populist reputation policies. It‚Äôs hard to argue that she wasn‚Äôt just a shell without principles that would say or do whatever it took to get elected.
[comment]Hey
He's a 2020 Trump supporter now and writes articles about how Sanders supporters should switch to Trump.

Imagine that.
[comment]I like her well enough as a human being. But her voice could sometimes be a bit unpleasant.
[comment]I remember back in the '16 cycle someone had a tweet simmering to the effect of "if you have an issue with voting for Hillary over Trump[comment]She‚Äôs got a better kdr then me for one
[comment]I used to just chalk it to straight misogyny[comment]Because Dems don't think for themselves[comment]Bernie will win. He doesnt have an expiration date. 

This country is a goddamn nightmare[comment]Maybe you should learn something from Hillary's complete inability to inspire change. 

Like if I'm being honest I think the democratic party really hates having complete power because that means they have to deliver to their voters while pretending to protect capital and the rich assholes who own the party. 

America NEVER had a labor party. We NEVER had a voice for working people. We have a half assed corporate monstrosity that sells us a dream and then hands it to the republicans every fucking 8 years. And yes that includes Obama.

I hate this whole system i want it completely burnt to the ground.
[comment]It all begins with the Nytimes and William Fucking Safire.

[comment]I think it‚Äôs the fake blonde hair; makes her look dishonest.

[comment]I felt like I decently liked Hillary since she‚Äôs a wonkyBut I‚Äôve been disappointed in her behavior post 2016 election.
[comment]I mean I admit I don‚Äôt like her politics but I did support her over Donald and the level of hate it goes to for a lot of people is... something else.
[comment]Because the Clinton's are evil[comment]Australia had the same with its Democratic equivalent party[comment]I don't hate her. I hate her neoliberal policies[comment]I think a lot of Democrats (including myself) are a bit salty about the perceived wrong doing in the 2016 primaries re: Bernie. I think the Republicans simply drank the Fox kool-aid. In any case she'd be a better candidate that Trump by miles[comment]My biggest problem with Hillary running for president was that she is the spouse of a past president. I didn't like Bush jr for the same reason. We should be discouraging such type of relationships and a single family holding such a prominent office for multiple terms. I did vote for her over Trump but ideologically i hated myself for it.

In 1975Hilary Clinton defended her rapistFollowing this[comment]To act like there‚Äôs no reason to dislike her is dishonest. 

It is disproportional to Trump though. The right usually shouts Benghazi whenever asked for a reason to hate her
Having said that[comment]I‚Äôm a Dem[comment]Faux News
[comment]She encompasses everything that is wrong with this neoliberal ideology. She sees foreign policy as a chess board where everything is about countering Russia. Never on the side of anti-intervention or stopping regime change wars. Still blames her loss on Russian intervention instead of her not campaigning in the rust belt. Stole the election for Bernie 

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

She was the definition of an establishment candidate. And people are sick and tired of the status quo

This is the same shit as everyone freaking out because Kamala Harris dropped out. Blaming it on racism and sexism rather than her being a terrible candidate. She did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for financial crimes because he was a big democratic donor.
 https://theintercept.com/2017/01/05/kamala-harris-fails-to-explain-why-she-didnt-prosecute-steven-mnuchins-bank/

[comment]I like this response the most.

&gt;Women who seek political power are a threat to patriarchy. White women who are aware of their privilege and can effectively articulate it are a threat to white supremacy. Hillary Clinton did both so some people were really upset[comment]I always assumed it started in Bill‚Äôs presidency. She tried to push through a number of things (like health care reform - damn her! /s) and refusing to stay in her lane.

The biggest issue with what they did to Hillary isn't that they endlessly attacked her... it's that the Democratic base abandoned  her by starting to believe at least some of the various attacks they've done on her.

[comment]If Hillary doesn‚Äôt want the hate[comment]Here are two facts; one which Democrats can't accept
* Hillary was the target of the conservative brainwashing machine. They hate her because (knowing she was the next primary candidate for the presidency)  the Right spent years demonizing her in a never-ending faux news cycle of hate.
* Hillary would have made a mediocre president. She's too close to corporate money to actually have represented We The People.

An observation:  In a (perhaps sick) philosophical sense[comment]It's been over 3 years. Time to get over it?
[comment]I don't hate her
What I do find deeply disturbing is that the right-wing machine that exists to paint her as the 'antichrist' has mostly succeeded in regards to people who already disliked her.

[title]Megathread for tonight's Biden/Sanders Democratic Debate
[selftext]**We invite you to discuss tonight's Democratic Debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders beginning at 8:00 EST and 5:00 PST. Please be respectful and stick to the issues.**


--------------


**The debate will air exclusively on CNN[comment]Biden and Bernie really need some sun--both look so pale!!     I hope they attack Trump instead of each other.      Bernie personally comes off as a better "debater" and makes fewer mistakes especially on healthcare.
[comment]Honestly[comment]Answer the question Bernie. What would you do **now.**
[comment]Biden is taking the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù approach with saying everything in regards to COVID-19 would be free. Bernie is trying to get the point across that his plan for M4A would provide a better foundation or defense[comment]Biden is steady like he‚Äôs ready to take the role.


All this smearing of his brain power is going to be blown away tonight.
[comment]Bernie keeps talking our healthcare system and how it should be changed in the future. That does not address the crisis. We need to address what to do today.
[comment]It's not Ebola[comment]I'm finding Biden's behavior really awkward.
[comment]Did Biden just credit himself for stopping a great depression?
[comment]How do we feel about immigrants also getting healthcare?  I would normally say no but seems crucial in times like these
[comment]Bernie doing one of his rants instead of answering Joe's questions about how to pay for it.
[comment]Wait did Joe Biden just straight up lie twice??üò¨üò¨üò¨
[comment]‚ÄúI still won!‚Äù
[comment]I expected this debate to be focused primarily on the coronavirus
[comment]Biden is getting hammered.
[comment]Imagine a Biden-Sanders ticket though.  If Biden were to offer and Bernie were to accept[comment]So Bernie has decided to just lie and take everything back to his stump speech
Leadership sometimes requires working with reality[comment]I never thought I would say this[comment]Bernie out there blazin Joe up
[comment]Neither one of these clowns have a prayer in hell of beating Trump. with their policies your taxes will be through the roof and gas prices will be $4-5  a gallon.
[comment]Biden has answered every question in a numbered list format
[comment]So they asked Bernie why his message isn‚Äôt resonating with African Americans and he talks about turning out young and latino vote?

Given an opportunity to speak directly to us and this marg has NOTHING to say?
[comment]Every time Biden starts with "Number 1" I worry he's going to get lost on his rambling track to the next Number 1" story...
[comment]Where can I find a recorded version of it in Canada? I just happened to have missed it.
[comment]Biden did not try to bring progressives into the fold tonight. He lied about his past record and gave no solutions to what progressives care about. Bernie did not help himself either tonight. He needed to come at Biden way harder than he did. Biden gave one word answers
One last thing. The whole "how will you deal with the Coronavirus?" question is pretty pointless when you CANT do anything now at this moment if you ARE NOT the current president. It was a pointless question and won't be a concern once either candidate gain the office.
[comment][interesting fact checks](https://www.wkyc.com/mobile/article/news/verify/verify-fact-checking-the-11th-democratic-debate/95-394b8c45-40ac-4f66-8c21-d83e3641b177)

South Korea ALSO has a single payer health system. They[comment]Biden is a lying sack of shit. 


Let him go the whole way and I‚Äôll vote trump again.
[comment]1. Number one
2. Number one
3. First thing we got to do
4. Situation Room
5. Those 2 things
[comment]This more a thread about the moderators opinions than actually debating the debate.  Who is this guy?
[comment]Biden has allegedly lost thousands of voters after being caught put lying during debate.

https://youtu.be/nZ2WOT455MA
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter and I realize Biden is going to win.

But God damn is he doing a piss poor job of trying to pivot and unify the party no matter how you think he did at the debate.

Hillary didn't give a damn about trying to unify and it helped tank her.  Biden needs to stop bad mouthing M4A.  Say you don't think it could pass
This is going to be 2016 all over again till team Biden takes one of the like 10 olive branches Sanders was offering in that softball debate and actually works with the left to unify.  He can't just take it for granted like Clinton did.
[comment]Damn it's pretty crazy how many times Biden lied about easily provable facts about his record.  You guys think he's gonna do anything to reach out to Bernie's support base<|startoftext|>

Why are you all acting like sexist[comment]She‚Äôs nuts
[comment]Any standard should eliminate that Russian stooge from the debate stage. This shouldn't be anything surprising. She's been polling dead last for a while now. Time to take your ill gotten gains and your Kremlin backed ass out of there Tulsi.

[selftext]https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/us-election-2020-trump-joe-biden-economy-policies-republicans-democrats-a9537786.html[comment]Republicans need to be decimated as a political party.
[comment]They had three and a half years to do something about him.  They didn't.  Instead[comment]If only they had a chance to remove him....
[comment]Wouldn't it be funny if Hillary just ran against him again?

She‚Äôd only need one campaign slogan:

‚ÄúAre you better off today than you were four years ago?‚Äù
[comment]As long as people VOTE he will!
[comment]That's what the GOP thought during the 2016 election as well after the pussygrab video came out. But the deplorables just stuck with Trump's scam. I fear the bar has been lowered way down into hell this time around.
[comment]‚ÄúIf we nominate Trump[comment]They should have thought of that in February when they covered for him.
[comment]Well they're certainly not acting like it.
[comment]Biden doesn‚Äôt have a chance
[comment]What I cant understand is this hill they are dying on.  They could right now


Because they're going to cheat.
[comment]Ah yes[comment]Let just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange f√ºher from office. Common America it‚Äôs time üá∫üá∏
[comment]I mostly see posts that republicans are worried about an impending Biden landslide on democrat subs. This news while uplifting can unconsciously demotivate us to vote because ‚Äòit‚Äôs in the bag‚Äô so to speak.   I don‚Äôt know why we believe anything republicans say and truly
OP no disrespect
Downvote me to hades[comment]Landslide? Joe is damaging his campaign every time he opens his mouth. How is he going to debate when Freudian slips keep happening when cameras are on him?
[comment]Trump cultists haven‚Äôt budged. They love Trump even more now that he‚Äôs killed people with his lies and misinformation. They think he‚Äôs a hero and they‚Äôre ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù saving the economy from democRATs. Vote. Vote. For the love of God vote!
[comment]As a moderate[comment]Huh funny[comment]Just Vote.
[comment]Good.
[comment]tRump üòÜ is killing himself because he's sooo stupid üòÇ
[comment]They should just forfeit the whole fucking thing and save everyone the time and money.
[comment]Biden looks boss af in that pic. That‚Äôs a commander in Chief!
[comment]Niggers
[comment]They can always send another candidate if they want.
[comment]The "good" news here is the ignorant orange asshole is incapable of changing his strategy. He is convinced he is infallible so it has to be right.
[comment]If we had more democracy and everyone voted all that would happen is the GOP would have to adopt some more popular positions. The horror!
[comment]All Biden hast to do is not interrupt Trump while he‚Äôs beating himself
[comment]It needs to be a landslide loss to make it harder for Trump to cheat and steal.
[comment]How about just saying F politics
[comment]Well....well they should be. Mabe it will help them with that self-reflection stuff. I hope anyway.
[comment]They had their chance to get rid of him.
[comment]Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs another shit show of choices....Guess I have to vote for the hair smelling rapist over the racist murderer smh
[comment]Doesn't matter what anyone says or thinks. VOTE. VOTE like your VOTE will be the deciding VOTE. And don't only VOTE in major elections. VOTE in all your local elections too. Your county website should have all the info. If you can't find it[comment]As rosy as the situation is now<|startoftext|>
[title]10% of Trump 2016 voters might not vote for him in 2020 ‚Äî The persuadable Trump voter could swing the election in November.
[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21173431/swing-voters-trump-2020[comment]I refuse to believe this until I see it.

Remember when 25% of Republicans were expected to stay home in 2016 because they thought Trump was so disgusting? Their embarrassment to publicly admit they want to vote for Trump doesn't make their vote for Trump disappear.
[comment]Encouraging but I‚Äôm not gonna count on it
[comment]After reading through the numbers it is estimated that 5-9% of Bernie supporters voted for Trump. Some of those will again.
[comment]I'm one of those switchers.

I did a lot of maturing between 2016 and 2020.
[comment]¬£¬£
[comment]Given the age demographics of Republicans I would be surprised if 10% of Trump 2016 voters haven't died.
[comment]I would hope we could swing the election without them and they only matter in 3 states as we won the popular vote by over 3 million. The popular vote does not matter in our broken constitution with the electoral college compromise.
[comment]I never met a wishy-washy republican.
[comment]This presidential election is all about bringing out the base. The level of polarization the US electorate makes it unlikely to change anyone's mind about which team they support. Whoever does a better job bringing out their people to vote wins.
[comment]Great let's do m4a
[comment]We can only hope they find their way back.
[comment]50 percent of clintons voters may discover Joe to be more off-putting. So how will that balance out?
[comment]Well
But whoever wins the primary I am campaigning for.
[comment]Oh great! We are counting on a bunch of spoiled selfish conspiracy theorists to win the day. What could possibly go wrong?
[comment]Former Trump voter here
First
Anyway[comment]He has a 92% approval rate among the voters and this Party is shitting on Sanders supporters.
[comment]I made a mistake in 2016 and voted for trump[comment]They may catch windmill cancer too if they aren‚Äôt careful.
[comment]Surprised its only 10%.
[comment]Could this be true?
[comment]What the article doesn't discuss is where these potential vote flippers are located.   If they tend to be in blue states anyway[comment]Seems like wishful thinking. My question is how many Democrats (especially young people) are gonna be put off by a candidate who is anti abortion
America just isn't ready.
[comment]Biden is gonna get destroyed in those coming debates. Do we believe that Biden will travel the country doing rally‚Äôs? It‚Äôs gonna be ugly[comment]I was willing to vote for pretty much anyone but Biden. The Democratic Party is on the verge of selecting the one candidate I would vote for Trump over. So count me out of that "10%".
[comment]Good. I don't want more Trump.
[comment]They would have voted for Bernie. They resented Obama‚Äôs turn against his 08 progressive politics. They got suckerd by trumps false populism. They won‚Äôt vote for an Obama era guy that suckerd them once already.
[comment]The victory lies with the swing/independent voters. Been saying it for two years. Motivate your friends to register and vote at Vote.gov
[comment]Don‚Äôt forget Putin.. he wants the puppet.. he‚Äôll cheat for the win.
[comment]Trump is going to win again because our party just has no fucking clue how to unify.

Go on r/SandersForPresident \-- you'll find a huge number of people who will never vote for a democrat if Sanders loses.  

Republicans
Us[comment]Trump voters want an anti-establishment candidate. That candidate may be Trump and it may be Sanders[comment]that sounds about right. in the end[comment]If sanders doesnt make it im staying home[comment]So we need to go with a candidate that will pull those voters then.
[comment]Only 10%. People are so willfully ignorant.
[comment]That's okay[comment]&gt; "... The persuadable Trump voter ..."

* you mean any Jethro with a double digit IQ?

No doubt even his most idiot Russian shill bot backers are getting tired of shooting themselves in the foot and voting against their own interest.

And I don't want to hear shit about those morons wanting to "get sucked up to heaven"<|startoftext|>
[title]Michelle Obama Is Mad at Black Voters[selftext]https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflixs-becoming-shows-michelle-obama-is-mad-at-black-voters-not-trump-voters[comment]She is awesome. I wish she would be our veep because she would make a fantastic president.
[comment]I'm mad at everyone who didn't vote for Hillary in 2016 too[comment]Uhgg.  Couldn't agree more.  Not only in 2016 but especially 2010.  First black president and black voters couldn't even be bothered to show up in 2010 and let the Tea Party take over.    The Dem party shoots itself in the foot a lot.
[comment]Imagine being a political party where you get angry at a certain race for voting a certain way or not living their lives how you decided they should live their lives. Almost sounds like this party is ‚ÄúUsing‚Äù black people. What a shame.
[comment]What the hell is this shit? For one[comment]Call me crazy but I think people should WANT to vote for you[comment]You should blame the candidate not the voters. If you can‚Äôt get people to vote for you[comment]I feel the point she was making was more around[comment]Let‚Äôs be real. Black people dont vote. Even if Kanye was running for president they won‚Äôt go out of their way to vote. I‚Äôm Asian and even I know Asian people won‚Äôt vote if it‚Äôs Andrew Yang
[comment]It is the citizen's responsibility to exercise their franchise. If you don't vote[comment]Maybe if they nominated a candidate people actually wanted to vote for this wouldn't be a problem
[comment]44% of eligible voters didn't vote in 2016. Thats about average for every presidential election[comment]Michelle assumed an entire segment of society that shares the burden of (sometimes) hidden discrimination would understand that only a Democrat would protect Obama's legacy.  Trump made it very clear he was anti-Obama and would destroy any legacy left over. John Boehner and Mitch McConnell had made every piece of legislation Obama tried to pass an absolute ordeal. Michele is nothing if not loyal and she saw what her husband went through.  Maybe she assumed everyone would see as clearly.
[comment]Mad because Black voters either A didn‚Äôt want to vote for Hillary or B[comment]Trump voters have serious mental issues and don‚Äôt know any better.
[comment]2016 was tied for 2nd-highest turnout in the last 50 years. Tied with 2004[comment]Or Democrats could try nominating someone who‚Äôs not had 30 years of baggage and right wing vitriol thrown at them
But no[comment]She knows she never had sway with those people.
[comment]You can‚Äôt make voters turn out for an uncharismatic candidate.

We‚Äôre about to find out this same thing we already knew in this election. The only way Joe Biden will win is if Trump somehow makes a fool out of himself to his own supporters[comment]All these people blaming others for the losses. Look to yourself! Did you phone bank? Did the Democrats do enough to reach out to would be voters? The fault is with you not those uninspired to vote for a candidate that failed to create enthusiasm.
[comment]Its about people NOT voting. Not people who voted  for so n so.
[comment]Because she knows how evil the Clinton's were to black people and that's why they didn't vote for her. Michelle Obama is Privileged AF and needs to wake up to this. She should've endorsed Bernie.
[comment]Even her enemies admit that Hillary is a great administrator. And it's time we all admit that Hillary's predictions have been right on the money. None of these problems would be happening if Hillary was President. And the Obama economy would still be chugging along and 70
Of course[comment]Thank üëè You üëè Michelle üëè

I've seen the numbers and the amount of black voters that did not vote is exactly why Trump won.
[comment]NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. 

Hillary‚Äôs campaign was warned numerous times that something bad was happening in the rust belt and they ignored it every time. If they had pushed for turnout in Pennsylvania

[comment]It's a right to vote Michelle there are choices
[comment]Why TF are dems still perplexed as to why people didn't come out to vote for the worst democratic candidate of most voters' lifetimes? Of course nobody came out to vote for Hillary[comment]I have said this multiple times and pissed off many friends: However dumb you think Trump voters are
For me it is just in super simple math terms. Whether you voted Trump or Clinton
Not voting is the equivalent of saying ‚ÄúI cannot tell you if -10 is greater than -1000[comment]Being betrayed by a friend is much worse than being betrayed by an enemy.
[comment]You want politicians to listen to you and pander to you?  Vote!  Doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt like either of them this time. 

First of all stop voting for the charismatic guy. Vote for the smartest guy. Stop voting for ‚Äúslick‚Äù Good on TV assholes.  You don‚Äôt have to work with him
But back to my main point. The next election<|startoftext|>
[title]Joe Biden: "I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag[selftext]https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1256306743585370112[comment]Damn. See how easy that was?
[comment]Trump shirked responsibility again[comment]Not to mention Nazi flags Âçê ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
[comment]Leadership.
[comment]Too bad they're all forms of speech and therefore protected under the first amendment to the Constitution.   

Not that Dems care about that old piece of paper once they're offended or scared...
[comment]Lol. Joe Biden didn't say that. His side maybe wrote that. There is no way that guy could formulate a coherent thought such as this good try. I would like to even see Joe Biden read that on camera without fuxking it up.
[comment]Regardless of ones feelings. I myself care not for the Confederate Flag or Swastikas. However[comment]Fuck Trump and his eighth grade drop out followers.
[comment]It's "funny" how these kind of protests always involve confederate flags and nazi symbols no matter what the purported aim of the protest is.
[comment]Wish his spoken sentences were as coherent
[comment]Sigh. Yeah this dude is way better than the Devil himself
[comment]I think it's funny that one of my favorite genres of music is southern rock[comment]Will he also say that all Americans should have access to free healthcare?

Probably not.

Why get the whole sandwich when you can get the crumbs?
[comment]Biden is actually racist though. Why wouldn't the democrat party want to get rid of him instead of letting him infect the party and ruin public perception of the party?
[comment]I love it[comment]About time he got a voice-SPEAK UP FOR JOE
[comment]Hey mod who deleted my comment. Am I wrong?

[comment]He didn't "say" this he tweeted it.
[comment]Just a heads up
I only mention it because of the Republicans victim-card-spidy-senses get all tingly when you bring up swastikas. Its a perfect opportunity for them to do what they do[comment]Let's start a task force[comment]Does anyone actually believe Biden said that?

[comment]Fuck Trump

# Trumpvirus

# Trumpknew
[comment]Lol....mmmkay
[comment]He did call it a hoax
https://youtu.be/G5TZ6fTYrsE
[comment]Alleging??  If we can‚Äôt even state the black and white truth without weasel words
He will win in November[comment]Lordy I hope there's tapes!
[comment]LOL. Dude DID call it a hoax. Fucking moron. Where is Lee Harvey Oswald when we need him most?
[comment]Fuck Trump
[comment]&gt;alleging

you mean demonstrating?
[comment]This president is a whiney little bitch.
[comment]Sued for what? Truthtelling?
[comment]He always threatens legal action[comment]What a loser this man is.
[comment]He threatens to sue people all the time. So what?
[comment]We need him to take his own Petersen House trip. That's a sentence I never thought I would say[comment]Okay... lets assume he didn't call it a hoax for sake of argument.

Lets put the same legal action on any station that puts his lies on the air.
[comment]OMG! This is so cute! This thing has already gone viral on social media. LOL
[comment]Let him sue[comment]Someone needs to figure out a dumbed down explanation of the Streisand effect to present to him.
[comment]He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.
[comment]Trump is a hoax. Period.
[comment]I say they should go right ahead. I would love to see that hit the courts. There was a little lawsuit called Citizens' United that we all remember.
[comment]Well[comment]All the caterwauling about the 2nd amendment[comment]But he did.
[comment]\#thetrumpvirus
[comment]When you don't have a leg to stand on[comment]Discovery. Simple. Trump is using legal action as a form of intimidation. It‚Äôs the Devin Nunes playbook.
[comment]So[comment]I love how he just calls everything that even remotely threatens his position of power a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù.
[comment]Priorities USA should counter with ‚Äúwe‚Äôll cover all your legal fees if you are sued by the Trump campaign‚Äù.
[comment]SLAPP suits 101[comment]Hey Trump lemme just pull out the world's smallest violin real quick.
[comment]..... he did though
[comment]Please find the audio of him actually saying the virus itself is a hoax.  There is your answer to this headline.
[comment]I swear if they cave under this bullshit threat then they're part of the damn problem. *Everyone* gives in to him. Everyone backs down. 

Paste this link all over the damn internet folks.

https://youtu.be/G5TZ6fTYrsE

And let's be clear here. Fact-checkers
&gt;‚ÄúCoronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it.  We did one of the great jobs. You say
You tell me. *What* exactly is he calling a hoax? The claim he's not doing anything? Because the rest of the ad has all the quotes you need proving *that* interpretation too.

This is bullshit and we have got to stop taking it. If fact-checkers and journalists aren't going to[comment]But he did[comment]How the hell can reality be unfair to Donald j drumpf or any like-minded person when he/they think the alternate reality that they believe in is actual reality.
[comment]Let em sue then use that against them too
[comment]Sure thing
BTW trump is famous for his past bullshit threats of legal action.
[comment]It's plainly established precedent. In the US truth is an absolute defense to libel or slander.

Let him file the suit and lose[comment]So what? Let em let him sue. Roll the tape!
[comment]This is one of those times where you should‚Äôve been more open minded and diplomatic Don. I think those excepts fall under fair use. Not much can be done to stop it from happening.
[comment]Yeah but he did! Like it's crazy that they deny he says stuff that is on video with those words coming out of his mouth. I've heard this before. Yeah he said the "corona virus[comment]‚ÄúThis is their new hoax.‚Äù
-Donald Trump
[comment]How dare they broadcast factual information! Damn liberal media.
[comment]Trump was tweeting some of the meanest crap against Obama when he was fighting a pandemic just for attention and his agenda. If you can't stand the heat[comment]God he is stupid!
[comment]What is this word[comment]The networks need too have some courage for once and keep running the ad. They would have no chance in court with this[comment]Calling Michael Bloomberg - he could nullify this scare tactic in a second by pledging protection for entities threatented by the dictator's campaign.
[comment]HAHAHHAHAHAH
[comment]But those words left his mouth[comment]Last election[comment]He did[comment]The caption to this post uses the term "alleging". WTF? There is no alleging. It's on video.
[comment]Sooo...let him sue?  because he doesn't have a case??  

This is the authoritarian answer yo everything here in the US.  Sue and bankrupt everyone that farts in the wrong direction.  Devin Nunez pulled that shit too.

Let them bankrupt themselves.
[comment]That will be an amazingly easy lawsuit for the TV stations and add creator to win considering he's on tape several times calling it a hoax and a democratic hoax!
[comment]It‚Äôs just a tactic to either get it taken down or neuter it by turning it into a ‚Äúhe said[comment]What is the basis for the legal action?
[comment]Every anti trump ad should just play his lies along with a graphic or video of the actual truth. Every word out of his stinking face hole is a lie so there should be mountains of material to work with.
[comment]But he did say that. It's not defamation if it's the truth. He said it. We have him on video saying it.
[comment]Alleging?

He actually did.
[comment]Does anyone have a link to the ad?
[comment]&gt; However  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúCoronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it
&amp;#x200B;

They could edit the ad and take the hoax part out.  It is still damaging without it given all the other crap he said about it being under control.
[comment]He actually ranted that democrats were criticizing the response and that criticism was purely political and a hoax.  The criticism was dead on!

We should run with this
I'd love to see somebody do an ad or video that shows Dem politicians saying what he should have been doing or was he did wrong and then show his rant over the increasing number of cases.

&gt;**Now  the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that[comment]LMFAO at the cheeto dusted bloviator

[title]Biden Now Leads With Most Senior Demographics ‚Äî Older Americans' Support for Trump Has Collapsed ‚Äî "Let Grandma Die" Proves Unpopular With Grandma
[selftext]https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/[comment]65-75 are considered the most reliable age group to vote. And the most susceptible age group to life-ending coronavirus.

We need to start pushing vote-by-mail as our national standard during a global pandemic. Just in case that second wave hits about that time.
[comment]Boomers only care when it impacts them
[comment]Biden is more popular than Hillary Clinton. I hope it‚Äôs enough to make a difference.
[comment]Ya[comment]Except my grandma... and aunts and parents. I can't make them see the reality of the situation that has been entirely trump's fault.
[comment]ive never voted for a republican and ive lived a long time
[comment]Don't worry. They'll find something for Grandma to be scared of more than them[comment]Love it. If grannies mad at the orange turd[comment]Maybe it‚Äôs because Biden seems older so he‚Äôs more relatable
[comment]Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôs only our entire democracy that‚Äôs on the line after all
[comment]And us the youth who will have to live with this new world after this blows over in a couple YEARS wanted Bernie the one time that the youth the least reliable age group came out in force Biden shows the fuck up and splits the fucking vote. If he loses it‚Äôs fucking over.
[comment]Republicans have always gotten 0% support with this grandpa.
[comment]I'm not sure why but polls don't pick up on the voting preferences of certain lower income republicans. We should ignore all these polls.

[comment]Well we‚Äôre screwed then because I live ( minutes from Iowa[comment]Trump's gambit was that most of the casualties would be in the cities and that they would die in time for election day. We have to be careful and actively prevent that from paying off for him.
[comment]This feels so off[comment]I'll believe it when I see it. Old people have spent the last 40 years believing literally every conspiracy theory that has ever been thought of no matter how inane. All it'll take is one email blast about how Biden is working with the U.N. to put Christians into reeducation camps or some shit. Then grandma will go running back to the GOP.

We must stop whining and outvote the old. Tweets aren't votes. Posts on Reddit aren't votes.

Bernie supporters need to chin up and realize that we‚Äôre not just fighting for the presidency[comment]Glad to see Democrats coming together after a hard fought primary. We may have disagreed on certain issues[comment]I'd vote for one of Biden's turds over Trump
[comment]Everybody still needs to vote for Sanders to maximize his delegate count and power to influence the Democratic party and turn it into something that people can actually get excited to vote for.
[comment]What would you like?  4 years of potential mediocrity with Biden or 4 MORE years of the circus we have right now?  We need to band together folks[comment]Ok Biden supporters[comment]Sanders should be vice president. Just for the simple fact that he has so many behind him.

[title]Mask and all[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/opinions/biden-mask-trump-ghitis/index.html[comment]At this point[comment]The stars aligned for Biden. He is an awful speaker and now all he has to do is put a mask on and let Trump tweet to look presidential.

Trump is going to go out spectacularly[comment]Okay[comment]Don't buy into this narrative. Consider that Trump and his supporters are the exact kind of people who would deliberately LIE to the pollsters just to see false information spread out there.
[comment]The only power we have is to withhold our vote until he takes serious action on climate crisis and Medicare for All.
[comment]You're right! we shouldn't ask for anything from politicians five months before an election!
[comment]No. Organizing and asking for reasonable[comment]Great. Two disgusting old rich white men. 

Again.
[comment]Sorry Biden is going to lose without the left this time unless he moves on Medicare for All and Climate Crisis. All my leftist friends are going to sit this out.
[comment]Trump and his cult can spew whatever bullshit they can but between the RayBans and the black mask Biden looks presidential.
[comment]I'm voting a straight Blue ticket and for any candidate that runs against Trump. 

Not voting in this critical election is not a protest[comment]Currently masks are worn ONLY to stop the spread of Covid-19 not preventing the wearer from getting the virus. I understand both perspectives on this[comment]Not just vote. vote for every Democratic candidate you can in every election everywhere. Anyone in the party that supports trump is morally bankrupt.
[comment]Ninja ~~Gaiden~~ Biden
[comment]Lets run up the score and humiliate Trump. We need to vote in numbers never seen before.  Destroy Trump's brand.

[comment]And Bernie's base has a duty to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
[comment]This is what can turn people away from voting Democrat . Basically says that you should only vote for someone because they have a high chance of beating that other guy not because they agree with him.
[comment]I would vote for Bernie if he gets the nom but I think this article is bunk. The real danger here is that Bernie getting the nom would likely send Wall Street into a frenzy. They have already been trying to stave off an overdue recession<|startoftext|>

[comment]Time to dust off that 2nd amendment and take a stand against tyranny. 

Sadly[comment]Probably no coincidence this was released the same day it was exposed that Yale and Harvard have been hiding foreign money.
[comment]I started r/TheNonsilentMajority after reading this. 

I think there's a space for anyone who has an issue with the escalation of power in the Executive Branch[comment]I really don‚Äôt think it will be close at all. Dems might even win Georgia and Arizona maybe Texas too

[comment]Exactly
[comment]Marsha Blackburn and other ‚ÄúR‚Äù friends are currently blocking bills from being passed that tighten election security.
It‚Äôs obviously working out for them.

[comment]The dumbasses do realize that by removing him from office he may also be arrested and no longer a threat right?
[comment]Fear *and* greed. Not necessarily in that order.
[comment]Trump has probably spent his morning planning on revenge on Romney.
[comment]So the Republican strategy is that they think it looks better to be in fear of the president than to be a sycophantic bootlicker. Well[comment]Typical of tyrannical regimes. Hitler's sycophantic hangers-on were afraid to wake him up to let him know the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy. Same for Stalin when the Nazis had crossed their Western border on the road to Moscow.

The end is near.
[comment]Simply put:

I hope it haunts them for the rest of their lives if he starts doing things that can no longer be excused. Things that actually keep them up at night. Arguably he already is
People dying. Different parts of the government collapsing. The United States itself falling into disrepair. That's all on them.

They knew exactly what sort of shit Trump would immediately do if they let him off the hook for this[comment]I look forward to seeing the reactions when he turns on his party.
[comment]They all have partaken of russian money
[comment]makes no sense. If they convicted and removed him[comment]Makes what Romney did all the more impressive.
[comment]That's why republicns do everything: they are afraid of everything all the time

[comment]Cowards! We're led by cowards.
[comment]No they didn‚Äôt[comment]Marco Rubio literally said Trumps actions meet the bar for impeachment and then says he he won‚Äôt impeach because this is partisan. Not voting what you believe is what is making it partisan.
[comment]Spineless cowards who piss on the constitution because they are afraid of his voters.

[comment]Shit ton of money helps with that.

No retaliation danger.

[comment]You know guys
the House rushed impeachment. They needed to build up the evidence for PR purposes. If you compare how Nixon was removed with how this House moved forward... it‚Äôs like night and day... in 1974 the House voted 410-4 to begin an impeachment inquiry. That‚Äôs not a typo: 410-4!!!!    

US District Court
That‚Äôs what it takes to remove a President and I think we rushed it in case. I just hope it does not backfire.
[comment]What if Trump actually literally goes mad?  He seems sometimes to be on the verge.  And now he's enraged after the impeachment and the Rush Limbaugh scandal[comment]They‚Äôll be too afraid to do anything when Trump decides he‚Äôs going to make himself president for life. Seriously people[comment]Fake news

It turns out the Trump fired the CDC expert on China as well as the pandemic response team.
[comment]This wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Bernie Sanders had been nominated
Go figure!
[comment]Any other functional adult would have handled this better
[comment]Hillary did win[comment]Besides general incompetence and leadership failures on trumps part this country would be ducked regardless maybe to a slightly lesser degree with anyone else in charge.  No sick leave[comment]Maybe we could talk about people who are currently involved in the democratic party and our politics? like i get it
What we need right now is the party to start asking themselves why we're not hearing anything out of Biden right now. Sanders is out there raising money and organizing and Joe is "working 4-5 hrs a day" and "reading memos" 

I'd really like to hear a lot more from him right now[comment]oh hell no this wouldn't have happened if she won but if it did happen it would be nothing like this because she's not a stupid mother fucker[comment]It would have happened. Maybe the response would be different. But the virus would have happened either way. 

It's delusional to believe the virus wouldn't have happened or it would have acted different. The virus doesn't care who the American president is. It's busy infecting the other 6.7 billion people in the world not American.
[comment]The markets would still have crashed and she would lose the next election to some sort of REAL fascist.
[comment]But all those Bernie supporters told me Trump and Hillary were literally the same....
[comment]You know what I tell the morons on the right? I tell them to live in the here and now. Forget about Hillary and move on. This post is stupid.
[comment]Hillary was great and it is a damn shame so many people who should have known better gleefully engaged in demonizing her
[comment]This also wouldn't of happen if Bernie won[comment]It still would have happened. We would have just been prepared better.
[comment]64 million people voted for her

77k in 3 states decided not to.
[comment]Trump did not vote for Iraq War like Hilary.
[comment]I hate trump more than anyone and of course any functioning adult could have done a better job but it‚Äôs unreasonable to say this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Hillary was president.
[comment]Actually[comment]Are we talking about destroying the image of the US presidency through Twitter?
[comment]Pretty sure China itself is the one to blame[comment]Could we have reacted better or sooner ...yes 
But look at how many asshoels are still out there partying and ignoring rules to social distance. The other thing people don‚Äôt consider is how much this would affect the global economy. I believe that really played into how things rolled out. 

Does he lack proper grammar and speaking in full sentences. Yes

Does he contradict himself. Yes

Do people blame him for everything regardless of facts. Yes

Do people continue to share misinformation as facts yes


https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/17/instagram-posts/celebrities-are-sharing-misleading-post-about-trum/

If people could put aside their hate and look at some actually facts we might have a les polarized country. 

The guy does not speak well and is clearly a narcissist but a lot of crap he gets blamed for in just not true. 

Btw the crap the dems are jamming into this bill to pass support is a joke. Make the bill about funding. Ok they can‚Äôt agree. Then just agree to pass something but make the bill say we can change or update this in xxx days if needed. And get that crap passes.
[comment]Your right. We would have been bankrupt a lot sooner.
[comment]Hence why we need to vote for Bernie 2020 :)
[comment]oh please
as someone who doesn‚Äôt like Trump or Hillary
trump obviously shit the bed on this one[comment]He tied to tell you idiots about it in January and even put China on a travel ban. He was then in demoncrap fashion called a racist and the ban was overturned by fascist judges.

It would have happened in some form.

She is a lying corrupt piece of shit too but not on a trump level...he has his own special category.

[comment]Would not trust those numbers from China[comment]China is lying
[comment]This is a stupid graph. Per capital matters
Now
But these graphs are just misleading.
[comment]Is this per capita? If we have 10x the population of a country we are being compared to then this is critical to account for.
[comment]Please read this understanding that these are hypothetical numbers chosen to illustrate a point about graphs and information presentation rather than argue actual infection rates. 

If country #1 has 1
This is the flaw in the graph above. If you don't account for the population you will be led to believe that a 50% infection rate is better than a 0.4% infection rate.

Cmon guys get your head out of your ass.
[comment] Those China numbers are BS.
[comment]We aren‚Äôt testing properly[comment]The mayor of NYC should have told people to stock up on food and social distance rather than go on the subway and go to parades.
[comment]Adjust per capita. The numbers are meaningless otherwise.
[comment]You don't have to report cases if you're killing off your population intentionally. Looking at you[comment]Should probably add up the european countries as a better proxy to compare U.S. to though.
[comment]When can we start saying ‚ÄúThanks[comment]Most are lying (spoiler alert) plus it's cases per million that shed more light
How is it logical to compare USA to any other country when it comes to population as well as overall containment? 

I get the point of the post[comment]Be weary of any numbers from a dictatorship.  Trump "thought" he could blue sky this thing and force people to under-report the enormity and truth if this thing.  China[comment]Doesn't really matter which party you fall behind. The harsh truth is that us has been exposed to be unable to handle any sort of fast spreading virus[comment]I‚Äôm most curious to see what happens in Sweden.

[comment]Aren't the democrats the people who don't want us to have national healthcare[comment]Yeah I'm gonna go with not trusting the China numbers. The entire Chinese bureaucracy is based on fudging numbers and there is no way to get an accurate estimate of their infection rate/death rate. Even if China knew the numbers
Still[comment]COVID-19 data from China should not be allow in r/dataisbeautiful it can‚Äôt be trusted.

https://www.france24.com/en/20200331-stacks-of-urns-in-wuhan-raise-doubts-about-china-s-official-virus-toll
[comment]A few thoughts here:

1. A cumulative graph that isn't normalized is going to necessarily look worse for a large country (China notwithstanding with likely bad data.)
2. This data is 8 days old. A lot has happened since then.
3. Confirmed data is effectively meaningless since there's no consistency globally in testing per capita or even test quality. Chinese tests are notoriously bad
For all the self-hatred we have here in the US
And depending on how you parse the data
[https://www.ft.com/\_\_origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260)

[comment]If you think his campaign treats them like the enemy[comment] &gt;Biden-curious suburbanites

That is some icky phrasing.

[comment]Too late to change that. Too bad.

[comment]Drumph LOL!
[comment]Im getting tired of this performative bullshit.  Nancy Pelosi voted to increase Trumps military budget just a few weeks ago and were worried about how the republicans are going to frame us.  They will never tell the truth about us so we need to organize and start holding them and us accountable.

Also read Chomskys book manufactured consent you fucking libs.
[comment]I didn't watch the speech (proud that I've never watched a Trump speech) but this was an awesome moment.
[comment]Fine - let's start two lists.   One of code violations by current SotH and one list of code violations by current POTUS.    I wonder which one will be longer and/or more egregious?

[comment]Remember that Republican who yelled "You lie!" at President Obama at one of his SOTU speeches?

If Republicans didn't have double standards[comment]I would have burned it right there.
[comment]Let's not forget the "YOU LIE!!!!" Comment. 

In the voice of comic book guy. Worst president ever!!
[comment]She might as well have said ‚ÄúGrab him by the pussy!‚Äù
[comment]I am pretty sure that this was the point of her act as well as letting us Democrats know we still have people as well.  Trump was having a campaign rally and that is not what the SOTU is meant to be.

[comment]Stupid stunts like rippung up the speech RAISES TRUMPS APPROVAL NUMBERS. The Democratic leadership can't help but fuck up EvErYtHiNg! JFC. Serial bunglers.
[comment]What a embarrassment for the Democratic Party.

[comment]What a toxic place to be. This shitty subreddit.
[comment]Our life in Bizzaroworld continues
[comment]They must not follow Trump on Twitter....
[comment]Isn‚Äôt it weird that we measure civility only on the other side? People on the left are just fine with Nancy being disrespectful because he is too but...shouldn‚Äôt in civility be bad all around? We cant come to agreement that that was a petty thing to do? Nobody ever calls out people on their own side

[title]President Trump impeached for abuse of power[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/18/trump-impeached-by-house-for-high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html[comment]Fuck yeah.
[comment]The MF is impeached. Amen. Now the treasonous Republicans will do their worst. Make them pay[comment]"gg ez"
[comment]This is an empty victory at best. Anyone who thinks he‚Äôll actually be removed from office is delusional and I‚Äôve got a bridge to sell them. Also[comment]This wouldn't have happened without all the work that folks put in to winning the House in 2018. Thank you all!
[comment]It will never get through congress :(
[comment]This is historic[comment]Great. Now we vote him out and throw him and his family in jail for decades. #nopardon
[comment]About fucking time.
[comment]SoDoes some other High Crimes etc etc. Can he be impeached again (in 2nd term)?
[comment]Now the question - largely rhetorical - is whether our leaders intend to see this through
Removing Donald Trump from power is not optional if this to be a free country
So
The fact that the impeachment charges don't include Espionage is not encouraging.  

It looks perfunctory.  

For three years
Though I'll never say "too" little or too late.
[comment]This isn't the end of the fight[comment]See y‚Äôall in r/drunk tonight lol
[comment]Its good that we did it but i doubt anything will happen as a result [comment]This is only the first step.

But it feels pretty damn good.
[comment]‚ÄúI‚Äôm not orange[comment]Boo hoo hoo. Cry me a river. What a scumbag trump is. He can go eat a big bag of shit. Exactly what he deserves.
[comment]Press F to dab on the Grave of the GOP
[comment]He‚Äôs not impeached yet
Take a breath and wait for the rest of it to play out. We might not be out of this yet.
[comment]So you all must be so proud. As a Veteran who served in Afghanistan it makes me outraged that Pelosinwould even mention our service when referring to this debochal. I hope you look forward to OUR President Trump for the next term as well.

[comment]Just mind blowing that 42.7% of people think he‚Äôs doing just fine
[comment]We should see a spike again in about 2-3 weeks when the people who caught it this weekend spread spread it through the population w/o even knowing.

[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/4/20/21225016/protests-stay-at-home-orders-trump-conservative-group-michigan[comment]Huh.. That high..  that'd include a lot of tRumpies
[comment]What can you tell us about the 19%?
[comment]Though 100% of the 19% agree with ending immigration during this trying time
[comment]Even my dad thinks these guys are jackasses and he is a hardcore trumper.
[comment]So 19% are MAGA nuts...  I'm surprised there are that many nuts out there[comment]These are obviously small pockets of idiots being organized by right-wing groups that are very likely organized themselves and funded by the groups working to get Trump reelected. This is a very calculated move made to cast a bad light on blue governors[comment]&gt;Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

The idiocy of the jackass holding that sign is painful...
[comment]Haha ‚ÄúGive me liberty or give me Covid 19‚Äù....wow[comment]1/5 of Americans agree with right-wing anti-quarantine mobs. thats terrifying.
[comment]Seems like the rural folks are jealous that the urban folks have all the Covid they want some for themselves. Idiots.
[comment]&gt; Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

That can be arranged.
[comment]19% is 19% more than 3 months ago. At this rate[comment]Disagree is much too gentle. I find these people to be disgusting. They are ignorant[comment]19% of Americans are fucking insane.
[comment]Trump plus Fox News are a fatal combo for these sad folk. But these actions will affect those that are following SIP[comment]If only they couldn‚Äôt spread it to others I‚Äôd say let em die.
[comment]They are just virus vectors.
[comment]They are fake[comment]Fringe nuts. Every country has them unfortunately.
[comment]they're just following their god emperor's commands. I wanna see all 81% of those polled at the ballot box this november.
[comment]The ‚Äúno lives matter‚Äù movement.
[comment]&gt;‚ÄúYou know
Polling around that time put Trump around 38-40% so yeah[comment]Protests you don‚Äôt agree with are mobs now?

Propaganda much?
[comment]But dRump agrees with them and is inciting them to continue. He is directly responsible for the second wave when it comes.
[comment]It seems like there are so many of them cause they are so LOUD. But I think most people with any brain at all get that these people are insane. I even have some hardcore trump supporters in my family who think they are being ridiculous. I am trying to bite my tongue in telling them that is how they all sound when trying to defend that monster.... lol
[comment]If they were only putting themselves in danger I‚Äôd laugh. These people are murderers
[comment]Sadly[comment]815 of Americans disagree with dying[comment]Here's what the "expert" observers are missing: Trump and his conservative backers have to do this because the total self-identified GOP base shrunk since 2016 from 29% to 24%.

In other words
So
The media is still going to sell the horserace[comment]When 81 percent of Americans agree on anything[comment]We should issue protest permits to them but limit it to the covid critical care wards.
[comment]Assuming the ~20% are mostly Trumpy conservatives[comment]Phoenix these idots popped up and like in Colorado nurses showed up to counter protest. It's sad that the very people they rely on for medical care and maybe one day life saving emergency care are the one's they endanger and disrespect. Those same medical professionals will provide the care because its engrained in their DNA to help no matter who or what. Mindblowing
[comment]What about the other 19%. How was the questioned asked because I would be horrified if 19% actually believed in this.

I have not read the article yet but I‚Äôll get to it.

Edit: just read the article and it‚Äôs 19% believed that we need less Social distancing which could just mean a slow economy which I disagree with but is better then these protesters.
[comment]that‚Äôs weird. usually the split between sane people and crazies in this country ends up being roughly 60/40
[comment]Who would have thought?
[comment]Is this really a partisan issue?
[comment]AMERICA: ONLY 19% STUPID! 

JUST GIVE US ANOTHER 236 YEARS! 

WE WILL GET THOSE PEOPLE WISED UP!
[comment]So about 70 million agree?
[comment]Conservatives are hilarious. They'll protest abortion claiming they are saving lives
I don't get it.
[comment]Only 81%?  1 in 5 Americans supports thinks epidemiology is fiction?   

Whoa boy ...
[comment]Christian ISIS? CHRISIS?
[comment]The context of the survey was:

‚Äúshould continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus
The protesters were against the lockdown and not necessarily social distancing.  This is a blatant misinterpretation of the poll.
[comment]If I see these protestors in Albuquerque I'm going to hell shit at them.
[comment]This all illustrates sowing and reaping. The Governors who are opening too early are going to get all sorts of great results for the first three weeks and it is after that that the hospitalizations and deaths will start growing and growing. As in so many other things[comment]Similar to 2008[comment]They show up with guns because it helps make them appear less impotent. There should be no guns allowed at a legally organized rally. It limits those with different opinions. The students at Kent state in Ohio in 1970 didn't have guns. They weren't children like these grown men.
[comment]Boy do I live and work in the wrong place. It feels like I‚Äôm the minority.
[comment]Saw this on Twitter.  From now on they should be called the Flu Klux Klan.
[comment]Despite making up only 19% of the population[comment]The Very Loud[comment]Did you ask every 263 million Americans or is this based on a small sample of left-leaning people. No offense but just curious.
[comment]Fuck every asshole protesting quarantines
[comment]I'm so sad to admit my MIL attended one... Thank goodness for living states away
[comment]I've been reading through both what libs and cons have been saying about these protestsI've seen so many dumbasses give some of the most braindead arguments in favor of the protest. Guess what? Theres a way for you to test the constitutional validity of what you're doing; it's called the fucking supreme court. I really hope that from the next time some dumbfuck starts on this 'freedom to protest' psychobabble[comment]you know how in Iran ppl would be paid to protest and carry Death to America signs and get free lunches so it would look like there was a mass hatred of America?  I think this is the American version of this.
[comment]It‚Äôs not a right wing protest[comment]It saddens me that it‚Äôs only 81%
[comment]im pretty sure there are left-wing people who are also anti-quarantine.  Saying its only right-wing people is just pure propaganda.
[comment]Protest and die[comment]I agree that the number is substantial[comment]All it takes it one positive test and the health department can quarantine all of them.
[comment]That still leaves way too many people.
[comment]There are some Republican Governors and representatives doing an ok job. However they don‚Äôt have the balls to speak against trump and will pander to his rhetoric despite them secretly doing the right things as blue state governors. I am from NC and our governor is a Democrat and he is getting so much shade. I suspect though it is a vocal minority doing this. I live in the RTP and all the Republicans I know agree the state should be shut for now. They say things like we have to reopen eventually but should be shut for now. Nonetheless the mainstream GOP will pander to the organized right wing nut job organizations

[comment]My REAL PRESIDENT talking #truth.
[comment]Now do the 2nd amendment.
[comment]The Republicans sure seem to think it's a privilege.  Or at least want it to be.
[comment]Owning a gun is also a right. Is Hillary saying that every convicted felon in the country should be able to go out and buy a gun?  With no background check?

[comment]Their ideas can't survive contact with reasonable people. 

Treat your ban like the compliment that it is.
[comment]üëçüñêÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è to all my Democratic unknown friends out there in the Reddit world[comment]I actually requested the mods ban me after I got into a good little spat on r/Republican (and they obliged me). It was liberating as I no longer attempt to squeeze any semblance of common sense out of the deplorables by using arguments that they have historically beat everyone else over the head with. TL;DR - congratulations!
[comment]It‚Äôs a cult of personality thing with Trump. It‚Äôs sort of similar with Sanders types. Any dissent is met with extreme vitriol. Fortunately[comment]I mean all it takes is one member of the secret service who actually cares about his country and then Trump will cease to exist
[comment]I'm probably older than you but that doesn't mean anything as far as who someone votes for[comment]Congrats Blue Hero!
[comment]I'm banned from there and conservative too. 

I think one of them I was a bit antagonistic and kind of hostile. 

The other one I genuinely was just trying to get someone to elaborate and explain their view. I wasn't trying to troll and instigate anything. I just wanted understand why they felt the way they did and try to look at their side. 

They just threw out personal attacks at liberals and Democratic politicians and said we're/they're idiots. 

I asked again to explain again without using liberals or Democrats in their explanation and Im now banned.
[comment]you should take a peek over at r/POLITIC

it's basically T_D vs the world with no mods.

[comment]I got permanently banned from r/politics for saying that I'd pay good money to give Junior a good slapping.

Seemed a bit arbitrary[comment]I got banned for quoting Trump **verbatim**[comment]I was banned from a Republican group on Facebook for trying to set them straight.
[comment]Surprisingly I'm not banned despite some wholehearted attempts at it. I like to pop in there every once and a while to remind them that they're ignorant racists and cheerleading polices they jeered at when it was a democrat enacting them.
[comment]The Cons can't be reasoned with.  .
[comment]um we both have the same rules? you just broke them
[comment]I don't understand a lot about Reddit what is n/wordbot or whatever I don't say the n word there's a lot of words I don't say so do I get responses from those bots also for not saying the words that I'm not supposed to or shouldn't say?
[comment]Now I understand how you wrote that post about the propaganda my apologies to you sir[comment]I was banned from politics for telling someone that they are a bad person for supporting Kavanaugh

And from Pete Buttigieg for not thinking we should listen to neo-cons like Jen Rubin about Iraq/Iran

I hope the voter turnout is bigger than ever as well.
[comment]That's great and all[comment]It was a great debate. Glad so many tuned in. 

Klobuacher and Warren were pretty spicy. 

Bloomberg really bombed. He wasn‚Äôt well prepared for the push back and reaction from the other candidates.
[comment]I went in hoping to watch everyone take a collective shit on Bloomberg. I was not disappointed. I was also ecstatic to see Warren finally take that stick out of her ass[comment]Warren‚Äôs campaign should be ecstatic[comment]I watched mostly to see Warren hammer the new york pork dork
[comment]Question from a foreigner: What is the fanfare/anthem played in the introductiom and during breaks? I hear it being played on podcasts about politics too when they are discussing the primaries.
[comment]Any explanation why? 

All the other debates have been steady decreases and lows for Democratic debates
Did this many people tune in for Bloomberg or did they just tune in after hearing a billionaire was getting roasted on national television? 

So interesting

Bloomberg cannot purchase a better reputation so he‚Äôs not really a viable candidate anymore. I really
Klobuchar cannot outflank Buttigieg or Biden[comment]A big part of this was curiosity about the billionaire who had bought his way onstage. And I'm very glad to know that 20 million people watched him be eviscerated by Warren.
[comment]They were all fighting each other. I don‚Äôt think I like any of them if they can‚Äôt stop
[comment]Shout out to Tom Perez[comment]Warren does so well with these things.  She eviscerated Bloomberg rather cleanly.
[comment]Of all the ones to be most watched[comment]It‚Äôs pretty blatantly obvious after watching the ‚Äúreplays‚Äù NBC and MSNBC are posting[comment]Does anyone else find Pete super smug? I want to like him but I just can‚Äôt the more I actually watch him. He speaks eloquently sure but I just find him giving off such smug vibes. Which seems weird because he has such little experience. Is it just me?
[comment]What a disgrace. Warren and Kolbawhatever should take a piss and fuck off. Pete should go back to his village. Bloomberg should learn how to speak. Biden sounds too desperate. 40 years in Government nothing happened. Tell him to go fuck Thomas in the Supreme Court as he was a disgrace in the senate the way he behaved with dr. Hill. Sander should go past fucking sound bites. I am ashamed to be a democratic.
[comment]The networks should be basically only broadcasting these debates on these days. Regularly scheduled programming is halted for the SOTU address[comment]Lies[comment]Why is Bloomberg there?

How did he possibly qualify after joining late and ...No on liking him???

Was he any good? On Colbert he came across as just unnecessary and insincere and weak.
[comment]That‚Äôs great news.  Now[comment]I thought it was really good.  They got out all of the issues on people's mind about each candidate and they debated it.  Hopefully
He is conveniently a republican when it suits him..Bloomberg supported the police department‚Äôs ‚Äústop-and-frisk‚Äù policy that disproportionately targeted minority men.

[comment]That's a non answer lolololol
[comment]Imagine believing that if people don't support you they de facto support Trump... Joe Biden's gross and if we give him the nomination we'll lose the election.

[comment]He didnt mention job.  Let's face it. Some of us are being considered expendable.  My factory is still working building battery test systems.  Grocers gas station attendants and other low wage people who cant afford to voluntarily stay home are being forced to risk themselves and their families with 0 additional compensation. None of us have any hope that we will be remembered when this is done. We are not getting hazard pay and very few companies are offering us anything more than work your shitty job twice as hard for the same pay with more risk.  We cant just go get new jobs. We are stuck and we are being taken advantage of.  While most of the world is relaxing at home we are hurting ourselves for you. It's great that the govs are putting out stimulus checks and paying for up to 90%of companies salaries.  Bailouts for companies who used their cash reserves to buy back stock instead of taking care of its worker.  Every one of us that works at this level understands something a lot of the people making decisions dont seem to get.  They can always replace us.  Always. There will always be someone out there in a worse position. So they will  agree to anything in hope's of taking one more step up. There are plenty of memes saying thank you.  But tbh that doesnt do shit for any of us.  Your thank yous dont pay for my food or rent.  Your thank yous do not get us the ppe we need to stay safe. We keep working while you cry about staying home.. do you have any idea how much we would like to have a 2 week vacation at home?  We are the people least likely to have ever had such time off yet we are the ones being pushed to keep working.  We are looked down on and paid shit every day now all the sudden we are " essential "
[comment]Then support m4a or your words are meaningless.
[comment]I agree.  I saw Sanders say the same many times recently.

But where has joe been? I even heard a rumour he has the virus and is gravely ill.   I would hope if he plans on being president he embraces Medicare for all as this crisis is showing the true cost of care and the division in America the wealth divide creates.

[comment]Are we certain reelecting Trump isn't his goal?
[comment]Bloomberg would love nothing more than 4 more years of Trump. All of these shitty billionaires do. 

Tax the fuck out of them all.
[comment]He's going to get Bernie elected
[comment]Yep[comment]never say never...who really thought the idiot in the white house would win?
[comment]As he is a billionaire[comment]Just vote and get everyone you know to vote too.
[comment]Bloombergs goal isn't to elect Trump[comment]The same could be said if Warren and Sanders. Just don‚Äôt think their policies are what the majority of Americans want. Biden still stands the best chance to defeat Trump[comment]The only spoiler Bloomberg will play is Biden's. He's going to hand the nomination to Sanders or Warren[comment]I think that informing people about Bloomberg's policy positions will actually help Democrats. It would cause disaffected Republicans to vote for Bloomberg. The Democratic party voters have no love for that guy.
[comment]Im pretty sure thats why he entered the election
[comment]Boomerberg running for president just solidifies for me that he prefers Trump over Bernie or Warren because both would make him pay more in taxes.
[comment]I just saw a tv ad for this guy[comment]I hate to be a conspiracy theorist but he was on Anderson's cooper a while back and volunteered he had met with Epstien. Anderson didn't even ask. The presidency is the new get of jail free card.
[comment]I am not a fan of Bloomberg at all[comment]During this next election[comment]This guy needs to stop invoking 9/11 in his obnoxious Youtube ads.  He's acting like Giuliani.

[comment]They're either very low intelligence[comment]Who wants to date someone with the emotional intelligence of a 5 year old?
[comment]trumpism is a damn fine indicator of a serious lack of rationality.
[comment]I find it difficult to not punch them in the face. And 3/4 seems low to me. The 1/4 must be the dumbdems that voted for Biden[comment]I started chatting with one once... second question she asked me was if I supported the orange racist.  Said yes (I don‚Äôt)  

Was some of the most awful hatred I‚Äôd ever seen anyone text.  Just kept pushing to see how much more I could get out of her.  In then end I actually felt bad for her.  Said Obama was the best president ever and told her to have a great day

The absolute horror texts I got after that were hilarious
[comment]Have you spoken to any of them? Can't imagine having to sit through a couple of hours.
[comment]I think women like bad boys[comment]True story: I dated a trump supporter ONCE
I am truly stunned there even exists a 25% that would consider dating these people.
[comment]These are rookie numbers people[comment]Reminds me of the interviews in Behind the Curve documentary about flat earthers where they talk about people dumping them or not going on another date  after finding out they're a flat earther.
[comment]Only three quarters?
[comment]I already get enough racism and xenophobia from my relatives. Don‚Äôt need that shit from a SO.
[comment]One-quarter of single Democrats are truly desperate[comment]And the other quarter think they can fix him or her.
[comment]I mean I‚Äôm sure the feeling is mutual.
[comment]Embarrassingly[comment]Because who would want to date someone who is bigoted and/or ignorant and/or plain stupid and/or uninformed? There‚Äôs a slim chance they‚Äôre uninformed and then you can educate them[comment]Damn right. Can't even picture it.
[comment]Im not attracted to idiots either
[comment]It ends up in unhealthy territory.

You end up feeling like you have to save her.  Or else getting into some dark shit where you're willing to be a slave to her.

The Carver/Matlin thing only exists because neither of them actually believe in anything.
[comment]I don't think I should date at all because physical contact makes me uncomfortable and I like my time to myself too much[comment]I‚Äôd fuck one as hard as I could out of spite lmao
[comment]The real question is what percentage of democrats would date someone that didnt vote in 2016. Cause they lowkey voted for Trump too[comment]Ugh! Ex girlfriend was a republican and thought Nixon was framed and given a raw deal. Why I hung in there for the next 6 months baffles me but breaking up was a little bit easier due to a lack of compatibility.
[comment]I stop talking to them when I find out.
[comment]I was looking at the numbers closely and what stands out is that less than college educated democrats were more likely to date a Republican
Something else that stood out at me is the number of Democrats who would not date a Hillary Clinton voter[comment]Buncha incels
[comment]Very tolerant
[comment]Democrats have morals.
[comment]That‚Äôs embarrassing
[comment]I started dating a trump supporter back in April 2018. We are still together
Not all Trump supporters are beyond help.
[comment]I'm always torn about things like this as I consider turn-about to be fair play.  


I tell myself that we shouldn't expect or extend fair play rules to literal nazis

This situation sucks.
[comment]I‚Äôm a liberal currently dating a trump supporter. Can confirm it is very hard to even mention the current state of the world. Love her dearly though.
[comment]They are between the levels of dumb too batshit crazy. Why would someone sane want that?
[comment]Of course. Total red flag.
[comment]I wanted to say that being a Trump supporter is sorta like being an incel[comment]If this is your biggest concern
I‚Äôm going to go against the flow here[comment]I found out a girl I dated over two decades ago is a Trump supporter and I still felt the need to gargle mouth wash for 30 minutes.
[comment]F
[comment]Martin Luther King
How could you ever date someone who makes such disgusting choices? "Its just a political difference you're bullying us this is as bad as raciiiism"
[comment]I‚Äôm a gay man.  One of my coworkers wanted to set me up with a friend of hers.  She showed me some pics; good-looking guy.  Then she told me he‚Äôs a conservative Republican and I was like ‚Äúno thanks[comment]The other 25% are very drunk.
[comment]You guys do know that there is a massive difference between Trump voters and Trump supporters[comment]I'd be down for one date. Wouldn't mind seeing where we'd go. If he did any moves tho...
[comment]The same democrats who voted biden into the nomination. And don't come with least he's not as bad as trump. It's like offering stage 1 cancer vs stage 3 cancer. Yeah one is worse but its still cancer.
[comment]Dem/progressive women start off calling you an asshole[comment]how relevant
[comment]Why would they want to date an 80-year-old anyway?
[comment]It's called natural selection.
[comment]Why would I date someone so hateful and brainwashed?
[comment]Do you honestly think that a trump supporter would even want to date an opinionated
Really?
[comment]Won‚Äôt DATE?! Hell[comment]My in laws are on the opposite sides of things and they don't talk about politics.

But[comment]Yeah Hot but crazy[comment]I won't even be friends with Trump supporters. I'm cutting ties with all  but the closest family[comment]The other 1/4 are 16 and under. Right? Please?
[comment]Did it once...never again!
[comment]It's hard enough to get along with Trumpified relatives.
[comment]my girlfriend wouldnt[comment]Usually blatant stupidity is a turn off so this is not surprising
[comment]This is why in each and every relationship that makes it past the third date mark[comment]I have disowned Trumpers. I would like to see the stats on that.
[comment]I don‚Äôt hate Republicans[comment]My younger brother voted for Trump. Not because he supported him
I haven't spoken to him in three years.
[comment]That‚Äôs because[comment]20 years ago I was a Republican who dated a Democrat. Haven‚Äôt voted Republican since the 2000 Primary when my girlfriend convinced me that ‚Äúeven Gore‚Äù would better than Bush Jr. 

Sometimes you meet someone hot enough to make you question your values.
[comment]I'd rather have a boil implant at to date a MAGA virus.
[comment]So[comment]But female Trump supporters are easy[comment]I wouldnt...
[comment]Who the fuck pays for this nonsense? Surveys take a lot of time and money and someone thought this was worth both?
[comment]Not surprised
[comment]Sympatric speciation
[comment]If I was single I'd date a Trump supporter.

I've always wondered what it would be like to be the smartest person in the relationship.
[comment]Just being in the vicinity of a tRump supporter is reprehensible.
[comment]My grandma is a democrat an my grandpa is a trump voter but he‚Äôs at least not racist or sexist or homophobic. I bet they have a fun time at the polling booth
[comment]You are essentially saying you'd date someone who is ok being a racist[comment]Hell no üëé
[comment]Dating mentally challenged people seems problematic
[comment]Can't fix stupid[comment]What‚Äôs wrong with the other 25%?
[comment]Especially now[comment]I wouldn't even date someone who didn't fully participate in Democratic Party activities and work on campaigns with me.
[comment]If you have to draw the line at political preference
You should have an open mind that isn‚Äôt based on who they voted for.

[title]Your vote in November will likely decide who Ruth Bader Ginsburg's successor will be on the Supreme Court. If you want that successor to be a progressive[selftext]If DT chooses the next Supreme Court judge[comment]Hold me hostage I love it.
[comment]Support the Senate candidates in contested races as well. Biden can prevent another right wing judge but he can‚Äôt seat any judges without Senate confirmation. 

McConnell has already shown he‚Äôd rather leave those positions vacant than allow any Democratic nominee to be confirmed.
[comment]I do not like biden....but..RBG is the uber important...I will swallow pride and bite my tongue off but no Republicans will get my vote
[comment]No.
[comment]Are democrats calling themselves progressives now?
[comment]The next Supreme Court Justice to be replaced could be could be RBG or Thomas[comment]The Supreme Court has to be secured PERIOD!!!
[comment]I can hear the gun pointed at my head being cocked.
[comment]The Supreme court has been a conservative majority since the 1970s. 

Garland/Gorsuch was the first opportunity in all that time to flip it liberal. 

If Trump gets 4 more years
Having a 6-3 conservative majority
If you want ANY
Vote Biden
Also[comment]Let RBG retire already!!!!
[comment]The DNC/Biden better start finding ways to earn independent/swing votes then. If they can't do this
They need to start figuring out how to appeal to young voters and to Bernie's supporters. Polls are saying that Biden/Trump are tied at 44% of young voters
Also
You can't expect people to vote for your values. People need to find their own values to vote for
You're basically telling these people their main concerns don't matter. Imagine being told that your concern over the SCOTUS doesn't matter because surviving day to day matters more? How would you react to that? We can't guilt or force people to prioritize each other's own personal values. To you
So pitting people against each other saying that this matters more isn't going to work or speak to the voters you need.
[comment]The next president (be that Biden or a second term for Trump) will likely appoint anywhere from 1-4 justices:

* RBG (89* Breyer (81* Thomas (71* Alito (70
If we win the WH and the Senate
If Trump and the GOP maintain power
We can‚Äôt let that happen.
[comment]Biden is extremely electable
I trust them[comment]So[comment]The Supreme Court is already conservative and joe Biden is also a conservative. Who cares[comment]Thank you. I‚Äôve been trying to tell some of the Bernie bro children this[comment]1. RBG needs to survive until Inauguration day
2. Lets hope the Donald doesn't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay or even cancel the general election.
[comment]He isn't the only choice. Biden can step down and a more viable candidate chosen at the convention. A lot of Bernie supporters are independent and Republicans mad at Trump. Biden absolutely can not get any of their votes. Trumps campaign is already bringing up bidens dixiecrat roots.

Democrats kept saying Bernie couldn't build a coalition[comment]Only if we also win the senate.

Otherwise[comment]The DNC is counting on people falling in line with its candidate choice. 

Like our corporate CEOs should be learning right now (but they aren‚Äôt[comment]Wasn‚Äôt Obama‚Äôs pick Merrick Garland... and wasn‚Äôt he conservative? And what about the Anita Hill situation?
[comment]Tried that argument in 2016 when three judges were in play (well done RBG for hanging in there for us) but the Bernie fundamentalists would have nothing of it. I came to the conclusion that most of them wouldn't have voted anyway which was somewhat confirmed in the primaries. All principles no action. 

My take - it's far easier to change from a position of power when you don't have a boot on your neck and a baton beating your balls (or whatever if you don't have them). Unless of course you prefer a bloody revolution and I see zero evidence that more than a tiny handful of Biden refuseniks are into that. You can't have a revolution by just liking social media posts really enthusiastically.
[comment]Biden voted for Scalia
[comment]Should have retired literally anytime between 08-16. Hubris got us in this mess.
[comment]Not without Senate. Not voting for Biden.
[comment]buh Biden needs to EARN muh vote!

nah but seriously Trump will nominate a 55 year old hyper-conservative to replace RBG[comment]No üôè
[comment]Yeah[comment]Ya the Democrats not winning is totalitarianism.

Finding wedges to drive between each other is doing Putin's work for him.
[comment]I don‚Äôt think this is a fair assessment AT ALL. Don‚Äôt get my wrong: Trump is one of the worst if not THE WORST president we‚Äôve ever had. I would never in a million years vote for him and I will be happy when he is out of office. But to say that a war with Iran would be the fault of everyone that voted for him (1) absolves the Trump administration of responsibility and (2) doesn‚Äôt take into account how broken the political system in the US is and why Trump was elected in the first place.

[title]The Nightmare Scenario: Trump Loses in 2020 and Refuses to Concede - Kentucky governor's baseless voter fraud claims have experts worried Trump will do the same.
[selftext]https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nv98/the-nightmare-scenario-trump-loses-in-2020-and-refuses-to-concede[comment]Hopefully he won't make it to 2020
[comment]I can't imagine he will lose in 2020. I will be voting for him even though I am a registered Democrat. The Democratic candidates are weak this time and damn near incompetent.
[comment]Oh[comment]He already said he wouldn‚Äôt accept a losing result  during a debate with Hillary.
[comment]My nightmare is that he is impeached[comment]Ok[comment]The nightmare is him getting reelected.
[comment]he was already refusing to accept defeat in 2016 before he realized that he'd succeeded in stealing the election.  so we need to prepare for 2020 for sure.
[comment]I will certainly admit that Trump is different[comment]I am fully expecting that to happen.

He's gonna call in the people that have been stocking guns to siege Washington. 

We are going to see how patriotic they really are.
[comment]pretty likely scenario we need to prepare for in advance
[comment]Trump is going to prison if he loses. He will do this and more.
[comment]I wouldn't mind voting against him twice. I'm pretty sure he would lose by a wider margin in a second vote.
[comment]Fortunately
That‚Äôs not to say that Faux Nooz and the Trumpies won‚Äôt find a way to make up some bullshit argument about how he won the election even though he lost.

I would think the nightmare scenario would be him winning the popular vote and losing the electoral. Then suddenly he would claim it is time to retroactively invalidate the electoral college. Who knows what this Supreme Court would do with that.
[comment]Handcuffs. That's what will happen. Trump in handcuffs
[comment]He claimed there was voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election.... Spoiler alert[comment]Although this is a very real possibility. I want to believe that considering Republicans in office won't be so caught up in tying themselves to someone who will (almost certainly) have been impeached and lost reelection.

They can make a clean break from Trump and not be held hostage anymore but an impulsive divisive President. What we've seen lately is hitching your wagon to the Trump train is not the best way to win elections. 

I think we know most Republican senators don't like Trump and can see a way out without having to speak out against him. They can talk about how the peaceful transition and elections have consequences.

I'm an optimist and idealist so I tend to believe the best in people so that my.color my views but I'm hopeful.
[comment]He would need to take complete control of the military[comment]Presumes he makes it to the next election. 

The real nightmare scenario is we get to November 2020 and the Republicans have no candidate.
[comment]Hopefully 2020 will be such a bloeout their will be no argument[comment]Concession is not a legal process. It doesn't matter if he doesn't concede. What matters is if he doesn't leave the White House
[comment]There is no basis for believing this would happen. The second the president elect is sworn in[comment]I'd say the real nightmare is Trump winning... But yes
I hope he is defeated by such a huge margin that there's no way for him to go down this path. This should be the goal. Complete annilhation of Trumpism.
[comment]well[comment]Then the next president will have him dragged away. Looking forward to it.
[comment]Like anything else[comment]Won't work. He will squeal as he is dragged to the curb[comment]Who cares if he refuses to concede? Like it or not if he loses he will no longer be president[comment]There's a straightjacket with his name on it if he even tries!
[comment]Russia will see to it that he prevails.  He will once again carry a number of key swing states by relatively small margins.  He will lose the popular vote \[again\] and win the electoral votes and the presidency.  

Russian hackers will once again throw the election in Trump's favor.
[comment]We should pass voter ID laws so he doesn‚Äôt have an excuse
[comment]Secret service will remove him and new president will be sworn in.
[comment]Fuck that notion. If he loses and refuses to call cede
We don‚Äôt let a despot to control the narrative.
[comment]Expect it. Unless it's a landslide victory for us[comment]If all the Democrats in America voted in 2016
GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO VOTE!
[comment]Honestly[comment]&gt;Feaver said Trump‚Äôs rhetoric is at the very least ‚Äúdeeply irresponsible"

That's the understatement of the century.
[comment]A narrow loss guarantees this outcome
[comment]Chaos is Trumps middle name (well that and Donald)
[comment]I have no doubt that when Trump looses that is exactly what he will do.

The bigger question is what will his lackeys do ?

Will they follow him down that rabbit hole or finally grow a spine and honor their oath to uphold the constitution ?

Sticking with Cuomo on this one. If you look at Italy and Spain[comment]I wonder if he says the same thing about fighter jets and bombs???
[comment]Correct[comment]He seems happy to downplay Coronavirus but watch his attitude suddenly change when he cancels the election on health and safety grounds.
[comment]He is retaliating against New York[comment]From the American Conservative[comment]Yet he "orders" GM and Ford on Twitter minutes ago to begin producing ventilators with numerous exclamation marks. Fake president.
[comment]Trump can‚Äôt be a real tyrant unless he manages to kill several thousand at a minimum.

Why hasn‚Äôt anyone in his cabinet told him the most fatalities would be in the Trump voter demographic.
[comment]He does know this all ends with he and his offspring in line to the gallows[comment]Try not to link to FoÂçê News.

This puppet dictator's bullshit is pretty standard at this point.
[comment]He just tweeted in all caps that ford needs to open a plant in Ohio and make ventilators...

It‚Äôs almost like crazy people have a hard time making up their minds.
[comment]Why is this petulant child still president? Seriously
The 25th amendment has been talked about to death
Under the amendment's fourth stipulation
Section IV reads:
"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide

He should be held criminally liable for spreading misinformation and endangering people.
[comment]Dr. Trump
[comment]He didn‚Äôt believe positives would go up. Lie after lie[comment]Right[comment]He canceled the deal with GM today to make them.  Fuck him. He should be charged with manslaughter.

Trump cries that Obama needs Congressional approval before air strikes.
[comment]Shut the fuck up. Nobody cares about congressional approval.

We just started a war by assassinating a top general. With or without congressional approval[comment]Isn‚Äôt this the distraction Trump wants[comment]Fuck Trump.
[comment]I‚Äôm afraid this isn‚Äôt going to be regional at all. As a result of this strike there will be attacks in the US.
[comment]I'll go out on a limb and predict that Trump properties will be early targets of retaliation.
[comment]Trump knew what he was doing. That's why he didn't tell Congress:

"A war between the United States and Iran would be a disaster. Even worse than the disaster after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Neither side can reasonably be interested in a military conflict. And yet both are currently in the process of escalating the conflict."  6 months ago during Strait of Hormuz escalation

[comment]Didn‚Äôt they say the Generals were going to stop Trump from doing something like this because they wouldn‚Äôt follow an illegal order? Isn‚Äôt assassination illegal?
[comment]Don't forget when we secured the Baghdad airport and risked lives to do so? Now its so unsecure that Iran Generals use it to attack us? You can't look at this as just an attack[comment]Not only is a war convenient for Trump. One talking point I haven't heard talked about though relates to Trump/Republicans' BFF in the middle East. A particular guy/country who has a vested interest in killing Soleimani and potentially crippling Iran[comment]Congress should cut off all funding to the military.
[comment]Does anyone know[comment]And we are all still waiting ( after reading posts ) for some entity of authority within our government to actually enforce the law.
And[comment]You need to get Congress permission to declare war. And the guy was a terrorist. I‚Äôm not mourning his death and there are a lot of Iran People who are happy he is dead. So no this is not declaration of war so he did not need congress.

This is a junk article[comment]But of course[comment]No shit. Why else would he keep putting Russia ahead of the US and our allies?

It doesn't take a genius. It takes a person not controlled by propaganda.
[comment]Let‚Äôs all act surprised üòÆ
[comment]Wait until it is corroborated. Until then[comment]His two "boys" already said they got all those money from Russia.

The son of supreme Court Justice Kennedy was the banker.

I've always felt he retired due to pressure.
[comment]I am shocked! Shocked I say! 

Seriously
Elect a clown expect a circus.
[comment]This is old news.
[comment]Might explain the [Deutche bank exec suicide](https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/deutsche-bank-death/).
[comment]This is why Trump distracted everyone with the assassination.

There's proof that he's compromised.

So he wagged the dog.
[comment]No puppet
[comment]And most world banks are backed by China.  ...soooo.
[comment]Is this the impeached and disgraced President Trump being referenced in the report?
[comment]This is like the second or third explosive report as of late. 

So many explosions. 

Is everyone ok?
[comment]Not really explosive in the sense that Russia in some way incentivized lending to Trump who in turn laundered Russian money. Probably did more than that tbh.

 But the new piece to the puzzle was the incentive to DB was a guarantee from VTB? Or was the news the fact that a guarantee from VTB was the equivalent of a guarantee from Putin? 

I keep saying[comment]Shocked that Russian money kept him afloat. Shocked I tell you

[comment]That alone makes Bloomberg OK.

Of course NOBODY is good enough for the Bernie / AOC crowd.
[comment]Considering the amount of money Bloomberg spends on his ads... I don't think you can say that he is in Trump's head "rent-free. "

Added:. Nancy pelosi however[comment]Who fucking cares! What does he plan to do for people‚Äôs lives?!

[comment]I kind of appreciate having Biden &amp; Bloomberg to soak up attacks from the right that would otherwise be focused on our actual nominee.

You can tell they are from their expression as if they have a bottle of hand sanitiser waiting after shaking hands with their Democrat supporters.

They always look bored as if they would just "phone it in". No genuine smiles
Seriously I don't trust them.

Infiltrate. Disseminate. Eliminate. That's the Republican method; sway the states
They're wingers for the other side.
[comment]I really don't want Trump Stresianding Bloomberg into a contender though.

&gt;the cellular movement feels emboldened¬†by the Trump presidency  

What does the "cellular" movement refer to?  Or is that a typo maybe?
[comment]They were all asking to be excused to go to the restroom when the picture was snapped[comment]So the entire training program looks to be just one month

[comment]Good riddance[comment]And these are the dumb asses that got caught. Imagine the ones that already made it on to the force.
[comment]Why are their faces blurred out? Its a public photo[comment]Good on that governor.
[comment]Firing them was absolutely the right thing to do.

My only question is why the newspaper is pixelating their faces.¬†  This is an official class photo they posed for and knew could be  displayed.¬† Show us their faces and let this follow them around when  they are seeking future employment.¬† I'd hate to think these people  could go out and apply for other corrections or law enforcement work and  potentially be trained and hired because they left this off their  resume.¬† No one who does something like this should ever be in position  where they carry a gun[comment]Good.
[comment]The comments section has been essentially hijacked by people who rather talk about the Stanford  experiment
which has absolutely no bearing AT ALL regarding the photo OR the West Virginia Correctional Officer class
or the fact that they have been correctly fired after casually
No one is offering the phony argument that the symbol began as a prank on 4chan to "own the libs"
which is fine; in reality since real White Supremacists and real racist mass murderers have been photographed
and caught on video

So
Probably NOT; SOME are
but some of them very likely just followed along
Were ANY of them making cognizant
NO.  Absolutely NOT.  

They deserved to be fired for this[comment]Democrats are responsible for the police state a prison industrial complex also.  Stop trying to appeal to the non-existent center and get on the right side of history.

But this isn't genocide and it's irresponsible to try to say it is. Genocide is a systematic intentional action to remove a specific group from existence. Genocide is 8

Trump is criminally negligent[comment]I really hope Trump lives long enough to see what a fool history will show him to be. Corona virus will be in every history book. History will not be kind to Trump.
[comment]"Netizens"[comment]I'd call it gross incompetence[comment]What happened to the Jews is a Genocide. Rwanda[comment]I think the descendants of Armenians who‚Äôve been systemically killed by the Turks 100+ years would beg to differ.
[comment]Definitely not genocide. That‚Äôs not what happened[comment]We as Americans let that man be in office
[comment]This is a bullshit source stating an exaggerated version of the obvious to both increase its own status and discredit us.

Republicans kill lots of people by deliberate sabotage[comment]lol this OP literally doesn't understand the word "genocide"
[comment]Well[comment]People love throwing big words around. As much as I despise trump he is just irresponsible and not fit to be president.
[comment]I get that trump has had a terrible response[comment]Genocide? That‚Äôs not the right word. Gross negligence is one of the words. It could be in the territory of some form of manslaughter although I only saw one (üôè) of those press conferences and that is the one where he said‚Äùwhat have you got to lose‚Äù.

[title]Discussion Thread of tonight NBC Democratic Debate
[selftext]Democrats currently debating on NBC. Please discuss your reactions and opinions. If someone could give a link to stream or other sources to watch it[comment]My God Bloomberg is so out of touch... I haven't followed him at all except the occasional Reddit comment and meme. 

He's running satirically right? Like he's gonna reveal in a month that it's all been an act? He's trying to teach voters that Donald trump can happen to the left? And we need to be careful?

I really thought it was hyperbole calling him the lefts Donald trump. You can feel the audience holding back boos when he was talking about his tax returns. My God.
[comment]Not a single viable candidate.
[comment]I like Biden. He's definitely not my favorite candidate[comment]Is it just me.. or does it feel nearly IMPOSSIBLE to watch the democratic debates at your own pace??

I was at work when the debate started. Finding it impossible to watch from the beginning. Hell
This public information should be much much easier to find for voters. I feel like every single debate has been unnecessarily difficult to find. 

Can't rewatch it without some pundit's take or chopped up "highlight reel". 

Please someone correct me if I am wrong :-( but I have been pulling my hair out this year just trying to be informed.. and that feels so so wrong.

(sorry to rant).
[comment]I think Warren is taking a lead tonight. Good for her
[comment]This was a rough debate to watch. I think it will get more palatable once we narrow down the field. I didn‚Äôt get the presidential vibes from any candidate tonight but then again the bar has been set the lowest in our history as a nation.
[comment]I like them raising their hands like 2nd graders. Make me laugh.
[comment]chuck todd is trash
[comment]The great state of Georgia muted part of the debate 

https://youtu.be/jcPM8Oq90-E
[comment]What was that outburst ealier
[comment]Do we think any of the candidates on that stage would tab one of the others as their running mate when all is said and done? I‚Äôm having trouble thinking of a logical pairing.
[comment]Does anyone else wish these debates actually involved civil discourse instead of what feels like reality tv drama? I feel like they have to act that way because of the way the debate is structured[comment]You all saw strategy being worked tonight. Warren is in the 10-12% range and sees Bloomberg sitting at 19% (simply by spending). She went big game hunting tonight to try and pry some of that 19% into her camp. She likely succeeded
Biden seems to be comfortable just ploughing along on his record as though anyone cares what he did 20+ years ago vs. what he'll do in 2021. 

Bernie is ... well
Bottom line: tonight was about Warren and Mayor Pete trying to make this a smaller race by pulling a "This is Sparta!" to Bloomberg and Amy.
[comment]Disappointed at the lack of talk on policy[comment]Bloomberg actually did alright
[comment]Am I crazy or is Bloomberg making a lot of sense to me? I mean initially didn‚Äôt look good when he got hanged up on but afterwards I‚Äôm really liking him. Also liking Amy Klobuchar

[comment]Damn that's not even close.
[comment]I fucking hope
[comment]Aren't most of DJTs paths to victory in 2020 reliant on keeping AZ? This trend coupled with Florida having turned into a legitimate question mark for the president puts the onus back on the three Midwest states from 2016 where he won by less than a single percentage point each.  :) 

Maybe he should have tried expanding his base a little instead of spending the last three years just giving the middle finger to the 62 percent of the country that DIDN'T vote for him.

GOTV
[comment]Yeah[comment]How could mark Kelly lead that big. When he's not even been campaigning?
Does Arizona really hate Martha mcsally/Trump that much?
[comment]Arizonan here.  We must NOT become complacent.  We must turn out in record numbers and vote for Mark as if he was 5 points behind.

It's fine if the votes aren't there to pass the bills. That's how it goes. But to table legislation voted on and passed is a violation of his oath of office.

[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-livid-after-california-allows-statewide-mail-in-voting-these-votes-must-not-count[comment]Cuz Trump and most republicans would lose their seats if mail in voting was country wide
[comment]Kiss my fucking ass Trump.
[comment]Trump votes by mail himself.
[comment]He told everyone that republicans would never be elected of voting was easier[comment]Last election he claimed there were 3 million fantasy undocumented immigrants being bussed all over the place to vote in person[comment]No[comment]I wonder if he realizes that Pennsylvania passed election law reforms[comment]Let‚Äôs have the vote shoved up your ass.
[comment]The president of the United States is saying that the votes of some citizens must not count. This is getting normalized.
[comment]Good thing states run their own elections
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]Like it matters for him in California anyway[comment]Trump Jail 2020!
[comment]*Absentee* votes.  Don't let them control terminology.  People know and are comfortable with absentee ballots and thats all this is.
[comment]Trump and the GOP seem intent on testing the ['4 Boxes' theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_boxes_of_liberty).
[comment]All the states rights Republicans are really going to give it to him for meddling in state elections and... Oh right.
[comment]The US military mostly votes by mail.  I guess their votes don't count?
[comment]So does that mean in Trump's weird world that states that have mail in voting[comment]Absentee ballots have been a thing since the US Civil War.  The US military votes by mail.  Is he going to disenfranchise active military from voting?

Trump only opposes mail in ballots because Republican strategists told him too many voters is bad for him.  The only fraud is Republicans trying to suppress the vote.
[comment]Oregon has voted by mail for years. Is he all the sudden going to say our votes don‚Äôt count either?
[comment]He should really just shut the fuck up. The states decide how they hold elections
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder
[comment]He's rather transparently and poorly laying out the ground work to dispute the election if it doesn't turn out in his favour.
[comment]Wow they really should have the President take an oath or something to uphold the Constitution and let everyone do conditionally protected things like vote.

Oh wait...
[comment]&gt;‚ÄòThese Votes Must Not Count‚Äô

Seems like a declaration of war on America to me.
[comment]Our president hates people voting. Lol
[comment]There should be an ad that basically paints Trump as someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in democracy[comment]Is he really gonna try to say he‚Äôs win California otherwise ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
[comment]Trump can suck my Washingtonian balls. We vote by mail here and our votes do and will forever count. No reason every state in the union couldn't do the same.
[comment]Statistically speaking[comment]How is this not impeachable?  Oh right republicans are anti American cockroaches and tyrants who want to suppress anyone who doesn‚Äôt kiss their ass.
[comment]The point is that the Republicans know that the minority of Voters who do support Trump support him enthusiastically and will jump through any Hoops to vote for him. Therefore if you make voting as difficult as possible
In my opinion the reason he has such a enthusiastic following among the ignorant is a direct response to the election of a black president and many white people feeling that this threatens their prerogatives and privileges.
[comment]My wife and i have been voting by mail for the last 5 years. Military personnel vote by mail.
[comment]Voting is so undemocratic.
[comment]If not for the Cal Supreme Court ruling against the requirement Trump wouldn't have been able to be on the ballot because he won't disclose his taxes.

This is going to be the dirtiest[comment]Seriously what is the big deal?  Does he not want every American‚Äôs vote to count?
[comment]People should be allowed to go to the polls if they want. Although the military and Americans abroad mail in their votes[comment]Maybe if the GOP has popular policies then more votes would go to them... the problem is not the voters. The problem is policies.
[comment]Wait till he finds out about Arizona. üòÜ
[comment]And notably[comment]Says the man who mails in his vote
[comment]I am not particularly well versed in politics and I am honestly confused. What is with people being against mail-in ballots?
[comment]This just shows you if you haven't already known that this guy is so fucked up in the head I mean he really thinks he can win California. Donald j drumpf is losing his fucking mind and the right-wing followers of this dear leader I guess aren't smart enough to realize it[comment]Does he know that Oregon votes entirely by mail?

[comment]You did good Andrew!  Keep involved in politics.  Your ideas need you to champion them!
[comment]I liked a lot of his novel ideas[comment]He had some good ideas. Hopefully he stays in politics.
[comment]But he's the most popular candidate as decided by Reddit. /s
[comment]One of the few people running I respect
[comment]Girl bye
[comment]That dude was brutally honest about it. I respect that.
[comment]He was never gonna go far in this run[comment]And that was the nicest article CNN has ever written about him.

Hope we get a good endorsement soon.
[comment]See ya in 2024 bro.
[comment]Thank you for running an amazing campaign Yang!
[comment]I was hoping he would gain some momentum as his ideas are fantastic.
[comment]What  a shame for yang to drop
[comment]The yang gang got gang banged.  Run for Senate!
[comment]It wasn‚Äôt his time yet[comment]hopefully there are other offices he can run for and add some experience.
[comment]I'll miss his campaign slogan.
[comment]Yang's ideas[comment]Wonder if Bernie gets a bump
[comment]I think yang should run for mayor of a major city (preferably NY for the exposure on UBI or Detroit to help turn around an area most affected by automation) and show off what his plans can do there. That way he can get some valuable experience and he can give the most extensive demonstration of his UBI plan yet.

I think he would be an okay senator or house member as well[comment]Hopefully he is back in 2024 when more people know his name
[comment]I'll keep my yang sign parked right next to the BERNIE sign in my front yard.
[comment]UBI will eventually be a thing[comment]Yang needs to run in the House or Senate.  We need Dems in Congress.
[comment]Yang‚Äôs campaign was too intellectual for this country and reading many of these comments proves that. It‚Äôs not that people are dumb and can not understand what he was saying because thinking that would contradict everything he stands for - but people aren‚Äôt used to a candidate who so deeply cares about fundamentally changing the way this country operates from how we measure economic success to how we engage with local communities to how we understand mental health and much much more. Yang stood for a better tomorrow and be believed in that. He has now fundamentally changed political rhetoric in this country and reopened the political sphere to normal Americans. It was hard to say goodbye but he really did shake things up and I‚Äôm so grateful for that. 

We NEED more people like Yang in this country and I hope he finds a way to stay acutely involved (cmon Bernie - you know what to do). 

Bernie bro in 2016 and I‚Äôm ready to return to his cause but never will I forget how an Asian man who likes math inspired me to think harder and want a truly happy country. Yang brought new ideas to the table - let‚Äôs not let them go too quickly.
[comment]He wasn't a bad guy and had he succeeded[comment]Best candidate in the race by far. It‚Äôs a sad day.
[comment]What an idiot people were just starting to talk about him.      God the DFL has some lame fucking candidates.

[comment]*Full text if paywalled for you; written by Fintan O‚ÄôToole*:

Over more than two centuries
However bad things are for most other rich democracies
Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming
As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic
It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster
The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisisdemonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge
If the plague is a test
Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil
It is hard to remember now but
What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump ‚Äì he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility
Thus
In Florida
Georgia governor Brian Kemp
This is not mere ignorance ‚Äì it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is
It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories
Trump embodies and enacts this mindset
The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump‚Äôs statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has ‚Äútotal authority‚Äù
But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump‚Äôs presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in order to do as they like with the environment
Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself
And the president
That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US ‚Äì it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening
And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017
As things get worse
Either way[comment]I'm a single issue voter....

Donald Trump's philosophy is

If at first you don't succeed
Lie
Everybody lies
And
Why do people keep forgetting this.

When you tell a lie you insult the intelligence of the person you are lying to and you destroy your own credibility.

**When Donald Trump lies he destroys America's credibility
**AND HE INSULTS THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOU
as they are the only ones who still believe what he says.

[title]Anti-Trump conservative group[selftext]https://www.newsweek.com/anti-trump-conservative-group-led-george-conway-rick-wilson-endorses-joe-biden-1496968[comment]Cross-aisle[comment]My hope is that this group does real damage to Trump over time.  I think most people can agree that 1) adults need to be in charge of the country; and 2) a good faith opposition party is good for democracy overall.  Trump and Trumpism need to be destroyed in order for those to happen.  It's useful to have Republican operatives as allies who are well-versed in the "dark arts."

He's not a real conservative.
[comment]Yeah no shit they endorsed Joe Biden[comment]Biden is going to lose badly. The DNC does it again. What a fucking joke.

[comment]What if they passed some sort of executive order extending his term? it appears executive orders can override the Constitution so....
[comment]That is going to be a very nervous few weeks
[comment]On January 21st Trump will be just an ex-President without power no matter what he wants. The only way for him to stay in office would be to change the Constitution or overthrow the government. If he were to throw a tantrum and refuse to leave he would be escorted out by the Sargent of arms. He‚Äôll have as much right to sit in the Oval Office as you or I unless one of us is elected President.
[comment]He could refuse to leave office.
[comment]Trump will just appoint himself "Acting President" like he has done to skirt every other position.
[comment]You can rely on the fact that he will definitely try. Let's not rule out the right-wing SCOTUS Judges getting involved on his behalf either before or after the election.

Edit: Spelling and grammar

[comment]Promise?
[comment]marketwatch trying to jinx us
[comment]When people say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get complacent and don‚Äôt trust the polls‚Äù - correct them by saying:

‚ÄúRun up the score on the gop.  Vote your ass off!‚Äù - it uses positivity and optimism as the catalyst to vote and look forward vs. using fear.
[comment]Do not get complacent!
[comment]OH and NC[comment][This](https://www.270towin.com/maps/0mjkZ)is my prediction as of now.
[comment]Look realistically he lost by over three million votes last time and still here we are. So nobody get any kind of hope until 2024 and even then he's probably going to win again
[comment]Ignore this[comment]VOTE and make sure your friends do too.
[comment]That would explain why the Democrat states are against opening up "and I thought it was because they were saving lives". 
The economy will thrive and you all know it.
[comment]In normal times with a candidate who could tie his own shoes maybe.
[comment]I really hope this ages well
[comment]Sad that he doesn't face historic defeat irrespective of the economy[comment]Doesn't matter. Campaign and vote as if we were 5 points down in every state.
[comment]This is not an accurate interpretation. They are looking at these number and drawing conclusions based on the unemployment rate and other economic statistics[comment]If Trump loses we will not know whether he truly lost until December 14 when the electoral votes in each state have to be certified. Trump being Trump he will sue the heck out of the states[comment]PA isn't flipping
Covid is certainly not damaging Repubs here. They let the problem get so bad it takes drastic political action just to sort of flatten the curve and then blame it on "government" and people eat it up[comment]God I hope it‚Äôs right. I just remember the trauma of 2016 when all the polls showed Hilary was ahead and then afterwards I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed.

[comment]I don't see how Arizona doesn't flip blue. "Let old people die to save the economy" isn't real popular with all the old people here. Also Kelly should crush Mcsally.
[comment]Didn‚Äôt we get complacent in 2016
Trump only faces defeat if we VOTE. Polling does nothing but give people false hope that we‚Äôve won. PLEASE VOTE AND DON‚ÄôT BE COMPLACENT.

Biden needs to beat Trump electorally.  In 2016
[Trump Leads Biden in the States He Won in 2016: Campaign Update] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/biden-urges-protesters-to-harness-their-rage-campaign-update?srnd=premium&amp;sref=YjKZ1f32)

Biden needs to beat Trump overwhelmingly to show Republicans that this country wants none of the Republican bullshit.
[comment]Bull$hit. Anyone remember this?  [Hillary has a 93% chance of winning](https://i.imgur.com/gaQLSFW.jpg)
[comment]We need to beat trump in a landslide. Everyone has to vote. If we only beat him by anything less than 10% they will attempt to invalidate the election and start a civil war. Everyone in every town across America needs to vote against him and all republicans. Only then will we find peace.
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.

Keep fighting until January 20[comment]All he has to do is smile and not say anything and he should win.
[comment]Just thought I‚Äôd remind you guys that Hillary was supposed to have the same sort of lead in the polls
[comment]Only if we vote for him! Go Joe!
[comment]This is still way to low. Its actually fucking depressing.
[comment]It don‚Äôt matter if we don‚Äôt vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.
[comment]I don‚Äôt care. VOTE
[comment]Let's wirk harder to a point that Biden be 80%ahead of TRUMP...let's not make same mistake of 2016
[comment]Polls don't matter. Vote
[comment]That lead aint big enough
[comment]Not good enough. Run up the score. Lets beat him by 20 points and humiliate the fuck out of Trump.
[comment]I'm not very enthusiastic about voting for Biden (seems like a nice guy just super out of touch) but I will. Same as I did for Hillary. I really wish the Democratic party could come up with better candidates.
[comment]Trump isn't even trying to be a real President[comment]This isn't just about Republicans either[comment]Got to keep it up! Have to spot Trump at least 5 points[comment]Trump's not completely stupid -- he's trying to start a civil war because it's basically his only chance. Barr's going to help him round up his enemies[comment]Don't get cocky folks[comment]And yet[comment]Remember when Hillary had a 20-point lead. These polls are jokes
[comment]We must VOTE to make this happen! Believe no polls. And it has to be a landslide so that Trump cannot refuse to leave OUR White House.
[comment]Compared to 2 points two months ago. Holy shit
[comment]I would like a moratorium on all posts about Biden being ahead. If every single one of our blue asses doesn't turn up in November[comment]Obligatory and unnecessary: "don't be complacent" and "I hate polls like this. We have to get busy"
[comment]Remember nov 2016 and the distortion that could be caused by electoral college system. It is not popular vote based election and Russian government is helping him. 
Don‚Äôt be overly confident on this.
[comment]DONT TRUST THE POLLS! REMEMBER 2016? PLEASE VOTE!
[comment]More importantly a poll came out with Biden up +6 in Michigan.
[comment]Polls don't mean shit.
Except the one taken on November 3rd.
[comment]Didn't hillary have more than a ten point lead at times prior to the 2016 election??

Fuck these polls.

Vote.
[comment]Keep him hidden and don't let him talk. We need to remove Trump[comment]Just VOTE! PLEASE!! I don't want to see the US turn into an authoritarian dictatorship.
[comment]Let‚Äôs not get cocky!
[comment]Biden will gain some ground the next few months albeit slowly.  Luckily we get to replace one asshole with another - yet a lesser asshole.
[comment]I remember when Hillary couldn't lose.

I give to Joe's campaign EVERY WEEK because I know this will be a hard fight all the way to the end and maybe even after.

There's a reason Trump had Rudy Giuliani do what he did in the Ukraine: he didn't want to face Joe Biden in the Fall.  Getting Biden out of the way was the goal that made him impeachable.  

Because it always goes back to Donald Trump.
[comment]With the amount of love Wall Street had for HRC and Bill I think they are not the savior that we had hoped for. The reality is no political party is in a position to deal with this. The closest thing would be what this party calls a revolution that no one wants. 

A question that I felt like they missed in the debate and the thing Biden keeps talking about when asked about Yang (not the MATH). He says Yang has a vision for the next industrial revolution and it is upon us. That should maybe be the focus. I know we fear that airlines going BK is bad. Instead of infusing money into the corporations that are profit over people we should maybe hear what Yang is thinking is coming

[comment]The irony is that after all the years of being demonized by GOP she emerges as a central force in guiding the investigation in to abuse of presidential power.

But the president is just the tip of the iceberg - the figurehead - of a greater problem. We have the president we have because of a failure of the GOP to provide any other alternative. If for no other reason than by omission the party allowed Trump to be the standard bearer for the party. But in reality he is just a red herring
Time for a change.

[comment]Winning the war of public opinion is very important however. Republicans prove this with their endless smear campaigns and frankly Democrats need to fight fire with fire more often.

[comment]I mean it's also the purity tests. Warren supporters hold every other candidate to impossible standards while deriding everything they don't like about their candidate as an unfair attack. Her cultish populism scares me.

[comment]Yeah[comment]It‚Äôs not activism
Some people/institutions should absolutely get roasted all the time in every context imaginable.
[comment]but[comment]The Twitter verse simply needs to be ignored.
[comment]Then publicly shaming them in real life isn't activism either. But that's what protests are and you can literally do both.

Because that's how free speech works.

It does count as activism[comment]No shit. Young progressive twitter‚Äôs ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is beyond stupid and the most any of them will ever do for political activism.

Gabbard is human trash. The Indian party- BJP- that supports her lost again in New Delhi today because they‚Äôre xenophobic farright sycophants.

Am I missing something?

[comment]What ‚Äî legislators did something sensible? I think I finally landed in a universe I can enjoy!
[comment]My mother belongs on /r/insanepeoplefacebook. She said this is a precursor to the left coming to take all of our guns away.

She's a midwesterner who has transplanted to florida and is semi-retired. She lives in a boomer echo chamber where any mention of removing statues or removing public adoration for the confederacy is somehow the left planning a takeover and indoctrination. It's downright looney.

I got tagged in one of these where she was all "see"? 

I typed in a public post that both Obama and Clinton each had 8 years to take our guns and couldn't even get that done. Gosh[comment]I have a feeling this could enrage Republicans and turn state red again OR (if enough people vote) state could be blue for a long time.
[comment]Yup yup. Yup. Hopefully passed before 2020
[comment]Good.  Election Day should be a day off nationwide.
[comment]Well good for Virginia!!! Now can the rest of the country do the same for election day?!?!
[comment]Its unfortunate that people such as myself still won't get this holiday off work. But this is a huge step in the right direction.

Is/Was Lee-Jackson Day a day people get off work in Virginia? I didn't think so. 

I don't predict this is going to make too many people angry except maybe in rural areas? Now[comment]Robert E Lee is a goddamn hero. He could not bring himself to fight against his homestate of Virginia.

The Civil War was fought over slavery

There is no record of any Confederate general protesting that illegal order. Lee never tried to stop his men from murdering blacks they caught.

Robert E Lee and Stonewall jackson are war criminals. That's your heritage.

[comment]Unfortunately there are millions either part of the Trump cult or millions who can't admit they were wrong.  We will never change them.  We  just have to GOTV for the Democratic candidate on Tuesday[comment]Trump is Palpatine and Bernie is Yoda.  That makes Pence a cardboard cutout of Vader.
[comment]I don't agree that we should just permanently cancel every Trump voter. Winning the general and making progress is important
If we were going to blame people we shouldn't blame people for voting wrong
But we shouldn't blame people at all[comment]At least 3 million Americans would heartily agree üßî
[comment]DAMN RIGHT!!!!!  DAMN STRAIGHT!!!!!
[comment]Knee jerk progressive disagrees.
[comment]So now "better than Trump" is a talking point. Diaper rash is better than Trump.
[comment]I could never figure out that line especially from democrats.  It had everything to do with stacking the courts.  By not voting Clinton they basically allowed trump to destroy the courts for the next 30 years.
[comment]Just a reminder: If you think either "side" of your government has your/the peoples best interests at heart[comment]Hillary isn't perfect
Hillary knows that as long as you're passing laws people want and that help them

Saying that if you think ‚Äúthis‚Äù then you‚Äôre a moron to whom no one should listen about anything ever again[comment]Well. Yea. But it seems that we are the only people who are awake to this idea. The entire Republican Party seems to be entirely brainwashed. It‚Äôs actually truly sad.

[comment]Media: Oh look at the 42 things Trump has done
Also media: Wow no idea why everyone downplayed the guy?! 

It's like putting toy commercials on cartoons it seems and wondering why the children pick that certain toy that they see over and over and over again.
[comment]Most of the mainstream media didn't turn her into a caricature. That was the conservative pundits[comment]I agree with one statement. She definitely hasn't changed.
[comment]The mass media are controlled by the consumers
How do you get accurate information?  Use multiple sources and pick those that are not slaves to consumer fads.  NPR.  BBC.  Christian Science Monitor.  The Economist
[comment]The media hasn't changed at all.  It serves power.

It pretended Trump was a legitimate candidate
It pretended Hillary Clinton was some kind of opposite equivalent of Trump
It pretended Trump was "elected
And now it's pretending other things in preparation to see Glorious Leader For Life Trump installed in power forever.
[comment]I have to say Hillary for bad press. But she didn‚Äôt help by not being genuine. She has always been very closed off and lacked self reflection. She came off as cold because she campaigned not to lose instead of campaigned to win. 

For better or for worse presidential politics is a cult of personality. The presidents of the last 40 years have been the person who presented as being a genuine person and showed their personality
Clinton presented as stiff. And her lack of interviews didn‚Äôt help. She is doing more candid interviews now.
[comment]Listen to her interview with Howard Stern from 2019. If THAT Hillary had run she would have easily been president. I liked her before. I loved her after.
[comment]I always felt that her unlikeability was always a third party branding that worked really well.
[comment]The fake propoganda machine on the right made her out to be evil like Trump tries to do with everyone that opposes him.   How much better of a president would she be than the current one....
[comment]It's totally irrelevant whether she's likeable or not. What matter are policies and ideology.
[comment]I think that's only half right. By keeping Hillary on a tight leash[comment]Thank you ‚ÄºÔ∏è
[comment]Amen. It's unreal to me how the press turned her into some sort of monster.

When she says that people generally dislike her when she's running for something[comment]It's amazing to me how many people on the left still think all the debunked garbage about Hillary is true and call her "evil".
[comment]But none of those were major party presidential nominees. I am not saying all politicians have that skill.

"Polls" in general are pretty unreliable[comment]only half? well[comment]That seems low but then again he is the Commander in Chief* so there may be some active duty personnel that feel compelled to voice approval without actually feeling that way.

[comment]The reason that Trump can‚Äôt say what he thinks the crime was is because it would be ‚ÄúObama improperly tried to get dirt on a political rival to influence an election.‚Äù

Which is what Trump was impeached for.

He also can‚Äôt say it because Obama didn‚Äôt do that‚Äînone of this information came out prior to the election.

[comment]Sue them into insolvency.

It's literally a convo between Joy Reid and Gabe Sherman....that means nothing.

If you think somebody who‚Äôs already thinking that Trump is getting railroaded by partisan Democrats is going to change their tune when they read that they‚Äôre not passing the articles on to the House
It was a great move to impeach Trump. It needed to be done. But this won‚Äôt help anything and could make his base even more energized come November.

Let's fight for a fair trail.
[comment]Another advantage is that the senators running for president on the Democratic side will be able to focus on their campaigns and not have to deal with the hearings.
[comment]I dont need to read the article to know it is brilliant.  She is a genius! Old Moscow Mitch sure doesn't like getting his own treatment! She has them all going ballistic and it is a wonderful thing to behold.  I hope she holds them articles as long as Mitch held up Garland.
[comment]If Mitch McConnell stubs a toe three times a day he wouldn't really notice it because elves feet are very callous.
[comment]Trump and the GOP were complaining since day one that he wasn't getting a fair trial[comment]The House should look into Trump's emoluments violations and tack that article of impeachment on to the list in 2020. They can deliver *all* the articles of impeachment to the Republican Senate some time in 2020 when it's most inconvenient for them.
[comment]Are we sure this is it and not an attempt to sabotage Bernie and Warrens campaigning efforts in Iowa right before the state caucuses?  Just sayin worth a thought. Convenient that Biden and Pete would be helped by this.
[comment]Maybe the hold up has something to do with the Supreme court having to hear his appeals in the three cases on March 2020.
[comment]Color me skeptical.  Mitch and Trump aren't rational or moral.  They will gladly pretend like there is no impeachment as long as the articles aren't delivered.

The Democrats are the ones that wanted to push things through by the end of the year.  Trump and company were glad to let the courts settle things[comment]California 2020 Election

[title]If you watch Trump this week he looks dejected[selftext]https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/fjshln/if_you_watch_trump_this_week_he_looks_dejected_as/[comment]He will eventually die a bitter mumbling old man with only paid sycophants around him pretending they care.
[comment]He has the virus and looks sick
[comment]He hasn't even ONCE mentioned having any sympathies for the people afflicted with COVID-19 or have lost a loved one.  The man is severely emotionally/intellectually/developmentally impaired and fails as a leader.
[comment]Coping means you have a strength that enables  holding on. 
Trump is weak. He isn't coping. Ivanka tells him  he is. He isn't. I look forward to the bastard completely losing his ****.
[comment]Trump is completely unprepared
[comment]I will die before trump voluntarily resigns. He has way too much of an ego to ever do that
[comment]The fastest response  ever since Obama left him in such bad shape.
[comment]He's the ultimate ghoul.
[comment]I think he just realized that he can't tweet his way out of the Corona pandemic
[comment]Put a moron in charge[comment]We need a Mensch.
[comment]It's insane how awful things have gotten to the point that Pence being President would be a huge relief. At least he is literate and capable of taking in new information. But it could be the difference between millions of deaths and tens of millions of deaths worldwide[comment]He can't resign because he'll be subject to finance crimes in NY state. He needs to win so the statute of limitations runs out and he can't be prosecuted.
[comment]Id respect him 100% more if he resigned.
[comment]Being President aged Barrack like 20 years. Even when you are doing the worst possible job you can do it probably is stressful. When you have to rate yourself you are stressed and lonely.
[comment]He gave himself a 10 out of 10! He's perfect guys. He never makes mistakes. He is the bestest wisest most biggest hands smarts most stable genius ever. His uncle went to MIT so it runs in the family and he has a natural talent for biochemistry so Trump will formulate the cure soon!
[comment]If we really look at this. Tariffs led to a protein shortage in China forcing the market to offer protein alternatives like wild meat. Ok the Chinese government banned imports from the US in the midst of a swine Ebola that removed millions of Chinese swine from the markets. The US banned certain imports from China. Thankfully not trump ties or Ivanka hand bags but the Chinese reaction did impact imports of US pork to China hence leading to the ‚Äúwild meats‚Äù in local Chinese markets. So in a convoluted way our fearful leader is ultimately completely responsible. But rated his response a 10 when he is solely in a large part responsible for the mess we find ourselves in.
[comment]It would be nice if we could focus on substance rather than aesthetics. Trump's policies and appointments have always been where 99% of the harm originated[comment]You are right. 

I remember a coworker had a saying : "Lead[comment]Hello[comment]Completely devoid of empathy?!??! Come on. If he was up there apologizing all the time and offering sympathies[comment]Let's stop calling our elected officials "leaders" please.  They're representatives.  Let's vote for representatives please.
[comment]Donald Dump
[comment]Exactly what I was saying the whole time. He doesn't even care about his base. He can watch his supporters burn alive and wont bat an eye while counting the bills in his wallet.  

So if he doesn't care about his base
To be honest
But I just want someone who isn't dismissive
In my personal opinion
But I feel like the reason why it hasn't happened yet is because political party clashing prevents anything from happening and thus now no one can see who's ideas are better for the country. 

Am I wrong? Don't we all want to achieve the same goal which is make a better life for people? What middle ground is possible?
[comment]He sees the writing on the wall. Even he knows he fumbled this one in his own end zone. The universe literally gave him an opportunity to be a hero as we have no choice but to look to our government right now. Except he set himself up for failure so hard and he can‚Äôt actually handle it so he‚Äôll forever be cemented as an absolute failure even to the people that didn‚Äôt wanna believe it before. And he‚Äôll have no way of rationalizing it in his head either.
[comment]Exactly[comment]Why does he look dejected[comment]All he cares about is the market.  He is deluded when he says "there's tremendous pent up demand" and that will somehow magically make everything better.  Never mind that only 50% have any stock market exposure at all
Meanwhile in a month or two there will be countless millions who haven't worked in weeks and with so many Americans going pay check to pay check they will have no money for food and have to resort to begging or soup kitchens.  Rent payments will not be made
Even worse people will be dying in droves because they are sick at home and can't get to hospital and even if they could the hospitals are full and have so few respirators that 90% of those needing them will be triaged to die. Many
And there Trump sits[comment]He was outclassed by the job on day one.
Ref- trumps comments - exiting day 1 briefing
[comment]I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say he and Pence are absolutely tired to the brink of exhaustion and terrified about this virus. He has a lot of lives in his hands and he knows it. Show some sympathy.
[comment]Saying can't stand the man is an understatement for me. He walked into a relative slam dunk of decent economy[comment]He‚Äôs not feeling well because he has it..... he hasn‚Äôt been getting his spray tans so he is looking pale
[comment]Pelosi for President. Pence and Trump gotta go together.
[comment]Is anyone else CONVINCED he is lying about his negative test result?! 
I think he ‚Äúcares‚Äù all of a sudden because it‚Äôs impacted him personally. He can‚Äôt see past his own nose so either he or one of his kids had tested positive. I‚Äôd bet my hat!
[comment]This is because Fox News is telling him it is bad.  Not because the CDC or WHO[comment]Keep Trump in office please[comment]True he is onky thinking about himself n hus REELECTION but nonabout the american lives...A demagogue took the world in the 20 century and in the 21 century another took U.S. to its knees

[comment]So the Russians silenced the black vote in 2016? This article misses the mark by a decent margin.  Hillary Clinton was uninspiring and heavily flawed.  That's why black millennials voted third party or stayed home.

Even Republicans have said that they would have voted for Tulsi Gabbard...but no you all HAD to have Biden.  Hell I am a Trumper and even I would have thought twice if it was between those two.

She is :.

1. A veteran ( republicans \*\*love this\*\* )
2. Suspended her campaign to serv and then restarted once she was back from duty ( republicans have wet dreams about a candidate like this!\*\* )
3. She is young and fit4. She some supported limits on abortion ( Again5. Does not like foreign wars after having to actually be in a warzone as a marine.

Compare those thoughts to Biden or Bernie.

[comment]Because there were less jobs to create. We have more jobs than people[comment]But it still created jobs right ?
[comment]No surprise[comment]Why don't you compare Obama's first 3 years with trumps last 3 years
[comment]Obama's 1st 3 years we lost jobs.......

[title]Obama to endorse Biden for president today
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/obama-endorses-biden/index.html[comment]This is a big fucking deal!
[comment]**Here is the text for those who dont want to click the link**    

&gt;(CNN)Former President Barack Obama will endorse Joe Biden on Tuesday
&gt;Obama will make the endorsement of his former vice president in a video message
&gt;The endorsement reunites the former running mates and positions Obama
&gt;It also marks the public re-emergence of Obama into the political arena. The former president kept a low public profile throughout much of the Democratic nomination fight
&gt;Two people familiar with Obama's video say it is intended as more than a simple endorsement of his friend and former vice president. His message is designed to address this particular moment in America and around the world
&gt;Obama will acknowledge how frightened people are and explain why he believes Biden is the right person to lead the country in this time of crisis
&gt;Obama will also speak directly to progressives
&gt;Obama in November said he had spoken to all of the candidates during the campaign
&gt;Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race

&gt;"We have a field of very accomplished
&gt;Obama had long said he would get behind the eventual nominee
&gt;That relationship
&gt;As Sanders worked to determine the future of his campaign
&gt;"We need you in the White House. I will do all that I can to see that that happens
&gt;In the few moments where Obama did speak out about the race
&gt;And the former president told the candidates to avoid going so far left that they go beyond where voters actually are.

&gt;"My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are
&gt;It is this period of the campaign
&gt;"He is uniquely positioned to galvanize the party around the nominee and increase voter turnout so that a Democrat is successful in the general election
&gt;Jarrett said that they believed it was "important" to let all the candidates "stand on their own two feet" but that once a nominee was selected
&gt;Obama's popularity inside the Democratic Party was clear throughout the presidential campaign. A number of candidates ran ads featuring either images of Obama or the former president's voice
&gt;But the extent with which Obama can reach out to Sanders' supports is questionable
&gt;Biden was not shy about his admiration for Obama throughout the 2020 campaign. Biden often described himself as an "Obama-Biden" Democrat and
&gt;The former vice president even used part of his first major rally as a presidential candidate in 2019 to laud his former boss as "an extraordinary man."

&gt;"I watched up close
&gt;This story is breaking and will be updated.

[selftext]https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/bloomberg-and-the-black-vote-in-2020.html[comment]Because it worked?
[comment]The answer is because African American and Latino communities are able to accept his apology and see the bigger context and all the good he has done for people of color. These are the same reasons Ralph Northman is still governor of Virginia and Justin Trudeau is still prime minister of Canada.
[comment]I have to say there's something morbidly and horrifyingly funny about African Americans supporting a man who implemented a policy more race targeted than the 90s crime bill :/.
[comment]Slightly off topic but bloomberg got nothing in iowa. 

Nothing in nh.. was he even on the ballot? 

Is polling at basically nothing in sc and nev. 

What's the goal here? Its looking like we're going to be 4 races in him finishing under yang and steyer in all of them. 

He's looking completley unviable.
[comment]Replacing one rich billionaire with another is not the answer. The only place bloomberg belongs is on the chopping block if he ends up getting trump reelected

[comment]Bet she's getting "concerned" now probably on the verge of being "troubled"
[comment]This is a good sign but I would like to see the gap a little bit larger because I would imagine Susan Collins is going to have a huge advantage in terms of name recognition than her opponent.
[comment]I thought she said she would retire!?

[comment]Come on Maine vote Susan Collins out of office maybe she'll have to take a perp walk from the Senate just like they made the good man lieutenant colonel vidman do from the White House. If Susan Collins does take a perp walk there's a real reason for it unlike lieutenant colonel vidman he didn't deserve what he got nor did his brother or anyone else involved in the impeachment of the orange man / orangutan.

[comment]Clear as Kushner.
[comment]He has no legal authority. None. 
The election doesn‚Äôt need his commitment to happen. 

That being said you can already see what POTUS is trying to do with his comments regarding mail in ballots not being allowed to count. 
The GOP and POTUS are going to try everything they can to maintain their power. The courts are going to be busy ruling on a lot of proposed voter suppression related tactics that the GOP will use to disenfranchise voters. This is a calculated plan on their behalf.
[comment]WTF? The federal government doesn‚Äôt control the elections nor when the president has to leave office.

[comment]Yeah Kushner I am going to need you fuck to the off right about now.
[comment]If the election doesn‚Äôt go forward as planned trumps term expires anyway and Nancy Pelosi becomes president. Trump doesn‚Äôt have the authority to stop this election so Kushner certainly can‚Äôt do anything.
[comment]The election must occur if he wants a chance of staying in office as if it doesn't then the president and his vice president are removed from office anyways by the constitution automatically.
[comment]Kushner is more or less the president right now. The next AG needs to scrutinize every single action this dip dingle has done in the last few years.

I was pretty sure the deadline is written into the constitution. There is no question about what happens if somebody were to cross the deadline. Not sure why Kushner is not taking a deadline like that serious. Crossing a deadline like that cannot end well. Americans take our deadlines very serious.
[comment]He looks like the mannequin with makeup on to make him look human

[comment]Why does Trump HATE Americans so very much?
[comment]In all honesty these cuts should pass. The majority of his base and red states will suffer while the majority of blue states will find a solution to take care of its citizens. 

The only bad thing is republitards will start a massive influx migration to blue states. Then they will demand changes in democrat local governments trying to have what they ran from.

[selftext]https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/01/pete-buttigieg-enrages-left-liberals-2020-091479[comment]This is interesting and actually makes me like him a bit more. Mayor Pete maddens me because of the last election. It makes me crazy that a man can get this far with no experience. Of course the ass we have as our president now also has no experience but is that what we are going for?
[comment]This article comes close to realizing the point and then misses it completely.  It‚Äôs about some left-right spectrum.  It‚Äôs about money in politics.
[comment]The young left does not trust those whose campaigns are largely financed by Wall Street. Any other young lefties are welcome to chime in.
[comment]Because he's a bought and paid for political hack[comment]Why &lt;Anyone not named Bernie Sanders&gt; Enrages the Young Left.

Literally put any candidate name in this title and the result is the same.  It's why the young left tore down Kamala with Racist and Sexist lies and attacks.  It's why they tear down Warren.  It's why they tell lies about Biden.  It's why Sander's supporter gleefully went all in on Pizzagate
Just look at the people posting shit about Pete in r/politics and here.  Look at their histories.  They did the same thing with every candidate
It's not Pete
I have yet to see anyone Prove that Pete's funding is from "wall street"
But luckily
The "young left" are mentally diminished malcontents that simply worship a messiah.  It's sick.  They are no different from Trump supporters.

It's all about their messiah and the cult of hate they belong too.  If Buttigeig falls in the polls and someone else rises[comment]I think the huge privilege that Pete Buttigieg has that no one mentions is his Christianity and Military Service. Both of these things are often used by the right wing (and many centrists) as a way to indicate who the ‚Äúreal Americans‚Äù are. 

Military service (prior to the repeal of DADT) is incompatible with an open and honest life for LGBT folks
Christianity is literally the enemy of LGBT folks
I feel like Pete Buttigieg is a huge sellout to the LGBT community. We do not need to be veterans or Christians to have a seat at the table. If people can‚Äôt accept us for who we are[comment]Because he is a gentleman.. and that form of masculinity has gone out of vogue.

[comment]I remember Stop and Frisk.  Not gonna vote for him.

But.  This did make my opinion of him[comment]I have my opinions of Bloomberg but he deserves credit for this if he follows through. Trump has to go
[comment]I will be voting for him in the primary.
[comment]Gonna need all the money the dems can get. Sux that campaigns are run on money but look at how much foreign ruble Trump has gained.
[comment]I mean I love this. We can use all the help we can get[comment]good on him
[comment]I agree with other posters I have my own thoughts on Mike Bloomberg[comment]Didnt he use prison labor as a call center? Could this play just be to get good PR?
[comment]Bernie would never
[comment]No campaign should accept.
[comment]Translation: If I can't buy my way into the presidency[comment]Im just happy this is bugging the shit out of the dummy.
[comment]Does this asshole do anything besides write checks? That‚Äôs his solution to every problem.
[comment]Anything to get more votes.
[comment]We‚Äôll see about that
[comment]What I like about Bloomberg is that he hasn't smeared or attacked any of the other Democrats. He's focused on Trump.
[comment]Compare Michael Bloomberg to Shelton Addelson who got a 600 million dollar tax cut and immediately kicked back 100 million dollars to the Republican Party.
[comment]Bernie Sanders has entered the chat.
[comment]If this is/stays true Bloomberg just became my current #2. Now I just need to research his policies.
[comment]Whoever? Let's pick any Democratic thing[comment]$100 says he goes back on this promise after Bernie wins the nomination.
[comment]Cool[comment]This is the first and only respectable thing Bloomberg has ever done. 

Let‚Äôs hope he actually pulls through and isn‚Äôt talking out of his ass. You know[comment]Trump keeps proving that he is the best president[comment]Bernie in the house!
[comment]I wonder if Bernie or Warren would accept his support
[comment]Uhhhh. That works I guess?

Could have put the money toward that without wasting it on his own run[comment]We have got to get Trump out of office. Let's take the help.
[comment]He could do this without running too.
[comment]I seriously[comment]I hope the party rallies behind whoever the nominee is...
[comment]buying elections is wrong in any form.
[comment]Vote BLUE no matter who!
[comment]Well... I guess that answers the question I heard posed on MSNBC the other night.

[comment]Haven't you heard though? He doesn't agree that we have the most cases. Problem solved[comment]Yeah[comment]HA! You don't that every country is as honest with the figures do you?
[comment]I mean[comment]Extremely hard to believe China's numbers though.
[comment]Most countries do not test much though.
[comment]Orange don't listen[comment]That‚Äôs because we are testing more and actually reporting numbers. If you think we have higher numbers than China you are sorely mistaken. Stop spreading misinformation. Now downvote me.
[comment]china is lying[comment]Tiger blood# winning #coffefe
[comment]This is true for confirmed cases but cases are going massively underreported in numerous places like Ecuador[comment]36% of known cases.
[comment]Hey is this garbage upvoted? It‚Äôs very clear that China has the most cases.

[comment]Only a scumbag with no conscience would use this crisis for his own political gain. But we already knew he is a scumbag[comment]Guess what...Trump does not give a damn!
He personifies the worst of american society and we put him in charge. He is all those thugish things we despise but due to our hipocrisy we pretend we don't care. With others it is the end of the worldWe have to vote better next time[comment]Why is this narrative being peddled daily?  No way we have the most cases.  We just happen to report what we have truthfully. 

Stop with these threads. Waste of time on every level.
[comment]Would Trump administration develop more effective countermeasures had we known the real numbers from China early on?  In order to ask this question[comment]The Obama administration walked incoming Trump administration officials through a hypothetical scenario in which a pandemic worse than the 1918 Spanish flu shut down cities like Seoul and London in early 2017
During the briefing[comment]To be fair[comment]https://i.redd.it/xi6jq0ldxst41.jpg
[comment]Using this site to make political points is stupid regardless of your political standing.  


I hate Trump with all my  heart but please refrain from using countries self reported statistics as evidence of anything. There are obviously alot of lies coming from plenty of countries. Deaths are reported differently (for example I read in Swedish news recently that UK

And even so

Please stop making these stupid attempts of political points. If you want to make people change their minds about Trump make valid ones[comment]Amen on a grandiose scale!!! He seems to think if he just screams stuff looking and loud enough we'll all start to believe it! I cannot even believe he still talks About "winning "when the death toll is over 30[comment]He must not be reelected or selected. Can't happen. Words defy me with this one...
[comment]According to a recent Stanford study

[comment]No kidding.  I am so sick of Trump.  He has to lose in November.  The guy is a walking stack of bullshit.  I don't think and Republican has the right to complain about Benghazi ever again.  The way Trump has handled the coronavirus is worse.

The GOP is not a political party.  It's a Russian-backed
Until Democrats figure that out[comment]Graham can jump on that train as well[comment]That‚Äôs like saying there‚Äôs honor among thieves .

[comment]Even with Chief Justice Roberts overseeing the Senate trial with rules set by Republicans during the Clinton impeachment[comment]They need to send this to an actual trial with judge and jurors picked from American voters. Otherwise it will be a sham just like they are saying.
[comment]Moscow Mitch doesn't give a shit about an oath.
[comment]Republicans already said that they don't plan on even pretending to do this fairly or to be unbiased.  They will not recuse themselves[comment]Good. Democrats need to be running ads on TV calling out this disgraceful behavior. Republicans villainized Pelosi[comment]The whole impeachment is a big sham IMO.

[comment]Shit-hole country
[comment]Everyones favorite Democrat up to 2016. You reap what you show[comment]I highly doubt that Trump is going to debate the Democratic nominee. Not that there's any point to it. Biden will tear Trump apart but the Trumpettes will claim Doni Boy won. It's what they do.
[comment]If he gets re-elected[comment]He finally made a speech (Mar 14 noon est) where he did not shift blame or attack any democrats

He still only thanks his loyalists - but he mentioned "and working with Nancy Pelosi" but did not thank her.

Just curious if bill passed contained  any sneaky things not related to Coronavirus
[comment]Dems should censure him for his lies and the fucking media needs to stop saying "that's false" because when you know something is false and willfully state it as true that's what the rest of us call a goddamn lie.

Another reason to throw a few bucks towards PBS.  Asking the tough questions.

[comment]The World Health Organization had working tests that the United States refused

He does not care about the well being of Americans. He only cares about himself and his image. And now we are all paying the price for Trump's stupidity. UGH.
[comment]For those of you who want to read an interesting post[comment]For those of you who want to read an interesting post[comment]Of course the orange idiot denies it.....he can‚Äôt ever admit he did anything wrong.

[comment]How can he possibly be re-elected[comment]Just a note
[Texas has vote by mail.](https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/reqabbm.shtml)

To be eligible to vote early by mail in Texas
* **be 65 years or older;**
* be disabled;
* be out of the county on election day and during the period for early voting by * personal appearance; or
* be confined in jail
Republicans are afraid.
[comment]And if we retake the White House and Senate
- Expand the size of the House of Representatives- Admit several if not all of the territories as states. +2 Dem senators for each one you add.

The short-term effect is a prolonged Democratic majority to begin undoing the damage of the Republicans since the Reagan administration. 

The long-term effect[comment]We know
[comment]This isn‚Äôt true. Instead what would happen is that the Republican Party would be forced to adapt
Although I‚Äôm probably just being pedantic here.
[comment]Parties would adjust their program. A two part system always converges to 50/50. Just like two ice cream sellers always end up next to eachother in the middle of a beach. 

See: Pareto optimum.
Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a situation that cannot be modified so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off.¬†
[comment]You would NEVER in a million years have to twist his words to make him look bad. He's his own worst enemy. He's lucky his base is not very bright. That's definitely a huge plus for him because everything he says goes right over their heads[comment]Remember when he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about controlling the narrative
I think that was something they told him behind closed doors and they forgot to tell him to not say it out loud.
[comment]This has been known for years 
That's why the Republicans try to make it so hard to vote.
 
Can somebody explain this to Trump[comment]I think he's trying to insinuate that people who vote Democrat are lazy.
[comment]Because of voter fraud. You didn‚Äôt finish it. Republicans for some reason assume the best in people.
[comment]Sounds like BS.
[comment]I don‚Äôt think any republicans have ever refuted this. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been working so hard to suppress voting rights.

[comment]Fun fact..for all the network's flaws[comment]Pathetic that there are his zombie goose-stepping followers will all nod their head in agreement. Even calling Fox to have the pollster(s) fried. More than pathetic.
[comment]trump is an idiot!
[comment]Trump demands Fox lie about his popularity to appease his fragile ego. That‚Äôs the headline.
[comment]Because facts and data are biased against him.
[comment]Is it in Fox News‚Äô best interest to have polls showing republicans losing[comment]I would be careful about relying on polls. Most polls showed Hillary winning in 2016 and look what happened there.

I think it‚Äôs great that we‚Äôre ahead[comment]Put Kellyanne Conjob on the polls again Orange guy...she lies almost as much as Trump
[comment]Hey drumpf we all know how you love to win awards even giving yourself an award that you didn't win[comment]Meh. Trump has been ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù in nearly every single poll in 2016. Yet[comment]He‚Äôs so pathetic lol
[comment]I dont like trump at all[comment]This one-term loser is going down hard.
[comment]Wow does fox not want viewers bec I doubt they love the polls either
[comment]I hope it's good for us if even Fox News has him losing.
[comment]What was the response of Fox News and of the pollster?
[comment]It‚Äôs not quite State Run Media... yet.
[comment]Facts and numbers are stubborn things. Viruses are even more stubborn
[comment]What a loser! Is he going to fire everyone who is against him? Like almost the whole America?
[comment]Ffs  lmao
[comment]I'll quote Lizzo...Truth hurts.
[comment]Narcissism. Just the most blatant case of all time. Instead of trying to understand the cause of any issue he always shoots the messenger.
[comment]If anything
He's stupid like a fox.
[comment]This dude is a child. What an absolute embarrassment to this country
[comment]Lol that pic in the thumbnail is particularly bad
[comment]i mean[comment]I'm concerned about the accuracy of all the polls that show each Democrat leading for the general election.  Right now each Democratic candidate is spending their money just to win the primary. The RNC has tons of money that they get to keep dry to use for the general election. It makes sense that the Democratic candidates would be ahead now since they are in effect campaigning. But when only one is designated as the nominee then they are going to get the full brunt of all that RNC cash being spent in the general campaign. That and the fact that in any election the incumbent is going to have an advantage has me very concerned.
[comment]Let‚Äôs just fire his nasty dumb ass instead!!!!!
[comment]Yeah we all know how good polls are with trump
[comment]I love the thumbnail photo[comment]Maybe these Fox polls are a tool to scare them to make sure the trumpers go out and vote. Considering the expected democratic voter this election. Just a thought.
[comment]Fox news is not doing enough to protect Trumps fragile ego.
[comment]This made us laugh hysterically.

You can't make this garbage up.

Just.....wow....Fuck this guy.
[comment]Hard to fire away the truth trumbo[comment]Fox News praises him at every turn and he just casually calls them corrupts.
His allies are crumbling just like his little facade
[comment]Of course Fox has the worst polls

[comment]but wasn‚Äôt he doing badly in the polls when he took the whitehouse in 2016?  i mean[comment]He looks like my mother in law in that picture.
[comment]He will find a way to cheat to win this election or dispute the results and the Republican Party will just sit there and do nothing.
[comment]He's such a giant baby.   Look at him.  LOOK at him. 

How do his supporters not see this?    I will never forgive them for this shit.
[comment]He can be behind in the polls and still win the electoral college[comment]Don‚Äôt worry.  Bernie will lose the nomination and his base will vote for Snoopy or something[comment]Nice

It‚Äôs crazy how much paper waste there is from snail mail as well. 

Sincere question - what is the modern case for keeping USPS?  What people or use cases is it serving that digital and FedEx can‚Äôt do equally well?
[comment]You forgot a zero in there popeye. Each person would need to donate ~110...not 11.
[comment]Send your parents or grandparents a card or letter in the mail! They would love that and you‚Äôd be able to use those stamps!!
[comment]Done! (I needed them anyway)
[comment]I‚Äôll buy a book tomorrow.
[comment]I bought two[comment]Ordering now. USPS is awesome[comment]How about charging for stamps to use every time you send and email?  Yeahhhhhj!!

[comment]Ooh[comment]grand idea[comment]Hey people! Are you tired of starving with the given corona lockdown?

So are we!

Luckily for us! We've come up with the perfect solution!

That's why weve started guilting redditors into buying stamps.

Abolishing the EC requires such a high bar it's not even on the cards even if Dems win the senate.

https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/heed-jimmy-carter-on-the-danger-of-mail-in-voting-11586557667
[comment]I know several people that had mail-in ballots thrown out by a republican AG because their signatures didn‚Äôt match. The only ballots thrown out in Missouri were in major metro areas[comment]Funny how this idea wasn't pushed during the last few primaries. Now that it helps the Dem agenda they're game to vote by mail[comment]Prior to the pandemic
However
So
&amp;#x200B;

1. If a voter doesn't get a ballot within a certain time frame2. Each ballot would come with a unique "tracking number" on the inside3. Limited polling stations should remain open (with appropriate social distancing) for people who's ballots by mail all seem to be lost in transit4. We may want to consider a sunset provision so that this applies to this year's elections and maybe the 2022 elections
&amp;#x200B;

One issue that is probably going to arise is that it may be up to the states to determine  whether voting by mail is allowed.  If that happens
If the federal government is not allowed to directly mandate that vote by mail be allowed
There is also a vague possibility we could tie other federal funding to the states to passing these types of voter laws.  For example[comment]I'll bet the percentage of people who support abolishing the Postal Service without a fight is single digits.

This 2019 poll showed 74% loved the Post Office
&amp;#x200B;

[comment]Why didn't we do this before Bernie dropped out so we didn't have to send Wisconsin out into the pandemic?
[comment]It‚Äôs irrational to oppose this as a Republican too. Studies from the slow implementation of vote by mail in Washington showed a relatively small increase in total voter percentage (2-4%) in the places it was implemented in. Some of the marginal increases came from rural counties which had difficult time voting due to lack of access and some of the increases came from younger voters. Also[comment]Personally[comment]The number is eerily similar to trumbo disproval number of 70%[comment]Why can‚Äôt they make a govt website where you can put in your social security number and info  to register and vote online??
[comment]Yeah and a similar percentage want legal weed. 

I‚Äôm waiting still waiting for both issues to get fixed[comment]Ignorant here.  So how would that work?  I get mailed a ballot to my address from the DMV?  How does anyone know I was the one that actually filled it out?  I've never voted absentee so I don't know how it works.
[comment]The Russians are licking their stamps as we speak.
[comment]It's probably just the 70% of voters who will vote for Biden[comment]...and there will be virtually NO FRAUD either.
[comment]This is going to lessen for a while[comment]It's always about 30% of the population on the wrong side of any issue.

[comment]I now HATE republicans.  I knew they were bugs[comment]Rep Adam Schiff:

&gt; "The withholding of military assistance to get these investigations
Murder.
[comment]I'm so heartened by how many people behind the scenes after so smart and ready to defend democracy
[comment]That speech also came right after a Devin Nunes pile of word-vomit that had me so pissed off. No wonder he had a little fire in him too when he gave this little closing speech. It was spot on and much needed after so much Republican lying and just...bullshitting.
[comment]My concern is that this is going to be Clinton Impeachment 2.0
&gt;The bad news for Republicans is that impeachment
As long as they hold their line in the Senate
Nunes and the other Republicans aren't taking this seriously. Every time Nunes opens his mouth he talks about how the TV ratings are bad. He doesn't give a care at all with respect to what is at risk and what this does to weaken the balance of power in our Government.
[comment]An American hero.
[comment]Schiff is a very bad liar.
[comment]I dont know how Schiff manages to keep a straight face when Nunes goes off on his word salad bullshit rants. I'd be tearing my hair out sitting directly next to him.

[comment]This is bullshit.  We have been seeing this for 1

Dumb liberals. Trump is going to win because you‚Äôre party
Don‚Äôt get me started with cranky old pelosi. I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs in cahoots with trump because by god her behavior is something else. Your party is in absolute disarray and I‚Äôm saddened to see such delusional optimism. Just as this whole impeachment trick. Thanks for wasting our tax dollars for nothing you stupid blue fucks. Only DUMB voters who don‚Äôt understand the political system took that news seriously. Good god
TELL me[comment]I am sick of people saying "history will judge." History is written by the victors and I don't seen any indication the Republicans plan on giving up power. The media is complicit as they ignore the threat and promote the idea that this is just another election; vote your pocketbook.

Russia is at war with the United States. Vote your country.
[comment]Or they just won‚Äôt go to jail. Because. You know. It‚Äôs rich assholes in the government and Rich assholes In the government never go to jail.
[comment]Oh yeah he'd start a war for sure to keep his election going.
[comment]Yeah[comment]But there was no crime or even something trump did or said that was wrong or bad. This was a with hunt from the Democrats to try and get trump out of office since they cannot beat him any other way. It's sad to see the democratic party stoop so low.

Get your butts ready for a wild election year.

It's just sad how many people still buy into this narrative[comment]Did anyone think anyone wouldnt  hold onto poqer no matter what?
[comment]I‚Äôm finding myself wondering if we‚Äôre headed for a military coup. And in which direction.
[comment]Trump would not be the first. Ceaser crossed the Rubicon with his army for this exact reason.

[comment]To be fair[comment]it's safe to say that 53% of Republicans are flaming anti-American racists
[comment]Wtf?
[comment]Of course they do I mean Lincoln got rid of their slaves
[comment]Republicans are delusional.
[comment]Believe it or not[comment]Yeah that would be the 53% who think Lincoln did a bad job because they‚Äôre racist
[comment]and the other 47% think he's better than Jesus. The cult of Trump commands that level of stupidity.
[comment]Conservatives hate Lincoln.  This is no surprise.  T_D regularly shits on him for being a "tyrant" and "literally the worst president of all time."
[comment]Ironic that 53% of Republicans thinking Trump is a better president than Lincoln is the most compelling argument for States Rights I've ever seen[comment]Because it's a cult
[comment]Racism.
[comment]I caught about 10 minutes of Fox "News" at a relative's house over the holiday.

It was all about Trump's triumphant visit to Afghanistan
It'll happen any day now
And still
So basically
This is the "manufactured reality" that a third of the country is being force-fed daily
Sigh.

Fortunately[comment]You remember how the GOP treated Lincoln[comment]But every dictator has a core of dimwits that follow them.  We saw Kanye's visit to the Oval Office
He represented less well the billionaire base who regard Trump as their rather dumb guard dog[comment]Yes it‚Äôs a shitty cult almost as shitty as the sample size of this crappy poll....IJS
[comment]Of course they do - shocking part is that it‚Äôs only 53% and not 90%
[comment]Jesus Christ[comment]A significant number if them are trolling. They're doing it to own the libs and sabotage the hated liberal media.

And then another significant portion are in the Cult of Trump and likely have hard feelings about the War of Northern Aggression.
[comment]Fucking how?
[comment]Given the current population of Republicans[comment]I hope the South really does rise again and this time we just let those dumb assholes leave.
[comment]Helps to note that even though Republicans have traditionally loved calling themselves "The Party of Lincoln"[comment]Probably more than 53%.  Source: am Republican and agree.
[comment]"Think" might be too strong a description as to what is going on in their heads[comment]The traditional Republican of the 1960s was actually more educated and darker than today.  They were country club whites and an emerging black middle class and northern.  Eisenhower got in the low-40% of black votes.  Nixon got 37% of the black vote.  Then Goldwater started saying Lincoln wouldn't like his current party's stance on civil rights in 1964.  He slipped the party's standing with important coalitions

Then 1968 Nixon and the Southern Strategy and the Republicans have been playing the same song since: hate sells to the stupid and we can keep the rich in by bribing them with their own money.  African Americans?  They didn't need them with the former Southern Democrats becoming Republicans by the day.

Today
Vote against any and all Republicans you can in 2020.  They can't be trusted as dogcatcher and definitely not trusted to govern responsibly.
[comment]This is your brain off facts
[comment]I love the ‚ÄúSee
Even though we know the parties pretty much traded places since then.

[comment]The heritage argument is absolute garbage. I've heard people say
Some want to say the Civil War wasn't about slavery
Look
I think the naming of some places using Confederate figures like generals should be reviewed and changed. This isn't about erasing history. It's about preserving it the right way so that we can be educated about it without celebrating it.
[comment]They should kick out anyone they see posting them. There is no place in the military for separatist or fascist ideology. If we can keep people out for bone spurs[comment]Makes utter sense.  The union defeated the confederation. It should be looked upon as at least socially treasonous imo. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[comment]Americans aren't comprehending what's going on. Young racists who want to join the militias are encouraged to get basic training in the military and then they are more useful.

God help us if these people ever get control of the Air Force. Oh wait...
[comment]Wait what? How were these flags even allowed to fly on US military bases? They were an enemy flag?
[comment]I have two great sources for people who say the Civil War was about anything other than slavery.

1. Here are reasons for seceding in their own words [https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states)
2. Here is the famous "Cornerstone Address" given by the Vice President of the Confederacy [https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/)

Racism has finally been defeated today. We can all go home now.
[comment]The real news is what took them so long?
[comment]When the General says so[comment]It's not the flag/country they've pledged an oath to uphold.

Matter of fact[comment]It's the equivalent of someone flying an ISIS flag; it's the flag of an enemy that sought to destroy this country. An enemy that was defeated.
[comment]The thing I love is that flag isn't *the* confederate flag.  It only appeared in the \~50s and was a response to the civil rights moment.  If you really cared about your history you would fly your family's flag!
[comment]Good for the Marines and hopefully if it's not already will be removed from all other military bases and then maybe somebody can tell that fucking orange orangutan we have in office in Washington to quit kissing the asses of white trash supremacist and nationalist and thinking these people are fucking heroes or whatever else he praises them for they're nothing but trash!! But then again 40% like this guy because when in a cult you have to agree and do as the dear leader says or you will be out of the cult.
[comment]Is anyone brave enough to see how r/conservative is handling this?
[comment]Worth noting[comment]I might have an unpopular opinion in this case
To be fair though[comment]Its surprising to hear they were even allowed in the first place. Flying the flag of a defeated enemy army on your military base? Odd

Trump voters and non voters tend to be selfish and emotion based. They aren't going to drop Trump/vote Biden based on comprehensive arguments that it'll be in the best interests of all.

Edit: I see this comment is not well favored and apologize to those offended. My point was to present to everyone what racial disparity can look like.

Don‚Äôt quote me but Tamar was killed for being ‚Äúarmed‚Äù however the same did not apply to Kaitlyn. I hope everyone is doing okay x

[comment]Interesting how the person that posted that is African American.
[comment]https://www.prisonpolicy.org/research/race_and_ethnicity/
[comment]what about all the people arrested and killed for nonviolent crime
[comment]Police brutality doesn't just encompass killings. There are endless videos of black people being brutally beaten by police while not resisting in any way. None of us should be supporting authoritarian violence against any race.
[comment]This kind of stuff is pushing me away from the party. This is plain ignorance that I cannot stand behind. Goodbye.
[comment]Despite the fact that African Americans commit 50% of the crime they only make up 30% of those killed by police[comment]Tweekers. Nobody is up in arms about tweeker deaths.
[comment]Jesus[comment]What‚Äôs truly sad about all this rioting is that it‚Äôs minority communities that are being destroyed and most likely will never rise up again
[comment]Such a stupid ass take. No one's denying law enforcement has a difficult job that may[comment]Another thought to add:

I'd figure that the arrest rates for African Americans are higher than it is for white people. They could have more deaths total but significantly more arrests which would be even worse.

Edit: I should proof read my spelling...
[comment]What the rioters are doing now[comment]This means nothing without context. If you have 1000 black people arrested and 4 of them killed during the process against 2 whites arrested with 1 of them killed[comment]Yea but also per capita isn‚Äôt taken into account[comment]So the problem is: A lot of people are cops that shouldn't be?
[comment]Ok. How many blacks/whites are killed during NON-VIOLENT arrests?
[comment]1. This small selected statistic (without citation of real data by the way)
2. George Floyd did not commit violence[comment]Do you guys not see that white people make up 70% of the crime and blacks make up like 29%. So by my math shouldn‚Äôt be that more whites should be killed by cops seeing how many crimes they commit.
[comment] Where are all the videos of cops actually using racial slurs? It's bad for anyone to die like that but damn it we need to focus on black on black crimes and fatherless families. And get off the plantation of welfare.
[comment] Well[comment]George Floyd wasn't committing a crime[comment]Ok so I just had a progressive argue against this point with me. Someone please chime in if they can refute it.

Their argument was sure more white men are killed by the police. Even though black men commit more of the crime. However the only reason black men commit more crime is because the black communities are over policed. 

So there is more from being committed in white communities but the police aren‚Äôt there to catch it because all the resources are spent in black communities.

My only arguments were what empirical evidence do you have for that? As well as low socioeconomic status tends to lead to more crime which is rampant in the black communities.
[comment]They dont care about police brutality at these protests. I was there.
[comment]Truth is 99% perception and 1% facts. add on top most people just want quick and easy answers to complex problems[comment]No[comment]But my emotions!
[comment]Can I see some stats on non-violent crime? Because most of the cases of black people killed by police were in cases where either they were being charged with a nonviolent crime[comment]Isn't the issue about brutality and killings without even being arrested?
[comment]Fake asshole!!!
[comment]What about non-violent
[comment]I‚Äôd be curious about how many were ‚Äújustified‚Äù and the amount of armed vs unarmed
[comment]how about the peaceful black people being killed! you're a fake puppet!
[comment]Is it not clear that what's missing here is the number of African Americans arrested for non violent crimes that are killed. That's the hidden number here.
[comment]Yes but we don‚Äôt now what the black people did and what the white people did. It‚Äôs not a matter of fact how many gets killed it‚Äôs why
[comment]‚ÄúAre Coos Racist‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe War On Cops‚Äù by Heather Mac Donald are both brilliant books on the subject.
[comment]How about:

1) how many other cops have as many complaints against them and are still cops? 

2) who reviewed all of these complaints against this cop and decided he could still be a cop?

3) were any of these complaints ever brought to the attention of the mayor or DA? If so
4) these complaints should be reviewed by a committee that includes citizen representation.

If you really want to fix the system[comment]Are there stats for for non violent crimes and being killed by police? Also what about other races?
[comment]Y‚Äôall know data can be modified with it still be technically true right? There is a reason he didn‚Äôt post for all crime not just violent.
[comment]What about non violent crimes?
[comment]How is it possible?

It's a statistic not per 10
If 1
If one group commits 2 crimes per arrest and the other commits 3 crimes per arrest
What is the actual truth? Difficult to say without the numbers. But
Additionally[comment]How many more 10s of thousands of black people are arrested over whites though?
[comment]Without the numbers for people killed while being arrested for non-violent crimes or receiving a citation
The protests are about the use of excessive force on non-violent alleged offenders.
[comment]When were we talking about VIOLENT crimes?
[comment]This is the stuff we need more of.  I'm getting lit up by friends and family for standing by my ideal that this is a police issue[comment]If black people are arrested more frequently for violent crime than whites it would both account for this statistic and be evidence of pervasive policing bias. This one fact by itself isn‚Äôt really enough to prove anything though it does provoke interesting conversation. Also where is this stat from? Jc
[comment]More white males since 2017 have been killed by police than black males[comment]Yes and black Americans make up 13% of the population. All killing is bad
Anyone who wants a source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/
[comment]It‚Äôs not just about racism. It‚Äôs about the institutionalized police state. Black cops have abused the power to white civilians too. It‚Äôs not just racial but also an issue of police having zero accountability
[comment]Far too many people brigading this thread think this is some sort of attack on black people
I think the vast majority here recognize that black people disproportionately suffer from socioeconomic issues due to racism and other reasons. They are targeted for petty crime
But that doesn't change the fact that police killings are directly proportionate to violent crime. For whatever reason[comment]Although the links provided are still confusing as there is too much info i don't know where to look lol i'm just going to assume the numbers are correct. The way i see it is every person of every race should be treated equally and have the same priviliges. These figures just prove to me that we all need the band together in solidarity to make the change happen and kick racism once and for all. I am a white man from the UK and i've realised it's not enough to just not be a racist but we need to do something about it. The governments over the decades/centuries have had all the power to make this happen but they have chosen to ignore us and divide our nations and will continue to do so[comment]Simple explanation
&amp;#x200B;

This statistic here is misleading as it uses the simpson's paradox.
[comment]Where are the statistics for this clam
[comment]Whatsu the numbers on nonviolent crimes?

Also[comment]Wonder why BLM doesn‚Äôt protest black on black crime. Oh wait they think black on black crime is cause by white people
[comment]There's a lot of back and forth on that thread[comment]Tit for tat... that‚Äôs how I see it!
[comment]I think this country has a serious problem with systemic violence and institutionalized thuggery. We have come to expect and accept it[comment]Is this actually the guy in the photo? Or just another white supremacist catfishing? You're a fraud!!!
[comment]‚ÄúThere are three kinds of lies: lies[comment]Had to save this twice for good measure
[comment]You do realize that white people are 70% or so of the population and black people are 13% right? So when taking about absolute numbers[comment]As usual with the liberal left and Democrats in general

Always[comment][https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02601-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02601-9)
[comment]What I don't understand is how is Police Brutality against Black people a partisan issue? Why must we try and find justifications in murder of people? What the fuck is wrong with this country?
[comment]If you look at the statistics[comment] 60.6%  of the population are white 
12.3% are black 

So maybe run those numbers again.

[comment]I think the issue is not that people are stupid or may do stupid things. Many people from all social classes and all political wings are sometimes stupid or sometimes say stupid things. Many well educated people also do or say stupid things.
That is okExcept when you go on national television during a crisis and you are the President of the USA. Then you really need to put your game face on and be smart. There is no leeway for saying stupid things in such a situation.
Personally[comment]‚ÄúI see the disinfectant
Did he tell people to inject or drink disinfectant? No.  But he suggested it be studied as a cure. It's like someone saying fire kills germs and suggesting we should get it "inside the body" to study it as a cure.
[comment]If you believe he was being sarcastic or making a joke[comment]Something that you inject that disinfects you from disease is called medicine. The fact it's even been suggested as something new to consider is worrying.
[comment]Let's run through the timeline of this shall we?

1. He says we should look into injecting disinfectants.
2. The media reports on what he said making him look incredibly stupid
3. Fox news and other right wing news outlets claim he's being taken out of context.
4. Trump
So tell me was he taking a national crisis lightly by being sarcastic? Was he taken out of context? Or is it more likely he's a bumbling fool? One would think all of you would say he was being sarcastic as that is what he[comment]Trump literally said

But setting all that aside

One of them was Breitbart News

[comment]I am so very confused by the comments

[comment]The fact that half the comments are calling this painting terrible shows that half this subreddit doesn't belong here
[comment]Painted by Andy Thomas. Good piece. The woman approaching in the background is supposed to be the first woman president. There are also a couple more nods in the piece.
[comment]Trumps head is too big.
[comment]I like it with Nixon in there. He makes the Donald fit in a little better.
[comment]The bush family would never sit at the table with Trump sadly.

What do you think is going to happen when you disobey orders from a group of terrified[comment]what are you going to do with your guns? shoot police officers? go to jail for life for killing a cop?
[comment]All over bully and shutting down barbers and restaraunts. But the riots start and no one is around.
[comment]It's a curfew[comment]Was this done because they weren't obeying curfew? A curfew imposed because were being criminals. The officer said "Stay in your home".
[comment]It‚Äôs how they are doing this. They look untrained. Lack of training and lowered standards is what cost the first life.
[comment]I bet people will be 100 times  happier to see these cops than a group of rioters burning down homes and property.
[comment]You‚Äôll discover very quickly the difference between the police and military.
[comment]But if you got rid of all the guns then no one could shoot at you on your own porch.just saying this article seems a little flawed in how it sounds
[comment]Could someone tell me why this was quickly posted here but it took a while for it to appear on r/Conservative and it seems to be quite controversial there? Do these subs not have the same demographic?
[comment]I guess the government has decided the white neighborhoods need to get on board with the coming summer of rage.
[comment]The 2nd amendments purpose is literally for this situation
[comment]I would shoot them with my scout[comment]So what do you do when you run out of ammo after shooting back at the popo? This is when logic just crushes your entire argument
[comment]Given what happened here I wanted to clear up what is happening in Minneapolis. What happened last night was that the rioters were going into porches and pretending to live in some of the houses. This doesn‚Äôt excuse the behavior but I‚Äôm just explaining WHY they ordered her to get inside. 

The media also will not talk about the fact that police officers in Minneapolis were getting shot at and Molotov cocktails were being thrown.
[comment]I'm pro-gun and believe in keeping the government in check[comment]How would you shooting back have helped this situation?
[comment]I‚Äôm okay with the National Guard showing up to try and stop the riots that are hurting and killing people[comment]Where was this?
[comment]The entire MN police force seems to need retraining...
[comment]When ya act like assholes and loot &amp; burn shit down- that‚Äôs the result. Don‚Äôt be mad at the national guard or police- be mad at the assholes taking advantage of a situation.
[comment]That‚Äôs why we should be fighting to lower taxes on the middle class. All we are doing is giving more power to the government and less power to the people.
[comment]The title is very misleading[comment]Or try not burning down the city provoking factions specifically meant to establish order.
[comment]Kill the Nazi police officers on sight. Any officer "following orders" is a threat to civilian lives. They have no capability to think for themselves and no empathy to consider their victims' lives. Everyone needs to get their guns out now or arm up if you don't have any. Set traps around your house if you can.
[comment]We should all know the context of massive riots in Minneapolis.  Along with that[comment]No[comment]I wonder *why* they are patrolling in the first place[comment]We need to organize a counter-protest for the police[comment]Cops like these are nothing but Government boot lickers - no different than Nazi Germany!! 
‚ÄúJust following orders‚Äù - Tyrannical cowards.
[comment]Bruh[comment]Yeah cause opening fire on a group of ~20 cops sounds like a great idea!
[comment]They want to be Democrats[comment]This will resort more protests because only in masses can the people stand up.
One individual guy shooting back will just resort in a gunfight. But protests involving thousands is a whole different ballgame.
[comment]Random pallets of bricks are just randomly showing up in downtown Dallas... this isn‚Äôt a protest[comment]Were riots nearby this neighborhood?
[comment]I say listen to the police orders to go inside
[comment]Reminds me of Modern Warfare 2. "Fall back to the Burger Town !"
[comment]I‚Äôm with you here OP. People seem to forget which side they are on. Anti-authoritarianism is what this is about; not just when it‚Äôs in their favor!
[comment]I can assure you opening fire on officers wouldn't help
[comment]It‚Äôs almost like the second amendment becomes functionally useless in the presence of actual authoritarianism.
[comment]While I‚Äôm not defending the shooting here[comment]I know this will get a lot of hate but:
A
I‚Äôm completely pro guns but the purpose of the 2nd amendment is not to protect against cops armed with paintball guns trying to control a riot.
[comment]Looks like ANTIFA sitting around planning. The National Guard said go back into your house. ANTIFA had a choice and they chose to disobey the authorities. These looters paid the price. Oh well.
[comment]Get inside sounds fine.

Got it....lol

[comment]What's wild is that people are saying Mika "pushed" Biden in this interview. She didn't ask him about the "hugs
Biden says the University of Delaware stuff can't be released because it has records pertaining to his job like his positions on topics and interviews. She should have asked why the public cannot see
This was a pretty softball interview overall
[comment]It‚Äôs hard to comprehend how hypocritical Biden is about his secrecy talking to foreign leaders when Biden and the left demand to know what was said and investigate Trump every time time he utters a word to any foreign leader.
[comment]so... don't release the records because they show my record and that can become "fodder"...

is he not proud of his record?

[comment]R/Politics says this isn‚Äôt a trial and it‚Äôs a job interview when Kavanaugh got accused so no due process is needed. Biden is interviewed for a job so he doesn‚Äôt need due process.

There are clearly actors that are not part of the group instigating violence. It seems antifa is indeed acting within these protests. However[comment]Every republican ive talked to was an idiot. All republicans are idiots üñï
[comment]BLM is a foreign funded insurgency. The BLM goons are out there to sow the seeds of discontent and gin up race hatred. If they were protesting hoping to make the world peaceful
A serial killer spends most of his time not stacking bodies[comment]Except that protesters are regular citizens who may not have the authority
Police officers do have the authority[comment]This is kind of a strawman that you're making here. Clearly not all protesters think ALL cops are bad[comment]The protestors do not believe all cops are bad[comment]I appreciate everyone here having a respectful and knowledgable debate[comment]These protestors are Patriots fighting against government tyranny.
[comment][this was my feed just now. ](https://ibb.co/ZY4CHfy)
[comment]Also - all gun owners are violent criminals


The level of mental gymnastics do these people should qualify for gold every time at the olympics.
[comment]Exactly. There so few people that don‚Äôt have double standards for everything.
[comment]No one polices the police. They get away with 10x more than any normal person. It's a pretty brutal difference. They should be held to a MUCH HIGHER standard than civilians[comment]Its a turd in the punchbowl situation for both sides.
[comment]Honestly I see the logic considering the protestors have been [seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/instantkarma/comments/gug5kf/peaceful_protest_not_raging_riots/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  actively turning the rioters to the police. The day the cops turn the tucked up ones in is when it‚Äôll be equal
[comment]Do you fail to see the hypocrisy in this comment? The right has been telling us for years that "not all cops are bad and it's a few bad apples." Meanwhile[comment]This sub: Authoritarianism is bad

This sub: Protect and respect our boys in blue
[comment]This is not a political issue[comment]Playing devil's advocate: the cops are the ones who have the power[comment]I don‚Äôt see that is their claim at all[comment]Yeah but the protesters aren‚Äôt killing people every single day
[comment]The difference is it isn't the job of the peaceful protestors to stop rioters. It IS the job of good cops to stop bad cops.

The saying isn't "one bad apple makes the whole barrel LOOK bad" it is "one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel."

I don't think most cops are bad people
And that isn't me playing holier than thou. If I were a cop I probably wouldn't have the courage to turn in the bad cops either[comment]Police cannot have any ‚Äúbad apples‚Äù that job like the military needs to have serious repercussions to anyone not doing their job properly.
[comment]Called the ‚Äúnot all Scotsman‚Äù rhetorical case if anybody is wondering
[comment]I personally don‚Äôt mind riots so long as they‚Äôre not geared towards innocent business owners[comment]But yes[comment]I mean the protest is that the system keeps letting this happen but sure[comment]As one user pointed out
https://web.archive.org/web/20200526121443/https://www.insidempd.com/2020/05/26/man-dies-after-medical-incident-during-police-interaction/

"he appeared to be suffering medical distress"

Yes[comment]The issue they are protesting is that the small group of bad cops are protected from persecution when they misbehave
[comment]If you‚Äòre still supporting the cops you‚Äòre farther deranged than Ben Garrison. Just saying.
[comment]The protestors themselves acknowledge this though
There isnt such an acknowledgement within the police force. Would a good man harboring a fugitive not also be legally responsible and charged?

Edit: a word
[comment]Republicans: you can't say all gun owners are violent when it's only a VERY SMALL group being violent! The majority of us use guns for peaceful things! 

Also Republicans: there are a few bad protesters out there so ALL protesters are bad!!

See the fallacy in "the truth" of your post?
[comment]I always thought school was dumb for trying to teach "critical thinking". Like[comment]Remember[comment]The problem is the cops get paid no matter who or how they kill.
[comment]This really isn't a political issue. You can support good cops and still support these protests. The issue stems from the fact that bad cops are not being punished severely enough. That Asian police officer should have told his fellow officer to get off his neck and helped him get up so they could just arrest him rather than stand there to defend his fellow officer. I don't know what went through in his mind but any sensible officer would have noticed that Floyd was in any way a danger to anyone. My brother-in-law is a cop. He damn sure ain't letting a co-worker of his do that in front of him. I respect the work a police officer does but it's not difficult to spot bad cops when you're around then unless you're also a bad cop.
[comment]Isn't the difference that the protesters are calling out the bad protesters for doing bad things while police officers don't call each other out for doing bad things like murder unarmed people?
[comment]Well you can argue that some bad protesters make the whole protest wrong while agreeing that some bad cops make an unjust system.

Or

There are some bad protesters
You‚Äôd be a hypocrite to believe that one group is all bad because of some bad examples while believing the opposing force simply has a few bad apples.

In a nutshell
Thanks for coming to my ted talk:)
[comment]It‚Äôs already been said but there‚Äôs bad people on both sides. But there‚Äôs a systemic problem here that happens all the time[comment]Citizen protestors vs cops who are supposed to work for them... exercising rights vs a job... proof that there are specific agitators in the protests vs endless footage of savage rioting cops... I wonder who‚Äôs in the right. Acab
[comment]i dont think protesting a child rapist is so bad
[comment]Tell me why I have to call my family and make sure they are safe because there‚Äôs all these protestors and looters going crazy and everyone is going down the street just shows they scare me more than cops how dumb
[comment]We can apply this logic to anyone in their tribe and demonstrate why it's unfair to label the entirety of the group due to a nonrepresentative minority commits the transgressions.

Black people? But not all...

Latino? But not all...
[comment]Which one is it
[comment]Two signs I saw from protesters that were extremely troubling. One said abolish the police. I‚Äôm like you need some organization to enforce the law or you have anarchy. The second was all policemen are klansmen. I mean cmon a lot of police officers are black or other minorities. This is an egregious overstatement. There are racist cops but a small minority. No one will take you seriously if you say stupid shit like that
[comment]They are protesting a systemic problem[comment]Almost like protesters didn't take an oath to protect and serve and then go around killing people who can't fight back with impunity or something.
[comment]I don‚Äôt think anyone thinks all cops are bad. Even if it‚Äôs a small percentage (1% let‚Äôs say)
The bigger problem is not the bad cops themselves[comment]Maybe they should have sent the national guard to deal with the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù percentage of bad cops before rioting began.
[comment]Protesters are exercising a constitutional right. Rioters are not. Good cops follow the rule of law and protect individuals constitutional and legal rights. Bad cops break the law in their enforcement[comment]Most cops are good[comment]this is not true
[comment]Of course[comment]Literally makes no sense.

Protesters do not necessarily form coherent group. There is no "protest leader" that can stop bad people from joining in the protest
Police do form groups[comment]This is a strawman  because the movement isn't saying all cops are badThe protest is about ending the cycle and the only way that can happen is if more accountability is legislated. That is the movement in a nutshell.

I personally feel cops should get a huge pay increase akin to doctors[comment]Man[comment]I swear this would have been great 2 weeks ago when society allowed you to live in your own bubble and think every POC was lying about police issues but now if that‚Äôs how you feel then so be it
[comment]Well who‚Äôs Fault is that ?
[comment]We have to get them to achieve more in school.
[comment]Thats not an apples to apples comparison. The problem's with the system/culture that's ingrained into the police. That doesn't make the individuals themselves bad or corrupt. The protestors are not an organized force[comment]Hypocrites: A few bad apples doesn't mean that all police are bad
Also hypocrites: There are few people taking advantage of the protests to loot and riot. ALL PROTESTERS ARE LOOTERS AND RIOTERS.

[comment]During a virus epidemic protesting is a non essential activity according to the police department[comment]Mind repeating that in German?
[comment]They might want to read that Constitution thingy and rhe Bill of Rights. We are not under martial law. Our rights do not go away because some politician issues a decree.
[comment]Then "Democracy" itself is thus a "**non-essential activity" too?**

[comment]So let me get this right[comment]What if the prohibition (on protesting) was temporary for let's say six more weeks. What about three months? Six months? A year?

Temporary is pretty subjective.

[comment]Bruh who is against the education of children
[comment]Republicans and their lack of logic and critical thinking skills
[comment]To those out there who think flattening the curve is the cure:

Flattening the curve isn't going to stop the virus.  Too many people keep thinking that the lock down is going to be the cure to stop the virus when the curve is flattened. That's not how this works or has worked or will work.

It's simply helping ease the virus infection rate that *is* going to occur to the same number of people as though we hadn't quarantined. That's the whole point. Expect to get it at some point (if you haven't already had it
The curve flattening was to help our health system stay on top of it and keep from being over-burdened. It's inevitable that everyone's going to get it eventually. That's an established fact. (again if you haven't already had it and didn't realize it
There *will* likely be a spike in cases for a short (emphasis) period as people start to get back to life and states  (and frankly other countries) start phasing in re-opening their economies[comment]Wasn't it the Republican party that under cuts educational programs and after school programs. As I can also recall most red states have been dealing with teacher strikes since they are underpaid and overworked... (only saying since I'm in a red state and my wife is a teacher) so educational standards are not a main priority for Republicans[comment]Schools are concentrated areas with hundreds and thousands of kids and planned parenthood has a lot less people at a time and they don't only do abortions they have other functions. I am a Republican btw.

And she's been incredibly successful in her goal.  To make people pay attention to those who do know what they're talking about. These two kids have totally different objectives they're tackling
[comment]How dare you!!!
[comment]Ocean plastic and climate change are different issues. Fighting climate change requires policy changes since we need to reduce carbon emission in the future. Boyan's method to clean up plastic waste attacks part of that problem but not all of the plastic in the ocean ends up in the garbage patches. The only way to really combat the problem with plastic in the ocean is policy changes.

[comment]People with these sentiments are going to regret saying this. It may not be tomorrow or even next year     
    
Seasons and tastes change   
The Dems need a mission. Their mission was social justice   
If the dems had just taken a prudent and thought out strategy they could've easily defeated Trump. They are stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. They need a campaign strategy that speaks to the common middle-of-the-road American. They need to cut the hard   
Think about the miners and and factory workers that mother jones organized and unionized in the early 20th century. Those peasants would have no quarter in today's Democrat party. They believed in Christian-based family values

So desperate..

[comment]The DNC is awful and corrupt and I‚Äôm not a fan of joe Biden. Having said that[comment]That‚Äôs honestly disgusting
[comment]Just proves #metoo only works if the person is a republican. It could come out that Biden was just as bad as Jerry Sandusky and people would still vote for him. The silence from the me too movement is deafening.
[comment]Honestly I think you shouldn‚Äôt be able to report it 5 years after it happened especially if the person has became famous or rich

[comment]It's actually not that difficult of a concept. Given the option of two rapists[comment]What a lot of people don‚Äôt seem to grasp is that most Democrats believe all of Trumps accusers are telling the truth and that the infamous grab em by the pussy tape is an actual confession of sexual assault.  So it‚Äôs literally voting between 2 sex offenders for president.  And if you use that logic
Just gonna put that out there and say that I‚Äôm not a Republican[comment]It would help if we all recognize that the primary process as it currently works is failing all around (not just Dems).  We are in transition from a time when stage one of the primary process occurred out of sight before a single vote is cast
With that said
In the highly likely event that Biden is the nominee

[comment]Can we have an extra circle for drinking bleach?
[comment]I feel this post hits the nail on the head. I am a republican conservative and believe we should take the virus seriously. However some states such as California and Nevada are taking this out of proportion. We cannot be confined to our homes that long and simply watch the economy fall. I believe we should all have the choice to quarantine or not. Millions of people are now unemployed and suffering from poverty. However I also believe that those that are high risk such as my grandparents (70) (78) or other people over the age of 50 or those with underlying conditions. We all need to face the virus and gain herd immunity. To conclude far too many people are suffering from poverty and unemployment to continue this mandatory lockdown any longer. But as I said I feel all high risk people such as those with underlying conditions should continue their quarantine. 

Post scripture
Very few or no healthy people under the age of 50 with no underlying conditions have died from this virus. There are viruses that are far more deadly that we‚Äôre not quarantining for such as TB. We need to face this virus and get over it[comment]Yep

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/3z9u4jpovih41.jpg[comment]No no no[comment]Feminist is just another word for a whore.
[comment]Personally I don‚Äôt think abortion should be legal in those circumstances. Why punish a child for their parent‚Äôs crime?

[comment]IMO the abortion debate is less about the act itself but more when we consider life to begin. Whether that‚Äôs conception[comment]Feminists? Really?
[comment]There would be a lot of false rape claims. Oh wait....
[comment]I may be over simplifying it but is the DNC procedure not the cure for both rape and incest? Is that incorrect? Not a doctor
[comment]If a woman can choose whether or not to abort the baby without the fathers consent because she doesn‚Äôt want it
But they ain‚Äôt ready for that talk. It‚Äôs all ‚Äúlet‚Äôs push for women to have MORE rights than men in the name of ‚Äòequality‚Äô!‚Äù
[comment]I‚Äôm totally pro-life but sooooo many more woman would have false rape accusations.
[comment]Committing another horrible act doesn't make the original horrible act go away. The child is innocent.
[comment]I would stand behind the view of a doctor[comment]It honestly should not be legal until we have a general consensus on when life begins. Why is abortion legal with so many unanswered questions and somethign like smoking weed isn't. We know just about all there is to know with something like that and they are still cautiously going about legalizing it
I understand people believe weed should be illegal but in that case so should tobacco and alcohol. But in this case i was just using it as an example since it is still a relatively popular and current topic.
[comment]Yeah but people like Ted Cruz dont want that. Some of these pro life people dont care about that kid once it pops out.
[comment]The way I see it is[comment]Have never once seen anyone say ‚ÄúWe need abortion FOR rape and incest‚Äù
[comment]I believe it should still be a liberty a woman has as a free American[comment]I still disagree. If you believe that abortion is murder[comment]So you should kill the child just because of the dad?
[comment]Wait[comment]Does the way conception occurs decrease the value of the life?
[comment]Why would we allow them for rape and incest anyways? What specifically about rape and incest make a baby worth less than if they were born out of normal sexual relations. To me it is hypocritical that some who can call themselves prolife are fine with killing babies who were conceived through rape and incest.
[comment]I've always thought about the abortion debate with the following logic game:

Can we first agree that there is \*real\* scientific debate over when exactly life begins? As in
That only leads us to one of two possible scenarios of legal and widespread abortion:

Either millions of "potential" lives are cut off for a myriad of reasons up to and including pure convenience of the "mother". 

OR  
We are allowing mass genocide in numbers that are unfathomable.

Seems like an easy exercise in figuring out which side you should err on.
[comment]I don't think a blanket law should be applied here. Should be case by case. Should it be used as birth control? No. The fetus isn't developing properly and likely won't survive birth and if it does it would be severely challenged with hardly any quality of life or risk the life of the mother or some other medical hang ups that may occur. Those are things that should be considered. They might already be I don't know. But an outright ban isn't the answer.
[comment]Rape and incest only contributes to 2% of committed abortions[comment]You know if we increased sex ed and contraceptive funding we would actually cut down on abortions needed for accidental pregnancies but \[y'all ain't interested in that]([https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump))

Republican men would have LOVED to see her become the nominee.
[comment]"We need to support more women... I didn't support Elizabeth Warren." That's all I heard.
[comment]They have been blaming men for a while now. You kind of get use to it.
[comment]I bought into the Indian heritage. She could be lying that she‚Äôs a woman. Fool me once[comment]Maybe there needs to be better women candidates? Just a wild guess though
[comment]We literally almost elected a woman in 2016.
[comment]Actually.

I'd love to see a strong female Republican in office.

Ivanka Trump 2024?

Edit: Nikki Haley 2024?
[comment]xv
[comment]Candice Owen's bro I'd vote for her
[comment]She‚Äôs also a racist
[comment]Warren logic: Verbally attacks white males throughout campaign. Can't understand why white males won't back her.
[comment]Imagine if the first female president is a republican lmao. This view would probably change real quick
[comment]There's still one woman of color in the race. Why not talk about her? Oh right[comment]As a republican woman[comment]They say that but what if it was a Republican woman running for President?
[comment]Fun fact: 2/3 of the women who voted in the Democratic Primary in Massachusetts (her own state) didn't vote for her.

Tell me again how men are to blame for that?

Edit: a letter
[comment]Let's all give men a round of applause. 

Thanks[comment]BRB[comment]Is there zero up/down votes on the comments here for anyone else?
[comment]Warren is a hysterical lunatic and never stood a snowball's chance in hell of becoming President.

I really dont care about the gender of the president. My focus lies with their policy and how good they‚Äôll be able to serve. Im not going to vote for a woman if there‚Äôs a man I agree more with just because ‚Äòwe need to support women‚Äô[comment]Women always seem to need men to blame their setbacks and failures on.

As if I can‚Äôt decide what‚Äôs in my best interest for myself. If we get a female president[comment]Sorry[comment]Ivanka Trump 2024.
[comment]I really don't think too many people have a problem with a woman being president.

When there's a woman candidate with some good policies they'll get votes.
[comment]They will blame literally anyone else before they take the blame themselves for their own failings
[comment]Can Somebody explain to her how feminist that sounds. And at the end she criticizes herself by saying she wouldn't have voted for any of them anyways. Dumb dumb dumb
[comment]I keep having this sneaky suspicion that Biden is a sort of Trojan Horse
Sounds crazy[comment]She needs to calm down Tulsi is still in this election if she wants a woman president so badly.
[comment]You Stupid Bitch
[comment]Then put yourself in a position worth the leadership. Duh.
[comment]We as republicans should put a woman as president just so we can finally get democrats and feminists to shut the fuck up already.
[comment]A truly independent woman would support the best person for the job[comment]isn't like...

[comment]If Leezy ran for president I would quit my job tomorrow to campaign for her. What says you?
[comment]We‚Äôre sorry
[comment]The irony.  We wamens need men in order to be president.
[comment]Here‚Äôs a thought[comment]So I can't just judge her on her opinions and ideas?  I have to see if she has any woo hoos sticking out and vote on that?
[comment]We must all racist against fake American Indians.
[comment]Well[comment]I dont want women in leadership positions. It never goes well[comment]If there is a woman that would run that shows competence for the position[comment]How about we just elect the best person for the job and stop making everything about sex and race?
[comment]I vote for the person who I think will do what‚Äôs best for the country. These identity politics are really blinding the Left from seeing reason!
[comment]Warren is a straight out thief.   It's amazing that a woman of color would support her in any way.   Warren continues to be listed as the first person of color to receive tenure at Harvard Law School.  She has stolen this title from someone who actually served it
[comment]Just seems like a weird concept ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a women president yet so we should support female candidates‚Äù. Shouldn‚Äôt we pick the most trusted/qualified/intelligent candidate?
[comment]I would have voted for a condoleezza rice and she is a black female and I'm a white male. To be honest I probably would have voted for her over Donald Trump at first. Knowing now what I know I'm glad she didn't run against him cause I'm not sure if we would've ever gotten another shot with trump.
[comment]I bet she‚Äôs a certified yoga instructor.
[comment]How about I want to vote for the most qualified person regardless of their phallic status?
[comment]Present me with a woman running for President that has a platform I agree with[comment]over half of democratic voters are women.
[comment]Put up a woman worth voting for.
[comment]I gave money to Carly Fiorina's campaign because I thought she was smart and I liked her philosophy[comment]Of course the left will blame men. Because some women are apparently not yet advanced enough to admit our own screw ups and say "I couldn't get it done." We're only advanced enough to blame men. Will it ever occur to pathological lying sociopath Warren Out that her constant lies did her in.
[comment]I would vote for a black 40 year old woman who is a Republican then a 75 year old white guy democrat.
[comment]We elect someone based on the content of their character not the composition of their chromosomes.
[comment]But I thought democrats were all inclusive and equality supporting? How dare they not support a woman!
[comment]Refused to vote for a pathological liar?  Must be sexism.
[comment]I'll gladly vote for a SMART women for president. There are plenty of business women out there that I think could do a good job. Warren just is dumb and not for the American people.
[comment]I‚Äôm not gonna vote for someone whos an idiot and has terrible ideas just cause they‚Äôre a woman. So no[comment]I agree.  Men are to blame.  

I can‚Äôt be her amazingly low turnout.  Or her history of being the worst kind of race pimp.  Or the blatant dirty tricks she used openly on people like on Sanders.  Or her profound fakeness.  Her willingness to lie about literally anything.

It was men.

&gt; Just saying not to write all of us off. I'd say at least half of our counties are solidly republican. A lot of them may have smaller populations but they're there.

They censored a tweet from the POTUS talking about shooting americans. They left his ‚Äúonly good democrat is a dead democrat‚Äù tweet alone though. He lost the popular vote so what he thinks over half of the voting population should be killed? What a joke of a country lmao
[comment]I never did pretend is was a neutral platform...

Who ever did? Who still is?

And neither is Reddit. It's as far left as you can get.
[comment]It's time to stop pretending any platform is neutral.
[comment]Yea let‚Äôs focus on the pandemic and record unemployment.
[comment]social media is a failed experiment in humanity
[comment]Time to stop pretending  reddit and all of social media are neutral.  I'm starting to think all of social media is a cancer on the planet for healthy societies
[comment]Everyone knows Twitter blows.
[comment]Nothing is a neutral platform anymore. I only see one side of the news on Reddit[comment]...ALL social media platforms ! Not just Twitter
[comment]Losing CDA 230 immunity and federal advertising revenue will hurt. Hope the Board is ready for shareholder lawsuits.
[comment]I'm very hesitant to tread down this path. Anybody notice the stickied comment on every post in this sub?

&gt; /r/Republican is a partisan subreddit

The government pulling platform status is dangerous for everybody. We can be mad that lots of people use twitter and point out twitter is often wrong but once you pull out the dinner table cloth there's no easy way of putting it back
[comment]When I joined the various social platforms I had the expectation of neutrality.
[comment]I made a comment on some lefty site to that effect and got pummeled with down votes. 
Convinced Reddit is controlled by communist China/looney left.

Twatter is the biggest joke. I was booted for a week for saying all pedos should hang. 

You would think they wouldn't be against that.
[comment]So Twitter is a little biased so let‚Äôs start a bill to try to take it down?
[comment]Why have republicans suddenly decided they hate the concept of private property? Feckless communists. Y'all are the same as democrats now. Ridiculous.
[comment]Well I mean it is a private company so they can swing whichever way they want. Zuck criticised what they did but his company is also private so they‚Äôre both entitled to doing things in different ways
[comment]Twitter is trash
[comment]Never once did I think it was neutral. It‚Äôs a cesspool for SJWs.

[comment]Disagree.

I think Bernie
The DNC hates him so he's doing something right lol
[comment]Bernie would absolutely tank the economy so Wall Street would get behind Trump. Trump will easily beat him. 




Bernie is a self admitted socialist[comment]I remember during the West Virginia primaries in 2016 news stations were asking people who they supported. People were supporting Bernie. When asked who they planned on voting for if Bernie didn‚Äôt get the nomination they answered with Trump.
[comment]If Bernie is nominated trump is in big trouble imo. Anyone else and he easily wins
[comment]Bernie will destroy Trump if Trump doesn't destroy himself first.
[comment]Bernie is the only one who recognizes the dangers of climate change. Elect anyone else and New York will probably go underwater within 20 years. Gives a whole new meaning to Wall Street is sinking

[comment]I don‚Äôt know[comment]It‚Äôs important to point out that every democrat said Trump had no chance of beating Hillary[comment]I think Biden is the only serious candidate. The rest of the communists are just to far to the left.
[comment]Never take that for granted though. No one thought Trump could ever beat Hillary.
[comment]If they nominate Bernie[comment]Bernie is 5 bridges too far
[comment]If you happen to see my F150 and it has a Trump sticker and a Bernie Sanders sticker[comment]I disagree. I think Sanders will be trouble for Trump bec he speaks the same language of appeasing workers and bringing back jobs. Also[comment]If any Democrat faces Trump it's an easy Trump landslide. Biden is corrupt and senile. Talking about kids rubbing his hairy legs at the pool. Warren is full of crap[comment]There‚Äôs only one logical thing to do then! Republican Party should back Bernie to ensure Trump‚Äôs success!
[comment]Trump‚Äôs winning regardless of Democrat at this point.
[comment]I respectfully disagree with the title.  It should be replaced with "If Democrats nominate anyone [comment]I believe the election is a bit too far to make such a claim.
[comment]I can't see Bernie getting the nod. I have a feeling it will either be Biden or Warren. Trump would mop the floor with Bernie. Not to mention Obama has said Bernie is not a Democrat and that he would discourage voters from voting his way if it came to it. It also doesn't look good that he refuses to endorse his own former VP. Either way[comment]It‚Äôs going to be Bloomberg vs Trump
[comment]I‚Äôm afraid Sanders is the most formidable. Vermont is a fairly conservative state and he has won there for decades.
[comment]If they nominate Biden[comment]That would also make AOC the leader of the Democratic party. l doubt Pelosi and Schumer will let it happen.

Do you think anyone aside from him would have been able to stand up to the left commie machine the way he had? Do you know of anyone who was running against him in the primaries on the right who could have taken the amount of abuse he‚Äôs been able to take? And through all of this he‚Äôs been kicking ass and taking names.

And nobody has been better at forcing the left to take off their masks and show themselves for the radical commies and swamp monsters they really are. Many democrat voters are waking up and seeing their own party for the swamp it‚Äôs become. And nobody but Trump could have pulled it off the way he had.

I agree he has been unfairly bashed by the media and the demo-rats witch hunts have been wrong.

He isn‚Äôt anywhere near the leader Reagan or the Bushes were.

He should have more address the nation speeches where he gives status updates directly to the nation.

There was a moment of two weeks where he was taking it seriously but words matter. There is countless evidence that he originally claimed to not believe in the severity and has now as recently as yesterday blamed hospitals for hoarding. 

The amount of mixed information isn't good for maintaining unity with the public and my concern is that he holding his rallies via the the press briefings. Some said that "actions speak louder than words". Sure
Sure the economy is tanking but there are thousands to millions more people or tanking even harder. It feels like he never seems to get that.

He doesn't suggest injecting bleach.

He ends with "let's talk to doctors".

Ugh.
[comment]OMG OK I WAS GONNA POST THIS HERE! But thank you!. My facebook post has been bombarded with fake news from people who more than likely heard it through word of mouth. So I had to watch the actual speech and never did he ever suggest that people inject themselves with lysol but that ‚Äúthey‚Äù the medical professional were looking into a type of disinfectant that could be injected to clear the virus. If people would do their own research and actually watch the announcement they would see that. Unless they have TDS! DJT2020!
[comment]I understand that he was referring to how the UV light is used as the disinfectant.

The reason for the craziness around his statement is how he stated them. He talked about the UV light and his fascination with it. Then paused as if he was going to start his briefing. 

Then he started in about the disinfectant. If he didn't pause or made a connection between the two it is easily understandable that his wording makes it seem like he was suggesting disinfectant products versus the disinfectant delivered by the UV light.

He‚Äôs a disgrace as President and the fact that democrats won‚Äôt hold their own accountable doesn‚Äôt change that.

[comment]So the media and trump acted wrongly. Ok now let‚Äôs move forward. Fuck em both.
[comment]All hail God Emperor Trump!

Don junior for president in 2024!
[comment]I would hope our president would have more information than all these shitty news media outlets. They aren‚Äôt in charge of anything and that‚Äôs the issues with Trump getting his briefings from Fox.  We have to stop listening to these echo chambers and start looking at the facts before we act.
[comment]This is hillarious. Maybe the silver lining here is now that Trump is throwing Fox News under the bus[comment]I too was thinking the flu is worse for lethality but I guess the rona is a lot more contagious. I‚Äôm not afraid of the rona so long as we can get the economy rolling again a S a p 

I‚Äôm a lot slower to blame any single politician than the hysterical media though. There‚Äôs nothing trump could have done that they wouldn‚Äôt try to eat him alive over. 

Lockdown = ‚Äúliterally hitler.‚Äù 
Too lax = ‚Äúpeepil will die becos of u‚Äù
[comment]The media has become the enemy of We the People.
[comment] I don‚Äôt remember who was the guy in dc that said it‚Äôs only 15 cases and soon it will vanish? Wasn‚Äôt the media
[comment]Yeah[comment]Wait[comment]The more they speak the more TRUMP WINS!
[comment]Is there a higher resolution version somewhere? I can‚Äôt read most of these.
[comment]I don't see any News sources I even recognize apart from Fox. Seems like a pretty skewed collage you have there.
[comment]He also didn‚Äôt have the power to shut down the country
[comment]This has been memory holed. Please report to room 101 for re-education.
[comment]Thank you for making this compilation! Saving this gem for later use in anti-Trump threads or comments[comment]Did you know that
More people have died from living on earth than from the Corona virus.
[comment]Yes
On March 9[comment]Cherry picked articles don't accurately represent the overall trend
[comment]And they call themselves essential
[comment]Fake news
[comment]Talk about hand picked stats
[comment]Interesting that most of these sources are right leaning...
[comment]If the left didn‚Äôt have double standards[comment]This is Trump's fault not the media's. Trump republicans are gullible AF.
[comment]If you want to know who is in the pocket of the Chinese Communist Party just listen to who is using Chinese Communist Party talking points verbatim to attack the President of the United States and the American citizens.

When Stalin was purging and starving his citizens the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Hitler was coming to power
Do you see the pattern here?

And today when looking at History looking back at events the Western media rewrites the truth and manufacturing fiction to deny reality and cover up the truth. 

The communist movement has been very busy very active (Wikipedia
Wall Street is the modern-day slave boat owners of old.  They have modernized slavery using the Chinese Communist Party as the plantation owner to provide the slave labour for their profits.  Instead of moving the slaves to the factories they simply moved all the factories out of Western Democracies to Communist China
socalist media publisher run by communists staffed by cultists funded by the oil kingdoms all for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party and Soros Open Society Foundation's Open Border project.
[comment]Yes[comment]It would be nice to actually see the dates of these articles.  I think we were all downplaying the virus up until about a month ago[comment]God this sub is being hardcore brigaded.

[comment]Thank you for making this compilation! Saving this gem for later use in anti-Trump threads or comments[comment]I might actually cash-app someone if they repost this to r/politics
[comment]Do you have to fail an IQ test to be a Republican?
[comment]Media reports what other people say and do. If you disagree with what other people say and do it is not the media that‚Äôs the problem. 

Blaming the messenger is obtuse.

Find an journalist that reports what happened without trying to tell you how to feel about it. That will improve your perspective and balance emotions. 

‚ÄúTrump said this.‚Äù
Or
‚ÄúXi Jing ping did that‚Äù 

The end.

This kind of thing. The commentary that journalists allow themselves these days is detrimental.
[comment]Are we now letting media headlines decide on how a leader should govern a nation?  


I get that journalism has now been muddied but this should not be used as a shield to avoid people in power for being accountable for their inaction.
[comment]"making action" Lol
[comment]Good job referencing mostly right wing media outlets lol

[title]Andrew Yang[selftext]https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/andrew-yang-tech-entrepreneur-fears-automation-self-driving-cars/[comment]Does anyone else think the recent surge in left leaning media regarding Yang reeks of fear?
[comment]Going back to the cotton gin[comment]He wants everyone to be a machine of the government. Just like Gabbard[comment]I like how the article points to self driving vehicles putting truckers out of work. Airplanes have been able to fly themselves for the past decade[comment]Make America Math Again
[comment]Not a fan of UBIBut if it would serve as a replacement of other welfare programs
Milton Friedman talked about a negative income tax[comment]Yang's proposals fall apart without basically re-writing the constitution.

He was asked in a youtube video about how UBI would effect rental prices in places with already high rent.

His response was that with UBI people will move to rural
You can't change zoning at the national level
His plans make no real economic or practical sense once you go beyond a real base level.
[comment]Isn‚Äôt that called welfare and food stamps?
[comment]Yang has literally devoted his career to solving problems that affect ordinary Americans and he‚Äôs continuing to do so in an even bigger way as a candidate for president. That‚Äôs not the profile of a so-called snake oil salesman.
[comment]&gt; "[Yang] predicts that in a few years
This is one of those progressive talking points which carries with it a planetarily sized load of irony. Democrats and many of the President's critics frequently denigrate him by telling us he's a fear-monger and that's how he gets by.

...yet almost the entirety of the Democrats' economic platform is anchored to the idea that society is operating under the looming threat of an unprecedented destruction of jobs. To quote Jeff Bezos: "...we are so unimaginative about what future jobs are going to look like and what they are going to be."

And just like how Henry Ford quipped that if he had asked what someone would've wanted to get around more quickly
In the dawn of internet-based journalism
There've been times throughout history where scientists
Democrats like Yang are taking the position that long-term employment is under threat[comment]Man[comment]Vegas has Yang at 12-1[comment]Do you get more money living in California because the gas is so high
[comment]No[comment]I don‚Äôt know what is surprising about any of this. Democrats know people want free shit[comment]I only support UBI if it's a *replacement* of our horribly inept and corrupt welfare system
IMO UBI is more transparent than the cobbled together joke we have right now concerning welfare.
[comment]All the Dems are snake oil salesmen
[comment]I like UBI as a replacement[comment]I love how r/republican is so astroturfed that the upvoted comments *support* Yang and UBI<|startoftext|>
[title]President Trump promised a fast vaccine; this is the fastest vaccine creation in human history. Human trials begin today.
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/mdudxpmkq4n41.jpg[comment]Hoping this vaccine works. My country will be hit hard by the virus. Good work Mr Trump
[comment]*You know[comment]Hell frickin yeah
[comment]I hope it works[comment]If the vaccine works[comment]how true is this? I can't seem to find this anywhere?

I know Germany started testing for a vaccine
[comment]I always thought vaccines took 5 or even 10+ years to develope. I'd be surprised if this one works
[comment]A: Do you really think Trump ordering a vaccine be made is the sole reason why it happened?
B: This is in Seattle[comment]When they told me about the vaccine trials today
NPR reminded me that it‚Äôs not the same as other vaccines and it‚Äôs still a long way off before we can all have them and the president was wrong.
[comment]Is there an article? This is just a screenshot.
[comment]Thats so awesome! I can't wait for this to be over! I'm a wedding videographer and I had 3 clients calling me telling me their wedding's are cancelled. And the thing is I don't feel right keeping their whole deposit even thou this is my main source of income. This year sucks for business people.
[comment]First Clinical trial = vaccine??? Vaccines AT LEAST a year away and that would be absolutely crazy fast. Also Trump owns moderna???
[comment]I sincerely hope a fast and successful safe vaccine is available. I‚Äôm old enough to remember the swine flu of 1976[comment]Honest question. If a company in Massachusetts developed this[comment]Isn't vaccination a libtard Democrat scheme to make white Christians' children autistic?
[comment]That seems odd.

Trump recently tried to buy the german company CureVac because they are working on an antidote. Trump was planning to use this antidote exclusively for Amierica.  
But the company told him to go fck himself
[comment]Ride Trump a little harder
[comment]Get to fuck[comment]I hope USA finds the vaccine first. That should put eurofags and democrats to their place.
[comment]Fingers crossed it works.
[comment]Will be quick but expect 12 months before we see a vaccine. Clinical trials take years
[comment]Wait[comment]He‚Äôs doing a phenomenal job with this.
[comment]its just a phase 1 trial. No real efficacy data is expected from this study.

Its basically a test on healthy ppl to see if this vaccine is safe 
TBH

When they start large phase 3 trials[comment]The vaccine won't be ready until people are looked at one year in the future at least because they may have unknown side effects. Hopefully they get it right and these people trying it become immune.

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/40z97vsyzin41.jpg[comment]They will just say they didn't get it. Just like the tax cuts they got.
[comment]This sucks. Didnt know donald was a socialist
[comment]It's not the President's money....
[comment]1. It's not the President's money either.
2. My congressman are voting for it so it's really like 538 people sending money out.
3. I'll end up paying for it in the end anyway.

Dumb meme is dumb.
[comment]As hypocritical as that is[comment]Dear Trump Supporters: Don't be accepting that money that he sends out...remember Socialism is Evil.
[comment]Everyone against socialism should also reject this money.
[comment]Might have to buy a nice rifle with that money
[comment]I‚Äôve seen so many comments here with diverging view points that I don‚Äôt even know what to say myself.
[comment]I‚Äôm actually not okay with federal aid. I get the dire circumstances but I was raised to earn what you get. If I get a check[comment]Hey Trump lover. Don't accept the money he sends out.. Remember. It is socialist to spread the money arround and you havn't worked for it. /s  


Seriously though. Why are you americans always looking from one side at things and trying to figth eachother. Maybe remember you are not each others enemy...
[comment]Every check should come with a "Trump 2020" sticker.
[comment]There are no republicans in this thread any way.
[comment]And here I thought a giant pandemic that affects and treats everyone the same
How dumb of me ...
[comment]This is immature
There are real worries about devaluing the dollar. 

There are serious problems with the way our nation is setup[comment]It's not his money either[comment]He made us all suffer why wouldn‚Äôt I get paid for it?
[comment]Its socialist to give out money! I don‚Äôt expect any GOP to accepr
[comment]Better than Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äòfree stuff‚Äô that we‚Äôd still be paying for with 90% of our income for the rest of our lives.
[comment]Why are we handing out money for no reason again?
[comment]Yea get over it[comment]This really almost has 1k upvotes. Conservatives really are pathetic

[comment]A socialist president would hand out money to Republicans[comment]#still their tax dollars

[comment]Watch Frank Zappa 1966   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFVwohXMgmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFVwohXMgmQ)

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm about to get sick

From watchin' my TV

Been checkin' out the news

Until my eyeballs fail to see

I mean to say that every day

Is just another rotten mess

And when it's gonna change
Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot...

I seen the cops out on the street

Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff

And chokin' in the heat

Listened to reports

About the whisky passin' 'round

Seen the smoke &amp; fire

And the market burnin' down

Watched while everybody

On his street would take a turn

To stomp and smash and bash and crash

And slash and bust and burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Well you can cool it
You can heat it...

'Cause
Take your TV tube and eat it

'N all that phony stuff on sports

'N all the unconfirmed reports

You know I watched that rotten box

Until my head began to hurt

From checkin' out the way

The newsmen say they get the dirt

Before the guys on channel so-and-so

And further they assert

That any show they'll interrupt

To bring you news if it comes up

They say that if the place blows up

They'll be the first to tell

Because the boys they got downtown

Are workin' hard and doin' swell
And if anybody gets the news

Before it hits the street
They say that no one blabs it faster

Their coverage can't be beat

And if another woman driver

Gets machine-gunned from her seat

They'll send some joker with a brownie

And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Hey you know something people

I'm not black

But there's a whole lots a times

I wish I could say I'm not white

Well
And the local people turnin'

On the merchants and the shops

Who used to sell their brooms and mops

And every other household item

Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em

And they say it served 'em right

Because a few of them are white
And it's the same across the nation

Black &amp; white discrimination

They're yellin' "; You can't understand me!";

And all the other crap they hand me

In the papers and TV

'N all that mass stupidity

That seems to grow more every day

Each time you hear some nitwit say

He wants to go and do you in

Because the color of your skin

Just don't appeal to him

(No matter if it's black or white)

Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we gotta sit around at home

And watch this thing begin

But I bet there won't be many left

To see it really end

'Cause the fire in the street

Ain't like the fire in my heart

And in the eyes of all these people

Don't you know that this could start

On any street in any town

In any state if any clown

Decides that now's the time to fight

For some ideal he thinks is right

And if a million more agree

There ain't no great society

As it applies to you and me

Our country isn't free

And the law refuses to see

If all that you can ever be

Is just a lousy janitor

Unless your uncle owns a store

You know that five in every four

Just one amount and nothin' more

Don't watch the rats go across the floor

And make up songs about being poor

Blow you harmonica son!
[comment]No. Please.  Stop.
[comment]Something people need to be aware of is that rioters don't care about Floyd or any other victim of police brutality.  They don't care about race or injustices or inequality.  They are violent criminals who just look for an excuse to vandalize and do violence.  Rioters simply want to riot
Do no let these idiots ever convince you that they give a damn about human life[comment]CNN wanted a riot and pushed for a riot only thing is CNN wanted somebody else to be targeted.
[comment]What would make them target CNN? They seek "truth" from them. Did they side with the former officer or something?

The moment a protest crosses the threshold of violence or destruction. It‚Äôs not a protest. MLK god rest his soul is rolling in his grave.

[comment]They have started here in Richmond[comment]It amuses me all the people posting about how peaceful protest haven't changed anything. Which is why they're rioting now.

has violent riots ever change the hearts of people so they don't hate anymore?

the only thing that will stop racism is time and people changing. 

And the only thing that'll change police involved shootings. Is less crime so the police don't feel the need to reach for their guns so fast.

She is a bubble headed wind bag who can be ignored
[comment]this is some deep thinking chess moves from the far left

1. promote ignorance of COVID contagiousness thus increasing the amount infected

2. MSM flip rhetoric with hyper fear over disease

3. state POTUS was wrong not MSM for lack of immediate and complete solution to problem

4. instill division through race relations by connecting disease to racism 

5. make POC so scared they dont seek treatment thus adding to death toll

6. added death toll supports claim that the POTUS is racist

This comes off a MSN (not FOX) report.

[comment]She‚Äôs not just a communist. She‚Äôs an asshole communist. BU should be ashamed of themselves for giving her an Economics degree.
[comment]That‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs been overdramatic black people being racist to Asian people.

&amp;#x200B;

If we weren't there in the first place[comment]Did some people in Iran do something that you didn't like Ilhan Omar? Because we know that she's anti-American.
[comment]Some people did something[comment]Talk about impeachment.....in the real world we would start with her..then deportation!
[comment]Some people did something. No big deal.
[comment]Wait. Hundreds of Americans ? Why am I just now hearing about this...
[comment]I can‚Äôt help but think she is brain damaged and brain washed. A dangerous combination in reality but in DC she‚Äôs become a DEM favorite
[comment]Some guy killed some guy[comment]I just want to make sure my head is screwed on straight. Can you guys fact check me?

1) Solemani was the head of the Revolutionary Guard
2) [The Revolutionary Guard has killed hundreds
3) [Solemani literally just orchestrated an attack on Americans
4) [The Iranian government is massacring it's people left and right. WHY ARE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THEM!?!?!?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_Iranian_protests)
[comment]That‚Äôs cuz she‚Äôs with the Iranians
[comment]Act like something good is outrageous and people sort of believe you because they think
THATS whats outrageous.
[comment]Of course she is!
[comment]Of course she is. Because she is a snake
[comment]The more she talks the more it‚Äôs clear she hates America
[comment]The outrage from Democrats is so ridiculous.  You can't make this stuff up. Acting like they hope President Trump starts a war[comment]Why are terrorists being elected into U.S. government?
[comment]To quote Ilhan Omar[comment]Didn't we rescue this woman's family?
[comment]Omar should move to Iran and help those people.

Then it goes to the Senate
Pelosi was smart[comment]Honestly ‚Äúimpeached by democrats‚Äù would be a killer campaign slogan for Trump.
[comment]You know that Babylonbee is a satire site[comment]Uh babylonbee?
[comment]"Well
If that isn't the funniest shit Nancy has every said in regards to Trumps presidential term then i don't know what it. LMAO. I don't think any democrat knew how to respond to that. It won't pass in the senate however. They would need all democratic[comment]I'm not a fan of what he said during the call[comment]The article is from a new satire website... It‚Äôs not a real article.
[comment]Sadly[comment]The fact that this article hit the top of r/ republican without folks even noticing it was satire just made my morning.
[comment]Everyone seems to dismiss the fact that Sleepy Joe bragged on National TV about something that appears to have a serious conflict of interest. Trump asked for Ukraine to look into Biden‚Äôs claims. Just because he is running for President doesn‚Äôt make him immune from investigation
Creepy Joe has opened a can of worms and Impeachment is a weak attempt to shift the focus off Biden
It appears to have had the opposite effect
We shall see
[comment]Tbh[comment]As long as we stray away from the overwhelming evidence that there was wrongdoing[comment]Watch out[comment]You guys do realise that the babylon bee is a sarcastic news website like the Onion. This is not real.

Sorry if it is a dumb question. Little out of the loop on this.
[comment]On a positive note[comment]
Interesting seeing Democrats burning down a Democrat city that is run by a Democrat mayor with a Democrat police chief of color
[comment]Nazifa won‚Äôt wake up. Find them[comment]Now you care about homeless people?
[comment]The people who watched this happen said that it was an Infowars group that coordinated the attack to make antifa look bad

[comment]get out the national guard with some tear gas and sort the rabble out
[comment]Antifa[comment]ANTIFA AKA the Democrats Black Shirts[comment]Antifa isn‚Äôt an organized group ... as much as a set of beliefs and a mission. To blame antifa is to blame a set of beliefs and missions.
[comment]Hasn't this been conclusively proven to have been done by Infowars people?

[comment]I will assassinate donal trumpf
[comment]Don't fall for it.  Bull Moose candidate.
[comment]She still wants to ban semi-automatic rifles as "weapons of war" in spite of her actually knowing that they aren't. She has no integrity.
[comment]She's the only one I would take over Trump.
[comment]Her and Yang are the only ones with a chance to beat Trump[comment]Notice she gave out her website address this time[comment]The Left hates her because she isn't full of hate.
[comment]Wow a Democrat acknowledging our coexistence as Americans. Very rare but a nice change of pace
[comment]She was the most likable out of all of them
[comment]I like that she's dividing the Dems and throwing out red pills. Yes[comment]Liberals can't stand people that aren't interested in burning all Conservatives at the stake. They want an insane socialist who will take everyone's guns and have a quota on abortions every week. 

If they didn't[comment]Only candidate that could beat Trump and they wont elect her.
[comment]I will not vote Democratic in 2020[comment]I see a gun grabbing nazi[comment]She‚Äôs singing a different tune now.  But still a communist.
[comment]First let me say I'm a Democrat. I'm here after searching reddit and trying to understand the backlash I'm hearing regarding her in the media. 

Out of all the candidates
Now to see all the hate being thrown her way
Long story short[comment]She might be the most sane and least socialist of the bunch but she's still left on all her issues and I imagine like most dems she would go much further left once in office. Trump 2020.
[comment]Tulsi is a decent person. I don‚Äôt feel that way about any other democratic candidate.
[comment]Pls upvote me so I can continue to post on socialist led subreddits.
[comment]Mom üòçüòçüòçüòç

Things she supports that are crazy:
1.Federal minimum wage increased to $15 per hour
2.Supports reparations.
3.College should be free.
4.Eliminate the electoral college.
5.Close down nuclear power plants.
6."Assault weapon" ban.
7.Government sponsored universal health care.
8.Expanding DACA.
9.Supports more stringent "climate change" legislations.

Things she supports that aren't crazy:
1.Negotiating prices for Medicare.
2.Stoping the spying of the US government on it's citizens.
3.Ending the war on drugs.
[comment]Aaaaand cancelled.
[comment]It‚Äôs amazing how much politics has changed in the last ten or so years. Heck I was a Democrat until 2016. The insanity that the Party showed during those elections and this next one is crazy and pushed people like me away from the party.
[comment]‚Äú...that I want to disarm and make vulnerable to future incoming Democrat voters.‚Äù
-Gabbard[comment]Lol look at her now trying to cuddle up to Republicans
[comment]I like her but yang is so awkward. Nobody‚Äôs raising their hands when he tells them to. When he hits the mic it‚Äôs just weird and really uncomfortable.
[comment]I like her more and more. I mean aside from the completely venal[comment]She should switch parties.
[comment]She's the only candidate that doesn't always sound like a blithering idiot.
[comment]She is the least corrupt of the dems
[comment]The only democrat worthy of our time to listen to. The rest are bar shit insane.
[comment]Great rhetoric! I love it from either side of the aisle. When there is disagreement[comment]People can trying to portray her as the most reasonable Democrat in the room[comment]Good for her. If she rolls back a few other things she‚Äôs said she‚Äôll easily be my favorite Dem candidate
[comment]Honestly she‚Äôs the only candidate I‚Äôm worried about. She‚Äôs the only one who would have a chance in hell of beating Trump.

[comment]JFC why don't we just let people figure that out with their doctors. I mean I agree and have similar concerns[comment]If they can get cosmetic surgery then tatoos should also be legal under the age of 18.
[comment]The potential for mistakes is too great and permanent to allow this.  Let the child make the decision when his mind and body are fully matured.
[comment]Agreed.

Also I think it should be illegal to give children fast food or pop if they are already obese üëçüèª
[comment]It's sad that this is a partisan issue or even being debated at all.  The best quote I've seen yet about this is[comment]It should socially unacceptable[comment]Illegal as hell. 

Its child abuse and borders on pedo-like mentality. 

I dont know how we recover from this.
[comment]If gay conversion therapy is illegal[comment]Reminds me of when the pedos wanted to spread that STD vaccine[comment]The child has rights too
[comment]Based
[comment]I‚Äôve actually started writing a bill that outlaws this.
[comment] Should be allowed only in extreme cases.
[comment]And it should be illegal to brainwash a child into thinking he‚Äôs a girl...
[comment]You can't drink until your 21 and you can't serve in the military until you are 18 (17 in some cases). 

Yet you are allowed to change your gender at the age of 7?! 

Insane! 
You shouldn't be allowed to do shit until your 18 because you are a KID figuring life out.
[comment]So for dems its quite alright to do this BS[comment]part of the problem is people like us don't speak our mind often enough and as loud as it should be said. this world has lost its mind!
[comment]It's criminal that we've even sunk so low that we are even having conversations like this.
[comment]Yes[comment]This is the James Younger Case if I‚Äôm not mistaken
[comment]I agree.
[comment]What an edgy post! Can you believe people don‚Äôt want to inject chemicals that cause permanent physical changes to their kids development?
[comment]Absolutely
[comment]Why stop there? Lets let them drink[comment]I always look at articles I read from the right and the left with scrutiny. I can‚Äôt find any evidence in this case to suggest that a pediatrician or an endocrinologist would sanction gender changing medication. Does someone have any evidence to suggest otherwise?
[comment]It should be up to the parent. The government doesn't know better than the individual[comment]Forcing a kid to be a gender they're not is qualified as child abuse in my state. It should be everywhere.
[comment]It Should Be Illegal To Give Transgender Hormones And Surgery*

ftfy
[comment]Legal age should be 18 if at all
[comment]The left has gone completely insane

[comment]Immigrants shouldn't even be immigrants[comment]Technically illegal and legal immigrants are not allowed to use social services
In the process of becoming a legal citizen
Problem is that the government doesn‚Äôt pursue these people who go on welfare or food stamps cause it‚Äôs not worth their time/money
[comment]Nobody should be on welfare.  

Charity &gt; coercion.
[comment]And non-veterans
[comment]What if private charity isn‚Äôt enough to sustain people like the disabled or orphans or the severely mentally ill?
[comment]10-4
[comment]All people getting government assistance should be required to do something for the public. Even people on disability can do something.

[comment]Public charge is the law[comment]Yeah I agree
[comment]Any illegal can get a fraudulent social security number.
[comment]Immigrants shouldnt be here at all
[comment]Nobody should be one welfare! Conservatives need to understand this. It incentives poor decision making while penalizing responsibility.

[comment]Neither should banks &amp; corporations

[comment]Well I pay my taxes and I know why society is better for it. I if lawmakers would value human life over being afraid of immigrants and he poor then we might actually move forward as human beings.

[comment]Ok so let's do something about cops killing our citizens of all races.
[comment]Yeah
&amp;#x200B;

Looks like Novembers going to be a breeze.
[comment]Yeah[comment]You're statistically more likely to be killed by a cop if you're white than if you're black. This whole "it's open season on blacks for cops" is such bullshit and it's blatantly obvious
[comment]Wow and no riots[comment]Expect whites down burn down entire cities when it happens
[comment]The problem is far bigger than just race. Race is the excuse many of these dirtbags use to hide their culpability.

Remind me again[comment]Its not just black people protesting. I really hope people see that.
[comment]Only in this case there were no riots. No reportage. No looting. No protests. No nothing. Why? Because he was white. I am sick and fuckin tired of the Caucasian race being trampled on or fought against or ignored. If we‚Äôre all to coexist peacefully together then all lives matter[comment]Nothing new. So what about the tens of thousands of innocent people murdered annually due to gang violence? That's ok right? That doesn't deserve any reaction or critical attention? More people lose their life prematurely due to gang violence than police brutality could ever touch. And this has been a trend for decades. 

I know people will want a source so this is statistical value for one location in one year. Long story short. 700+ murdered

White people are expected to die and be forgotten.
That's why these things come and go.

Until we start doing the same shit
That[comment]So my question is[comment]An attack on one group of citizens is an attack on all of us. It doesn‚Äôt matter who is suffering unjustly. If there is unjust suffering then it needs to be taken care of. We had wars about this
Don‚Äôt let anyone divide us !
[comment]Privatize law enforcement along with everything else.
[comment]We can now deduce that cops have no regard for human life
[comment]Do you guys remember when we rioted in the streets after Tony Timpa‚Äôs death? Yeah[comment]I find it very telling that this is posted on r/republican and also reposted from r/libertarian
[comment]Police brutality is a real thing[comment]This is not a movement about black lives mattering more. 

Black lives matter *enough* to address the lethal culture creeping through law enforcement unchecked. 

There are a few bad cops that abuse their power and are acting as judge
I don‚Äôt agree with looting and burning and violence. But I completely agree with the protests and the messaging. 

There are good cops but they failed to reform a system that is killing people.

This is not 1984
Seriously
I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt open the economy. I said from day 1 that quarantines were unsustainable financially and would wreck the economy. I also said I didn‚Äôt think the death rate was anywhere near 3.4%. 

But the fact remains that it is highly contagious and overruns hospitals. Go look up what happened in Albany Ga. That‚Äôs what will happen if we do absolutely nothing. 

And my point is that there are many conservatives who advocating for exactly that - go back to the way it was before with zero precautions. That‚Äôs a very stupid mindset.

"Democrats Would Rather Blame Trump Than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
[comment]It‚Äôs probably because they have ties to China
[comment]I would love to see Trump do and say the opposite of what he really wants. Just to see the Libs attack his view. Then say you know what[comment]They could have done much more sooner
[comment]The American people have very little control over China. We can point out the failings of Xi and his authoritarian regime but there is very little recourse for us. 

Trump is the head of the US government and his response has been poor. We as Americans have the ability to change our own government and therefore[comment]I identify myself as a democrat but seeing people blaming everything on Trump instead of recognising that China and WHO should take most of the responsibilities on the pandemic hurts my brain
[comment]On January 24[comment]It really shows how terrible they are. Just the fact that they would rather throw blame around rather than help fix the issue.

[comment]"Remind me who the facists are..."

People on all sides.
[comment]I live in California. I have many ultra liberal friends.  


I do not doubt this happens AT ALL. It is just surprising sometimes because I have mayyyyyybe met 1 or 2 people that were this zealous in their political beliefs to take things that far.
[comment]Can‚Äôt come out as an ‚ÄúR‚Äù word in CA.  Can‚Äôt wear Red hats or put stickers on your car or else vandalized.  Get called racist even though you‚Äôre a minority.  Tolerant non violent left.
[comment]I‚Äôm sorry if this guy is having troubles socializing and private life matters(kids
...but losing major clients and countless projects? It doesn‚Äôt sound like you ‚Äúcame out as a republican‚Äù. It sounds like you are actively injecting politics into your business dealings

[comment]I left Ca about 9 years ago[comment]‚ÄúCome out as a republican‚Äù what the fuck does that even mean lol. I knew Califoria was shit but damn.

[comment]You just live in the wrong county. That's all. For example[comment]Usually when  see Republicans on Facebook[comment]In the past both Dems and Reps annoyed me but now days its definitely the left. I might not agree with evething on the right but at least they are not bat shit crazy like the left
[comment]None if that behavior strikes me as particularly fascistic. It fulfills many qualities of it but appears to lack nationalism. It looks more like aggressive tribalism than an attitude of fascism.
[comment]Victim complex

We‚Äôll beat them again and they‚Äôll still be screaming into the sky and petting their baby llamas[comment]I keep a very low profile in SoCal. I avoid political discussions with people I know and just let my vote do the talking.
[comment]I was talking with a girl and we were going to meet soon.  Everything was going so well and I liked her. I knew she was a Liberal
She made a comment about how she hoped the dems could impeach trump and referenced Ukraine so I brought up Uncle Joe.  

She confirmed I was Republican and said "I don't associate with Trump supporters."  

I don't understand the people who live in their bubble and avoid people who arent Liberal.   It blows my mind.
[comment]It's all good. Just pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
[comment]Move man
[comment]I am sorry to hear about the treatment you and your family are receiving. Stay safe! If people bring it up I always throw out the law of the 3 unmentionable topics in public. No talk of sex[comment]this is genuinely gut wrenching
[comment]I'm personally a Democrat[comment]Its crazy!!!! A guy I met here basically thinks this way. If you support trump you're a racist... it's like what?! I really want to move out when I can! Maybe to a swing state and help flip it Red just because..

[comment]It's so disappointing to see you guys look at yet another issue as us vs them. Both "sides" have valid points. Both "sides" have made mistakes. You're loyal to a political party instead of your fellow humans. Feckless

Edit: thank you for the gold. We are in this together[comment]Truth!
[comment]‚ÄúThe political beliefs of our mayor directly impact our decision to be shitty violent looters!‚Äù - said nobody in this entire country

[comment]A majority of the riots are happening in heavy liberal cities. I'll never understand why they blame Republicans and conservative for the racism when so many of these incidents happen in their own backyards.
[comment]Yes it's all because of two different political parties. Thank you clarifying[comment]Hope they had an FAA permit for that... Flying with text is FAA regulated.

[comment]i love it !
[comment]Got that right my state of commie Cal is about as corrupt and lawless as they come thanks to the Democrats. I live just North of Fresno Cal a few years ago the second in command at the Fresno PD was a Black man who was arrested and charged with drug running. Fresno is a major drug distribution hub for the Mexican mafia for California. The illegal alien gangs in Fresno run rampant. When I first moved here it was common to read in the Fresno newspaper about dead burnt bodies being found in farm fields at least twice a week.
[comment]I mean yes to this post but our President also decided to throw fuel on this fire and then proceed to do literally nothing.

Just don‚Äôt look at your watch
Clarify: for the record[comment]hahaha I love this! It's gonna be Blackie Joe and Shamu Abrams. Good luck with that. America will not vote for that combination if you catch my drift.

[title]Joe Rogan: 'I'd rather vote for Trump' than Biden
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-rogan-id-rather-vote-for-trump-than-biden[comment]We agree Rogan. Trump isn‚Äôt perfect but Biden would be a disaster and ultimately you would be voting for his VP to take over as president as he‚Äôs not even mentally fit now let alone in 2021 and beyond.
[comment]Joe Rogan also would rather vote for Bernie Sanders
[comment]It‚Äôs an easy decision for most of us.  I‚Äôve always been on the fence between left and right.. I doubt I‚Äôll ever vote again after these last 4 years. They really are some crazy mofos[comment]The Democrat party is not equipped to rule America. There are fundamental flaws in the system that they used in picking their candidate. Remember how the Iowa primary was a complete clusterfuck?
[comment]Rogan is an idiot. He knows nothing about politics and wavers every time he brings on a guest that gets him hard. Dudes just playing the game.
[comment]He might have actually grown a brain.
[comment]Joe was going to respond to this[comment]Shhhh[comment]Finally[comment]I thought I felt an earthquake yesterday... Now I know what was it. Boom!
[comment]Hell yeah! If Biden became President we'd see at least 10 million unemployed and Thousands of deaths. Not like prepared President Trump!
[comment]either way i‚Äôm not a fan of him and have never been
[comment]Hes still stupid for thinking Bernie Sanders is a good candidate
[comment]That isn‚Äôt really saying much. Anyone with a brain can see Biden is out to lunch mentally
[comment]I think I figured out why sleepy Joe seems so off; the DNC had to scoop out part of his brains to install the remote control.
[comment]Just because somebody has a microphone in front of his face doesn't make them intelligent[comment]Because Joe Rogan is a disgusting person who sometimes cloaks it.

[comment]This is the same guy who said he'd vote for Bernie Sanders[comment]HAHA. Honestly[comment]Bernie Sanders is a spoiled stupid old man who's political beliefs are literally not figurative literally the closest this to nazi Germany. Socialism has never worked and it will never work. And if I do make a bunch of money I'm not paying 81 percent in taxes I've move and take my money with me
[comment]As someone who has worked in the senior living industry for years[comment]Every Bernie supporter would vote Trump or not at all...
[comment]He said he would vote for Whoopi Goldberg before he voted for Biden and he would vote for Hilary as well. He‚Äôs a liberal with some conservative values.

[comment]Here is how it will go down if they cover illegals

1.) Democrats believe in open borders.
2.) Instead of paying for expensive treatments themselves3.) All thru the border state4.) Once treated and healthy5.) The tax payers are played for a fool.

Re: border - While some far-left dems believe in open borders

[comment]I‚Äôm surprised trump hasn‚Äôt put an end to money towards PP[comment]this isn't new--they've been spending money on politics and elections for years. They do it through their Super Pac. it's legal because they do it through the super pac and other 501c4 entities
[comment]It's legal because there are distinct[comment]Isn't this kind of argument a logical fallacy? This would be the same if the Feds gave money to a teacher's unions or a nonprofit that helps to feed the hungry and they then use donations they get (not the money the feds give them) to help fund elections to support candidates that would help support them to get even more funding for teachers or food banks?   


Also[comment]We did it...its simple. Citizens United made A merica political donation crack heads...

[comment]It shouldn‚Äôt be legal[comment]Planned parenthood should be defunded and everyone there should be thrown out to live on the streets. 

Abortion is wrong. And benefiting financially from abortion is even worse. Using that money to influence the political outcome of an election is just sickening. Burn it all down.
[comment]If i ever ran for office as a Republican I would spend all my time talking about abortion while waving a gun on stage and I would probably get elected.

Both organizations have a separate entity that operates from private donations that they use for political purposes[comment]It's about to get even more legal if Trump and the GOP get rid of the Johnson Amendment which keeps 501c3 organizations from directly or indirectly intervening amd participating in in any political campaign.

[title]Democrats Lie About Coronavirus To Attack Trump. Their Policies Could Make Fighting Pandemics More Difficult.

[comment]I seriously can‚Äôt believe Elizabeth Warren wants to divert funding for the ‚Äúracist‚Äù wall to fight the coronavirus. How exactly does an open border policy help contain and control the outbreak???
[comment]These same idiots defended Obama when he refused to ban flights from Liberia during the Ebola outbreak.
[comment]Liberals are scum.
[comment]Yeah I don't know about that. M4A and paid time off for all would definitely help in this situation.
[comment]Is this a parity article?  No one thinks people want this thing to get out of control for political reasons.  Maybe the whitehouse is trying to get ahead of this by sending out this propaganda?
[comment]What exactly were the lies? Who knows what this could become. People just want it taken seriously. I think trump's initial downplay of coronavirus was to try to keep people and the markets from overreacting. 

But the fact that I saw people denying this is even a threat to try to make libs look stupid is probably the stupidest thing I have seen in a while. Fuck politics let's just pray it doesnt get out of control more than it has.
[comment]I feel like coronavirus is a punishment for all Trump's sins.
[comment]Trump is attempting to cut funding from the CDC[comment]It should tell you how evil at their very core the left is.  They will legitimately work as hard as they can to see people suffer or die just to achieve the tiniest political victories.

[comment]In the interests of debate
#  What's True

The Trump administration's proposed 2021 budget includes cuts to the CDC's activities related to chronic disease. (ED: This is not set in stone
 It is also true that in 2018 the Trump administration fired key officials connected to the U.S. pandemic response
# What's False

Congress hasn't approved the budget

What‚Äôs bugging me is the absolute void of media coverage. The most significant coverage we‚Äôve gotten was Google Play store removing the episode of Larry King with the call. I read the Times

[title]Study: 96% of Biologists Agree Life Begins at Fertilization
[selftext]https://politifeed.net/news/study-96-of-biologists-agree-life-begins-at-fertilization[comment]Yes it does
[comment]REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[comment]Life begins before fertilization. Both the egg and the sperm are living.

Are they sentient beings? No.
[comment]20 years ago[comment]The sad thing is that most know it‚Äôs starts at fertilization[comment]WOW 96% of scientists agree that climate change...oops...I mean...life begins at conception.
[comment]Here's the actual study.  Chapter 5 is the relevant section.  The questions asked start on page 240.  It's an interesting read.
https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/1883

What the headline alludes to is that 96% of respondents agreed with one or more of the following statements:

1. Implicit Statement: ‚ÄúThe end product of mammalian fertilization is a fertilized egg (‚Äòzygote‚Äô)2. Implicit Statement: ‚ÄúThe development of a mammal begins with fertilization3. Implicit Statement: ‚ÄúA mammal's life begins at fertilization4. Explicit Statement: ‚ÄúIn developmental biology5. Explicit Statement: ‚ÄúFrom a biological perspective
Statement 5 was the most contentious of these statements.  It was affirmed by 69% of respondents
85% of the respondents were pro-choice[comment]Here is the thing[comment]Keep your evangelical bs out of government it's the same shit as sharia law
[comment]So with your logic the day after pill is murder?  That‚Äôs an asinine statement.  Besides scientists all agree that life came from the Big Bang so does this mean we quote science only when it fits our narrative?
[comment]I am not a republican or even a conservative in the slightest[comment]When does life without the boot heel of a government agent begin?
[comment]I‚Äôm from the UK and just recently Northern Ireland have passed a law that makes it legal to have an abortion up to 28 weeks. That basically means that a baby that is touching 7 months old can now be legally aborted. I think that‚Äôs awful but there‚Äôs nothing you can do. You just have to accept it at this point because the progressives always get their way. I can understand the reasoning for abortion when the baby is in its very early stages but when it‚Äôs touching 7 months old I don‚Äôt see how you can justify it unless the baby or mother‚Äôs health is seriously compromised.
[comment]I'm ok[comment]Abortion is simply a selfish act in almost every case
An argument I see is that it isn‚Äôt the fathers choice because he doesn‚Äôt carry it for 9 months.  That‚Äôs BS
What if the father was okay with having another child? It‚Äôs his kid as well[comment]99% of biologists agree there ARE ONLY 2 FLAMING GENDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
[comment]People no longer give a shit because its not convenient. I remember having an argument with a dude who tried to make it an autonomy argument[comment]Here‚Äôs the big one I can‚Äôt understand:

Scientists are now doing the In Vitro Fertilization with genetic screening of embryos to choose the gender or likeliness to have blue eyes
Then just as ready to kill that amazing thing at 9 months. 

Scientists see the beginning of life amazing and see all the DNA code and unique information in each one. Work so hard to make life happen and then work so hard to make sure they can kill them just as easy.
[comment]x% of scientist say what the left wants about climate change
Just goes to prove one thing.  The left doesn't know anything about or care anything about actual science.  Don't ever let them tell you otherwise.

[comment]This just proves what alot of folks have been saying....the Dems don't care whether or not the country fails.  They just want rid of Trump.  There is no "dealing" with a group like this.  Failure plays into their hands and they can get a "socialist utopia" they dream of.
[comment]How are you so sure that the corporations who employ Americans will spend the money in our best interest? There is a clear argument against this bill saying that corporations can still still lay off employees while taking bailout money. It‚Äôs being called a slush fund because they are loose rules on how it‚Äôs spent. I‚Äôm wary of that sort of thing[comment]Democrats are f\*\*king a\*\*holes.

They are only there because its free and it's the next step.  It will just become high school 2.0.

Warren:

&gt; Warren has said she would pay for the plan
&gt; She even said she'd do so on her first day in the White House
&gt; she would act **without waiting for Congress** because the Secretary of Education can ‚Äúuse its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs.‚Äù (emp mine)

Am I in a weird timeline where we are currently watching the Senate snore through an impeachment process of a quite flimsy interpretation of what the president can or cannot do with foreign policy while a presidential candidate (who is currently sitting in judgement of her political rival) campaigns on violating the constitution "day 1"?

[comment]There's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. As far as college tuition. The answer isn't to lay the burden on tax otters to pay off other peoples school loans. The answer is to force colleges to charge fair tuition and lower it substantially.  One way to do it is for the government to limit the amount they lend for school loans. Cap it at $12k/year. Colleges will have to adjust or have empty classes. 
As far as Healthcare for all. It never works. We had a better system before Obamacare.  Everybody that worked had decent insurance through their employer. Though that didn't could go to various county hospitals that didn't charge. I live near Chicago. We have Cook County hospital. They provide service to anybody[comment]I am all for people getting healthcare and being able to afford college. But nothing in this world is free.

[comment]That is just sad. I can't even come up with anything more.
[comment]I dislike articles that misrepresent polls like this.

&gt;The poll asked 1

‚Ä¢ Indiana University: Seems kinda silly to be proud about something I had zero control over.

‚Ä¢ University of Houston: I‚Äôm glad to be an American
‚Ä¢ Cal State San Marcos: America is the only country that matters.

‚Ä¢ Notre Dame: Grateful? Yes. I don‚Äôt think pride is the correct emotion.

Much different than ‚Äúrepublicans love America[comment]They should leave then.
[comment]Biased domain haha. That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. Breitbart is trash. This is an absurd article that probably wasn't even based off a real poll.
[comment]Well looking at our current president not surprised.  The negative stereotype on Americans is being dumb and lazy.  Well at least the former can be declared true.

[comment]I'm the son of immigrant parents and I love being american. I have visited both of my parents home countries (I'm asian) and would not trade places to live in either one. Even some of our crappiest universities are top 100 in the world (my school). That's a thing people never talk about. How unusual is it that the US has so many nationally renowned universities when most countries have only one or two. We lead in scientific discoveries and innovation.  Any industry you wish to work in it's hard to argue that the US is not a prime place to find a job for that industry. Some of the crappiest houses I've seen in the US is league's better than the crumbling unsafe houses I've seen visiting other countries. My dad worked his ass off and succeeded in the land of opportunity and is able to support all his relatives and my mothers back in their home countries. You are rewarded in the US for the amount of hard work you put in and I cannot say the same for other countries.
[comment]I'm shocked 25% of Republicans are not proud to be Americans
[comment]Why i'm not proud to be American: Lives in Australia
[comment]They were proud almost 3yrs and then they learned how democracy really worked.
[comment]They're traitors to their country
[comment]I have been to many countries in the last 20 years.

I always talk withfolks in bars and restaurants and in conferences and I can tell you that the opinions of foreigners have dramatically changed in the last few years.

The overwhelming majority of people I have talked to said two things about electing trump:

1. Have you all lost your minds? This was almost *every person I spoke with* when they realized I was American.

2. He isgoing to try to become a dictator and we *know* dictators. This was said in many different waysbutitall boiled down to the same set of words.

So no
We have a man in the white house who thinks he should be king. We have the world telling us we are out of our minds. 

How can anyone be "proud" of that???
[comment]Only 75%? Darn it‚Äôs lower than I thought. I need to speak to the soldiers.

[title]Two-thirds of Americans say voting by mail would increase voter fraud[selftext]https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/polling/poll-finds-23-american-voters-say-voting-mail-would-increase-voter-fraud[comment]What does the data say about voter fraud by mail?  Who gives fuck about a poll?
[comment]Just because a bunch of ignorant people think something doesn't make it the truth. Americans are really easy to persuade. The military votes by mail every year. Can our party get back to real issues now?
[comment]Just Two Thirds? LoL
[comment]Just what the democrats had in mind.
[comment]Where‚Äôs the proof there would be fraud?
[comment]People have been gathering and lining up at grocery stores for months so just put the voting booths there since Democrats don‚Äôt complain about those locations
[comment]What do actual professionals think?
[comment]But that is how the Democrats will "get rid of Trump[comment]If its vote by mail it will be a fraud fest.
[comment]This post is a joke.
[comment]I just don't understand this. Who is it that people don't trust? Is it the mailman[comment]Polls by whom?
[comment]Brit here. We have it[comment]The real issue is can a state do it securely and fairly. Ohio barely did it because they have 2 decades of vote by mail experienceNew York has 1% that vote absentee and had no infrastructure set up[comment]1200 was the same size for this.... US population:~328.2 million....1200/328[comment]Having traveled extensively for work[comment]And the other third knows it but just will not say it!
[comment]Public opinion polls are meaningless
[comment]not sure how it isn't 100%. 

Would phone in purchases of booze increase underage alcohol consumption?
[comment]Seriously?
[comment]I strongly believe that voting by mail would help prevent voter fraud. In fact I don‚Äôt think that there is any significant amount of voter fraud in this country. Hell you can barely get people to vote in the first place. Remember that committee that Kris Kobach ran<|startoftext|>
[title]Twitter And Social Media Are A Cancer On Our Civic Life
[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/30/twitter-and-social-media-are-a-cancer-on-our-civic-life-they-dont-deserve-protection/[comment]They are a cancer because under the excuse of being private they have attempted to portray their "portal" virtue allowing people to express themselves while at the same time censoring conservatives and manipulating search results to promote the left agenda.   When you have mega corporations like these trying to politically influence elections its time to regulate them or terminate them.
[comment]The beauty of living in a free society is that you could simply choose to not use Twitter if you don't like it so much. It would be frustrating if Twitter were the only option for social media... Maybe someone should[comment]Just delete your Twitter account.
[comment]100% agreed! 

That would put an end to all these disinformation campaigns[comment]Then don't use it[comment]The problem with Twitter and Social Media in general is that it gives everyone an equal platform to voice their opinions. The problem is not all opinions are equal and don‚Äôt deserve any platform with which to be heard.
[comment]To all those who are saying ‚ÄúdOnT uSe iT‚Äù. I believe this guy is trying to say[comment]Yeah but so are republicans so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[comment]Yeah but that doesn‚Äôt mean we have the right to shut them down. Let people do what they want. Just hold yourself accountable to the values you place on others.
[comment]They are only as cancerous as the people who use them.
[comment]Social media is really a cancer that eats away your mental healthy slowly[comment]Delete
[comment]Yeah[comment]I agree but also ironic when the republican president puts out so many tweets per day
[comment]Don‚Äôt use it then.
[comment]As much I can agree they are toxic at many times[comment]Twitter should be shut down[comment]He said as he posted on a social media site.
[comment]Hey Pelosi[comment]Great article!
[comment]Media is an underlying cause of our divisiveness and hate.  Being in everyone‚Äôs homes on a nightly basis perpetuating hate[comment]Yeah no kidding. Wish we had arrived at that conclusion before it became an official policy tool of the state. It‚Äôs too easy for liberals to be validated by people with no stake in this country as they shout into the void.

[title]BERNIE CAMP EXPOSED: Field Organizer Says ‚ÄòF***ing Cities Will Burn‚Äô if Trump Wins[selftext]https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/f7z7hd/bernie_camp_exposed_field_organizer_says_fing/[comment]Bernie Bros are a bunch of basement dwellers who think Dungeons and Dragons is life. Like to see them try anything on someone who actually fights back.
[comment]Kind of a biased source[comment]Not surprised. I believe there are videos calling for a riot if Bernie loses. Either way if Bernie win[comment]Bring it on slave party democrats!!!..Your civil war will end like the last with the racist Jim Crow party beat down by the Republicans
[comment]Love your enemy but keep your gun oiled.
[comment]Bernie Bros are ignorants without education. They sucks.
[comment]Bernie will never get the nominaton[comment]You forget libtards... Republicans support the second amendment.... You try to put us in the camps... We will shoot you.
[comment]Don't take it lightly. Ask Steve Scalise if he does. Bernie attracts radicals and they have nothing to lose.
[comment]What? This is fake news 100%
[comment]I worry that Bernie won't know the first thing about executive power and will let the lunatics into his administration. He's not going to know how to pick a cabinet or surround himself with wise counsel. His court will be full of inexperienced fire-brand extemists who have no idea how to wield power. I predict that his administration will resort to iron-fisted and poorly executed methods to exercise his agenda. Do we have any evidence that Bernie knows the first thing about executive power?
[comment]If you put the spotlight on crazy all you see is crazy.
[comment]Mark my words[comment]What kind of Facebook post looking click bait is this crap? Just because someone supports Bernie doesn‚Äôt mean they are trying to burn cities. Just means they don‚Äôt understand economics or they want ‚Äúfree‚Äù stuff.
[comment]Why do Bernie supporters want to kill almost the whole country?
[comment]This is Russian Troll Trap garbage. Pumped out to cause division here in the USA.  Its wel documented that chaos and a weakened US government is Putins goal. Unfortunately[comment]Thought that was Roosh V for a second.

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/p7ynyacg3xh41.jpg[comment]Excellent article !!!  Hopefully the younger generations read this and understand what is at stake come November elections.
[comment]Amazing!!!
[comment]Another reason is high taxation on businesses causes failing businesses[comment]I get what this is saying[comment]If I had a dollar for every time socialism worked I would have zero dollars...coincidentally if it did work I would still have zero dollars.
[comment]Ifunny watermark
[comment]I‚Äôve got to show this to a few people.
[comment]The next stages is where the administration steps in and says that they expect passing grades.  So the teacher grades on the curve and everyone gets a B no matter what.  It's a change from economics knowledge backed grades to fiat grades.  For a while[comment]I'm inclined not to believe this. The administration would have stepped in to make sure the students got the grade they earned fair and square.
[comment]I‚Äôm glad actually learning is going on at this college

[comment]I always see these socialist students say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best thing ever because it‚Äôll make everything equal‚Äù but as soon as you ask if someone who didn‚Äôt study should get your grades
For some reason this applies to money but in life[comment]Does anyone have any Insightful responses to why it‚Äôs so popular in the media? Like I read this article and it makes perfect sense but you have die hard Bernie fans who swear it will work.  Like thousands and thousands of them. 
Is there something we‚Äôre missing? How is one portion of the population so naive to its ravages? I just can‚Äôt wrap my mind around it
[comment]Democrat[comment]This needs to be read by everyone on earth
[comment]Beautiful
[comment]But the person at the top of the capitolist tree just makes the rest of the students do the work for an F while taking A* without having touched a book
[comment]In order for socialism to succeed[comment]The problem is every generation or so sees this shiny prize at the edge of the cliff and assumes that the reason socialism fails is that those stupid old people were just not advanced or smart enough to implement it properly. It is like the gun control experts assume that to end all violence and crime is to eliminate all guns. The real variable that disrupts the equation is human nature and free will. And try as they might to beat and slaughter it out of society the Nazis[comment]Socialism and communism are not the same and its a false equivocation to discuss as such. It would be like saying capitalism/fascism. No one is suggesting the economic equivalent of this situation.

Ignorance is rampant

[selftext]https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2020/03/03/obama-party-decends-socialism/[comment]Supporting Joe Biden?  What is this guy even on about?
[comment]enjoying the destruction[comment]He said Bernie isn't fit for President.
[comment]Curious what his annual income is post Presidency and what steps he‚Äôs taken to secure it
[comment]Well he knows his endorsement could cause more devision[comment]I don't see what the big deal is here. Obama has too much influence here[comment]In his water front estate screaming about climate change
[comment]I saw someone call Obama a republican the other day on r/politics
[comment]An Obama endorsement would only hurt Democrats.

He could shoot his load early and endorse Joe. Obama alienates the Bernie people and hurts the Dems. He alienated the Bernie supporters and a good chunk vote for Trump. If Joe loses
If Obama endorses Bernie
Obama‚Äôs best move is to wait to for Joe to pick a VP [comment]Where are republicans while their party descends into facism?
[comment]Fascinating because I recall he was accused of socialism himself.
[comment]His absence is pretty remarkable right? Would've thought he was going to give Joe a pat on the butt at some point before super Tuesday but nope. Water[comment]Enjoying his millions in peace
[comment]Agreeing with them full stop.   Obama does not disagree with communism.  He helped it around the world and praised the "positive" of communism and even told venezuelans there really is no difference between silly capitalist/communist labels.  Just vote for what {feels good} is right.
[comment]Obama is part of the movement toward Socialism and he's working in the background.
[comment]Obama doesn't give a shit about any of that. He just wanted to the pay day of being the president and he's cashed in on that like no other. The party falling to shit means nothing because Trump already destroyed any political legacy he was ever going to have and since it doesn't benefit him he just doesn't care. He'd rather be making absurd money helping Netflix come up with some half baked TV show.
[comment]Obama will walk up wearing a MAGA hat and say that he purposely sabotaged the Democratic party‚Ñ¢ to pave the way for Trump[comment]he's enjoying the view...his dream come true
[comment]He‚Äôs the captain that got the ship there. He‚Äôs just sitting back until Joe wins.
[comment]really who cares  i don't
[comment]He‚Äôs likely trying to get rid of Sanders. I thinks that ball is on motion now.
[comment]Popping champion and celebrating is my guess
[comment]Tbf i would not want to have to deal with politics after being president for 8 years. Then again I‚Äôm very lazy.
[comment]Who do you think made the calls to Bob O'Rourke[comment]He's laughing his ass off because during his entire presidency you guys called him a socialist.
[comment]Honestly I don't mind Obama staying out of it.

Former presidents should wait until a nominees pick and then get behind them
[comment]The dems have been supporting the ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù as their platform
Hence
But this started when dems began accepting lobby money during the Clinton era. They kept losing elections because money bought republicans over and over again. 3 decades later
Quite unfortunate

[comment]Attempted robbery is a crime. Attempted murder is a crime. Intent proves the crime. You can still be prosecuted and found guilty. These are facts regardless of whether or not you believe in them or feel that they're fair.

[comment]Trump needs to copy warren anti-tech  monopoly things now!!!
[comment]W
[comment]Ben Shapiro talked about this on his show yesterday and he said to all of the people attacking Facebook to be careful because Elizabeth Warren controlling Facebook is infinitely worse than the petty and minor grievances people have against the company.
[comment]The rest of society doing well apparently sucks to Mark.
[comment]I actually don‚Äôt completely disagree with Zuckerberg or Warren on this particular subject. 

It‚Äôs very much a two way street. Facebook has clearly
The issue is our government should really not be getting that deeply involved with a normal business. It could just as easily be a cover for both republicans and democrats to try and take a grip on a vein of social power like Facebook
Ideally it should be the populace who see corruption in a business and stop investing into their product. Move to a different company; however in the case of big tech you have a lot of people too addicted to change. 

Idk honestly all around it‚Äôs a really sticky situation and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it has an outcome that is fair.
[comment]I agree. As I don't think he's a fan of Trump what would he do if she won the nomination?
[comment]He ain‚Äôt lying
[comment]He's right y'know.
[comment]Liberals.

Socialism is all the rage until it it turns its greedy eye your way[comment]**MANUFACTURED CONSENT**

"Wallstreet fears an Elizabeth Warren presidency" - The Hill

"Warren has put the fear of god into Wallstreet" - Axios

"Elizabeth Warren 2020 has Wallstreet very angry" - Vox 

"Wallstreet is scared of Elizabeth Warren" - CNBC 

Elizabeth "Capitalist To My Bones" Warren poses no threat to this immoral/rigged system. It's all fake. A fluke to prevent an actual reformist from being elected. The purpose of this manufactured bullshit is to sway politically illiterate "progressive" voters towards supporting Warren over the only actual candidate the wealthy fear. I don't even have to say his name. You already know. 

The 1% wouldn't tell voters who to vote for if they want to stick it to the 1%. That's why Warren gets all the attention from the mainstream propaganda machine while Voldemort's name is rarely mentioned unless it's negative news. üåπ

[title]How Did the Bidens' Corruption Become Trump's Scandal?
[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2019/12/18/__trashed-888/[comment]The left are total masters of projection
[comment]To cover their asses
[comment]Funny[comment]It's bad timing. Calling the investigation on Biden in the midst of a campaign? I hate creepy Joe but you gotta admit[comment]Because Orange Man Bad
[comment]Biden is involved in shady business[comment]Leftism is a mental illness
That's how it got this far
[comment]Biden was confusing official business that was in the interest of the United States (in conjunction with a group of other nations). His actions were not suspect and have nothing to do with Trumps actions. 

Trump asked a foreign nation to take action that was in his personal interest and used the power of his office to try and make this happen. 

Linking the two is a mental illness
[comment]Because three years of hyperbolic scandals cant be wrong. This is the narrative to reinforce delusional projections of Orange man bad.

He has governed way more conservative than expected setting historical figures of social progression but that doesent matter.

The media said he was bad day one so they cant lost their credibility and they have to reinforce the delusional farce that there is a crisis.

This is not a scandal. It is a new precedent of political attacks that will forever change how both parties conduct themselves. 

The Democrats overplayed their hand on this one and it will haunt them for the next decade.

Elon Musk is right. Work is a noble undertaking
Shutting down the economy to try and avoid one kind of death does not end death. All you have done is trade death by the virus for death by starvation. 

Shutting down the economy was designed to not overwhelm the health services.  So mission accomplished.  It was not intended to avoid death. Keeping the economy closed is not going to provide any more benefits than it already has. But it will introduce a lot more negatives than the virus could ever have done.  

So let just remember this about communists that are seeking to use this attack by the Chinese Communist Party to accelerate their revolution and maximize economic damage to the United States: 

"Communists never fix the problem they simply fix the blame and manufacture the problem. Because problems for communists are a fundraising opportunity and a political stage."

[title]Democrats view on trump
[selftext]Me and my dad were talking the other day about how trump has handled the situation pretty well. As well as anyone could have with the info given anyway. And we were talking about how the democrats just despise him. He can't do right in their eyes and it really shows what kind of people they are. Not all democrats but most.

They would much rather millions more Americans die to coronavirus so they could blame it on him than to admit that he isn't that bad. Real patriotic right. What did Obama do when anything like this happened? With swine flu. Did nothing yet they praised him. I've even heard people saying Obama would of handled this way better.

I really didn't like trump when he got elected but I've changed my views after seeing how he has done. Since when is there anything wrong with putting America first and standing up to other countries and stop paying them all this money.

Any instances you guys have of stuff like this?[comment]Nice to hear a young independent thinker that came to a conclusion despite the constant negative buzz around trump.

If you would like to see the other view and lose all your fake internet points - go to r/politics and make this post.
[comment]I'm younger myself and came around to him just recently. In a previous life I'd even called myself a Democrat!

I really don't know what the deal is. He's even giving out money
Obama could have farted in Michelle's mouth bare assed on live TV and they'd be saying how much it helped people with COVID. Same could be said for Hillary[comment]So downplaying the virus and repeatedly saying it was just the flu until late Feb is responding well?
America will have more deaths than any other country and you still think trump is leading well?

[comment]Honest to goodness[comment]Ive recently had a change of mind after starting to follow this coronavirus closely 3 months ago. This is all being overblown. Antibody tests already showing that fatality rate is much much lower. We are being fucked economically right now from various angles. We need to reopen because just like in China and other places in Europe they are getting their second waves. We are going to have to ensure these lockdown restrictions again? It is going to be a damn cycle of this BS. This thing isnt going to disappear overnight. 

Average age of death from Wuhan and Italy last time I heard was 80-81 years old. Also the vast majority had some preexisting conditions.

Oh nevermind[comment]Just so I‚Äôm clear... there‚Äôs never been poor people before 1848?

Interesting hypothesis.
[comment]It really depends. Go to Norway[comment]This entire demonization of the word socialism is stupid. An entirely socialistic system is stupid just like an entirely capitalistic system would be stupid. There are ideas on both sides of the spectrum that are good and bad. The way the united states pays for police currently is socialistic but I think it works pretty well. I wouldn't want a private police force. Giving agriculture huge bail outs is technically socialism but I don't think that was the best idea either. Yet on the other hand just letting a bunch of companies that produce food fail ( which is what the capitalistic answer would have been) probably isn't the best idea either. Labeling acts socialism is just another identity politics game to divide people which works because it takes away the need to talk about what is actually going on.

Yes
We should have also used our near 2 month head start to getting testing ready: free
South Korea was able to do this. They have had a good handle on this thing from day 1. Copious testing allowed them to catch new cases quickly and quarantine just those infected. So the number of new cases peaked quickly

It is an insurgency.  And that is what happens when one political party use the intelligence agencies and the federal bureau of investigations in a coup d'√©tat to overthrow the president of the United States just because their Wall Street backers are pissed that their $500 billion dollars a year Chinese Communist Party grift has been ended. 

Hey
Fix your media messaging or lose everything you have.

Today should have been about America going back into space.  Wall Street made it about getting rid of the President of the United States because he has ended the game of selling out the United States citizens to the Chinese Communist Party.  A $500 Billion dollar a year grift that was bankrupting the nation and killing our citizens.  

Follow the money.  The groups that organized the nationwide terrorist insurgency are funded.  Their comms are trackable.

[selftext]https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-ruth-bader-ginsburg-halts-democrats-attempts-to-get-trump-financial-records[comment]LOLGF
[comment]I'm just gonna sit back and wait for the videos of people in vagina hats burning their Notorious R.B.G gear lol
[comment]well[comment]For someone who‚Äôs innocent
If you have a valid reason to refute me please have at it. I honestly would like to hear everyone‚Äôs side.
[comment]The people who love Ginsburg have never read a single one of her opinions; nor have the people that hate her for that matter. She‚Äôs a reasonable woman and has made decisions favoring things that people who love her would hate
[comment]Liberals are preparing to unplug her...
[comment]Misleading headline. She upheld a stay so the court could have a week to decide their next steps. This is purely procedural.

[selftext]https://i.imgflip.com/3kz55d.jpg[comment]Wut
[comment]This is scare tactic propaganda trying to brain wash sheeple. Tacky
[comment]Makes people think that all non conservatives are baby killers
[comment]This is true
[comment]I‚Äôm pro guns pro choice pro weed and pro trump. Don‚Äôt lump all Republicans into the pro life category
[comment]Either way if you don‚Äôt wrap up or take other precautionsTalkin to you bernie[comment]Boomerest thing I've seen today
[comment]Yeah im definitely conservative but thats a pretty boomer thing to post[comment]Personally i am against abortion since i have my shit together. But not in all cases. If i had a 15 16 year old daughter i'd be for it. Since she whould still need to focus on school and getting her life on track.

I am however ALWAYS against abortion to just be used as anti conception replacement for the pill or condoms.

And the person wanting one. Should always pay out of pocket. Its a privelidge not a right.
[comment]Whoa! No words...
[comment]Pro-life or choice that baby‚Äôs gonna need a rhinoplasty stat.
[comment]It's fun how they demand everyone has the right to live
...right until you turn 18 without having any marketable skills and you can go right ahead and starve[comment]My mom is pro choice conservative so I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd hope she‚Äôs pro-life
[comment]"I do not believe that just because you're opposed to abortion that that makes you pro-life. In fact
Pro life people have no consideration for the fact that the baby they'll force to be born[comment]‚ÄúI hope I wasn‚Äôt the result of an attack by a violent or incestuous rapist...‚Äù

Fixed it for you
[comment]Oh man these comments are a treat
[comment]This shit is what makes conservatives look bad. Facebook tier memes don't belong. This is the type of shit you see old people sharing because they think they're "hip with the kids".
[comment]If a fetus could actually have that thought
Quit trying to use emotionally charged images in lieu of cogent arguments.
[comment]I'm pro-choice
[comment]I think abortion is good for _some_ cases[comment]My opinion is that abortions are like guns: If they're illegal then people will just get them illegally.
[comment]Surely you see that what you are talking about is COMPLETELY different1. Raising an animal is worlds apart from bringing a human to this Earth. It is 5-10 years commitment of your time for an animal2. When a woman has a child
FYI I am a man; one who believes that women should be able to choose whether they let something grow in their bodies.

[comment]If there wasn‚Äôt such a political spin on everything the news does they would be more trusted and then more utilized.  Advertisers would know their ads are watched because the news source is trusted and watched.

[comment]Hey[comment]I am determined to put one foot in front of the other and get through this. My level of compassion...I simply can't describe it. Believe me. I can't.
[comment]Right so many opinions marked as fact
[comment]We need mainstream journalists right now about as much as we need nude pics of Hillary
[comment]‚ÄúJournalists‚Äù

more like biased political hacks
[comment]Goodbye. All they do is report fear.
[comment]So that‚Äôs why cnn isn‚Äôt covering the sexual assault allegations against Biden...
[comment]We don't need 75% of the people calling themselves "journalists". And if I never again have to see the ramblings and rants of pop culture critics and intersectional social justice types I'll be a happy camper.
[comment]This is why they should've learned to code.
[comment]But how will I get my Brian Stelter fix?
[comment]Of course my friend[comment]"Journalists"
[comment]In actually communist countries[comment]Recently

[comment]CNN confusing themselves with Fox?
[comment]Some good news
[comment]Laid off or arrested?  The crime:  pretending to be journalists.
[comment]Maybe we need more teachers since the post itself has two errors. Hmm

[comment]Victory
[comment]Karma's a bitch isn't it Pelosi. You guys had no chance of removing him from office as President.
[comment]So who's getting charged with treason
[comment]The Dems need to investigate whoever keeps selling them these tin bullets and saying they‚Äôre silver
[comment]I'm glad to see Trump is still our President. The only question is when does round three start?
[comment]You know they‚Äôre going to come up with some made up shit soon to go after him
[comment]would u look at that what we all knew was going to happen happened
[comment]Meanwhile at the Democrat meeting 

_Impeachment plan is kil. Come up with something[comment]Yessssss i knew suck on that dems!
[comment]She knew this would happen. She knew it would be an aimless waste of taxpayer dollars. I'd say she won out tbh. Her goal was to get fuel for a smear campaign in 2020
Can you hear it yet? "Donald Trump is the ONLY PRESIDENT TO BE IMPEACHED THIS CENTURY. Even a member of his own party KNEW that he ABUSED HIS POWER. Dump Trump. Vote Democrat."

They can say that now. I watched 20 minutes of msnbc after the votes and all they talked about was how Romney voted guilty and how heroic it was. I nearly puked.
[comment]*nO oNe iS aBoVe tHe lAw!*
[comment]So[comment]Rough week for the dems. Haha
[comment]This wasnt suprising
[comment]Yet the headlines are
 Amazing how off the rails the Republican Party was with that Demopublican as our nominee. Who knew Donald Trump would single handedly save the Republican Party?
[comment]I know it won‚Äôt happen. But if the republicans win back the house and Biden wins in 2020. What the republicans need to do is at 12:01 on January 20th is introduce articles of impeachment.
[comment]They knew all along the president wouldn‚Äôt get removed. They wanted the spectacle.

Trump did nothing wrong[comment]&gt;I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses  
&gt;  
&gt;I do not believe that additional witnesses are needed.  I have said consistently for the past four months&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It is clear from the July 25&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**the Senate should be ashamed by the rank partisanship that has been on display**. ‚Ä¶**The President‚Äôs behavior was shameful and wrong.  His personal interests do not take precedence over those of this great nation**.  The president has the responsibility to uphold the integrity and honor of the office.  Not just for himself but for all future presidents.  **Degrading the office&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a ‚Äúhigh crime and misdemeanor.‚Äù Yes&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I believe that delaying the aid was **inappropriate and wrong** and shouldn‚Äôt have hap

So let it be said[comment]Glad the truth prevailed over a hoax/made up accusations
[comment]It upsets me that some people are dumb enough to believe that the impeachment trial wasn't politically motivated<|startoftext|>

[comment]Under Trump[comment]God bless.
[comment]It is what happens when the blame America first crowd is forced out. Electing any of the mental and moral midgets campaigning for the Democrat/Marxist nomination will just return our domestic enemies to power.
[comment]The head line is very true

And it's all because of Donald Trump who is fighting back

Obama did nothing to help

Do nothing Democrats
[comment]This is all mostly easily disprovable bullshit.

&gt;Trump has even built his wall 

No he hasn't. There literally isn't a wall. 

&gt;We've seen a dramatic bump in economic growth

No
&gt;China came back to the table and capitulated. It was a massive victory for the U.S. economy
Pretty weird victory for farmers if you have to bail them out at taxpayers expense: [U.S. to pay farmers up to $16 billion for trade war losses](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/us-to-pay-farmers-up-to-16-billion-for-trade-war-losses-south-to-benefit-idUSKCN1UK2M7)

Not to mention the hyperbolic tone. He uses 'greatest' and 'perfect' six times. Come on. Conservative thought can be better than this.
[comment]No they're just laughing at us.
[comment]Except to Saudi princes and Vladimir Putin
[comment]Yeah they‚Äôre right we aren‚Äôt their doormat anymore. We are television stuck on one channel that only plays Standup üòÇ
[comment]So many triggered comments from the woke mob.

[comment]Will these democrats in the comments just fuck off

[comment]A Democrat lying[comment]RedRum
[comment]According to the democratic voting roles[comment]That's odd simply because all those body bags lined up and all those people who are no longer on this earth...but okay then[comment]I‚Äôm so sick of this ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù being politicized because it shows the ignorance of one side vs the other.

I‚Äôm sick of hearing from folks that received government assistance saying we shouldn‚Äôt return to work and normalcy.

Of course not
I‚Äôm dipping in to my savings as needed but I get no assistance from the government.  I sure as hell paid for that assistance... but I‚Äôm tired of these idiots complaining that they don‚Äôt want to go back to work because it‚Äôs more profitable for them not to.

These are the same morons that have 8 kids and receive substantial government assistance.  So tired of this shit.
[comment]Incorrect[comment]Got $50 that says you'll find the deceased names on a Democratic voter ballot [comment]But you kinda did. Not even trying to hide their lies anymore[comment]Cough*bullshit*coughcough
[comment]The quote in the title is severely cut off. Regardless of my own stance on this issue
‚ÄúAnd we didn‚Äôt lose anyone for want of medical care[comment]It‚Äôs sad that literally no one wanted to politicize any of this until the dems decided every single death in covid is somehow trumps fault. The dems have actually done the worst of everyone in this and they are the ones trying to politicize it. I‚Äôm sorry[comment]It was an intentional move to increase the total number of fatalities and make the Federal Government increase the funds for NY. The guy is a Criminal and in NY we all know that.
[comment]The Butcher of Brooklyn tries to deflect blame.
[comment]Hes mental
[comment]Sad that he sent covid-19 positive patients back to nursing homes and not to a proper quarantine.  

I know hindsight is always 2020[comment]I hate fake news more than the next guy. But he constantly complained about the amount of people New York lost. Begging for ventilators prior to the peak curve. We need to stop politicizing the situation. The man NEVER said this.
[comment]We were called inconsiderate and muzzled 3 months ago when we said we should just super safe guard people at risk (based on Italy's data).... Looks like Andrew Cuomo and the rest of society should have listened.
[comment]Up hill battle to get anyone to investigate fairly across all party lines.  We‚Äôve crossed over into the twilight zone of half-truths[comment]As Cuomo said ‚ÄúHey people die!‚Äù
[comment]I have friends in nursing homes in NYC and one of them so far died from Covid cause of this order.
[comment]You know how there's a /r/shitstatistssay and a /r/shitpoliticssays?

May I introduce you to /r/ShitCuomosSay. Your one stop shop for everything Chris and Andrew Cuomo.
[comment]It‚Äôs the memory hole. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been at war with Eurasia‚Äù.
[comment]I wish people would stop being so ignorant. Blame CHINA. CHINA is where the virus was weaponized. The CHINESE allowed thousands of infected people to travel the WORLD. This was AFTER they knew of human to human transmission. Blame the Chinese!!!

[comment]How many other states shoved recovering covid 19 patients into nursing homes and rehab centers?  

Is it standard hospital / insurance practice for recovering patients?  Certainly makes sense for a hip injury
Seems the focus was on discharging in order to clear bed space for new patients.  Yet the Javits center build out was for naught.

My verdict[comment]I am very glad to see the most upvoted comments here are being critical of the source. Don‚Äôt follow the media blindly; this article has a lack of real evidence- which is ironic considering their criticism of others lack of evidence- on a news source that is deemed generally unreliable.

Trump received just criticism for the more extreme elements in his base of support; but Sanders and the "Bernie Bros" take it to a whole new level.

Sanders has no shot of winning by virtue of the fact his brand is going to be incredibly toxic as more of this behavior comes to light.

The final resolution of the case
When Amato made his claims
Did Trump family members steal from a children‚Äôs cancer charity?

The allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children‚Äôs cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state.

Amato‚Äôs viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general
Investigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds
The Associated Press
‚ÄúA charity operated by one of Donald Trump‚Äôs sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity‚Äôs board
Among other claims
‚Äî The Eric Trump Foundation failed to report multiple conflicts of interest by supposedly independent board members who work for The Trump Organization or Eric Trump‚Äôs winery
‚Äî Based on its revenue and giving
‚Äî Though public charity boards are supposed to represent the public
The 2017 Forbes¬†article
It should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of ‚Äústealing

[comment]Is there any rule how long she can hold onto this before sending to senate? Can she wait until the Senate flips to Democrats (not that that's forseeable)?
Cruz said these Democrat senators running for prez will be swamped in the Senate with this for 6 weeks and wont be able to campaign. Curious if she is doing it to help them out.
[comment]Why did the Democrats lie for 3 years about Russian collusion and obstruction of justice and not impeach the president? Do they take their voters as suckers? Yes
[comment]Obviously the point is to have Trump in the history books as officially impeached and never cleared by the Senate. He clearly isn't going to be removed from office by this. 

One of the few things people 100 years from now will know about Trump is that he was impeached.

Disagreed all you want[comment]This is the democrats game plan as far as I can tell[comment]I'll believe all this bluster when I see it. McConnell has disappointed before.
[comment]Good[comment]The way I understand it[comment]They‚Äôre hoping they‚Äôll take the senate in 2020 then remove him when he gets re-elected? Not really sure what crazy Nancy is up to here[comment]Just look at the Vegas odds. It was -500 that he would get impeached (bet 500 you receive 100) and the odds that‚Äôs he‚Äôs removed from office are -5000. It‚Äôs just comically polar and has nothing to do with bipartisan action.

[comment]Is the trillion dollar national debt and weak growth not baked in to this equation?
[comment]Too bad you need 3 jobs to pay your bills. But the economy is doing tremendously big.
[comment]Not gonna lie. It's great for some. 

the people it's great for had it good anyway[comment]- ***Here's the reality. By most traditional measures[comment]It has been great for me!
[comment]It was also great under Obama. Its almost like we live in boom and bust periods of economic  growth.
[comment]The Democrats don't want to acknowledge this fact.
[comment]Liberals: but it's because Obama it just took 10 years for his plans to start working.

Me: just smiling and pitying how dumb they are.
[comment]The economy started coming back with the destruction of Obamacare[comment]Wait until the Boomers start retiring. Capital markets will contract significantly and interests rates will go way up. Enjoy this age of free money while it lasts.

Also the stock market is massively inflated due to an overflow of Boomer investments chasing any opportunity they can find. All those stocks will come down considerably and in that process tons of wealth will be lost.

Finally
On the other hand[comment]I don‚Äôt think anyone has mentioned the fact that we‚Äôre effectively seeing QE4 right now. Is the stock market pumping? Yes. Is that an effect of low unemployment or getting out of ‚Äúbad trade deals‚Äù probably not.

We are doing the same thing we did in 2008 to get out of a depression but now we already have insanely low interest rates and low unemployment. 

Takeaway: if the economy really is so great we probably shouldn‚Äôt be massively increasing our money supply. Asset prices like stocks going up (in isolation) doesn‚Äôt equal a strong economy and can result in bubbles

[comment]For who though?
[comment]I'm with you. But there's been no real change in income inequality or the rising cost of healthcare. The thing is that his administration hasn't revealed any ideas to change things.

[comment]The economy doing good isnt an indicator of the average person doing good. All this means is coporate interests are getting paid.

[comment]The middle  class. They say they will tax the upper class but they wont.
[comment]Taxes. Some of us pay close to 40 to 45% in taxes.  To those who are okay with the tax increase then they should pay for it and not force the rest of us into the disaster that is the government bureaucracy. This is being done at the barrel of a gun. They‚Äôre okay with putting some of us into the 70% tax range
The poor already get Medicaid and welfare this isn‚Äôt about redistribution of wealth[comment]We can just print it... and crush our own economy
[comment]This conversation just makes my ears steam.  In the broadest sense of the word "money
This is Democrats preying on the ignorant.  People think that just because someone like Sanders or Warren says they'll tax the rich to get 32 trillion dollars that there must actually be 32 trillion dollars out there that is collectible.  It never occurs to them that there isn't
So
And that right there is the problem with the Democratic Party.  They aren't actually interested in fixing anything.  They are only interested in power.  It doesn't matter what gets broken.  It doesn't even matter if there's a country left to govern.  As long as they have whatever power there is left to have
They truly are beyond help.

If they don't impeach the President
The Dems will be in trouble with their base. Democratic voters think they have the President red handed. And the Dems don't impeach? Forget it. Many will be disillusioned and stay home in 2020. Rabid voters in NYC or LA will vote but the average Democratic voter in battleground states might stay home.

[comment]I don't say this to be mean. Im stating a fact.  There's something wrong with Joe. Not saying he's got dementia[comment]Honestly people were afraid trump would press the button to start nuclear war[comment]REPORTER: I wanted to ask you specifically about one industry in particular
TRUMP: "Well
‚ÄúAnd many people

‚ÄúSo we‚Äôll be looking at that. And we don‚Äôt want cases like that happening. This was ‚Äî but this ‚Äî this is the kind of thing can happen. This is very complex.

‚ÄúThis is a very brilliant enemy. You know
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fighting ‚Äî not only is it hidden
‚ÄúBut[comment]Uh[comment]This is now elder abuse.
[comment]Surprisingly still more coherent than Trump off the prompter. The bar is truly[comment]I‚Äôm just sad that the best we can do is two incoherent ramblers that are nearly as old as the State of Alaska.

[title]'I think a lot of people cheat': Trump dismisses expanded mail-in voting during coronavirus outbreak
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-think-a-lot-of-people-cheat-trump-dismisses-expanded-mail-in-voting-during-coronavirus-outbreak[comment]100000000% TRUE AND RIGHT 

If you disagree you are probably a Democrat who relies on ballot harvesting and other election meddling methods.

Voter ID and go to a designated voting center. Don't like it? Then GTFO!!!
[comment]We have much higher instances if election fraud than voter fraud.
[comment]Can't we already vote by absentee ballot?
[comment]This should be a State issue[comment]Seems like the party continues this propaganda of supposed ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù. The ideology that everyone is a cheater or cheats the system[comment]All voters should prove citizenship[comment]I don‚Äôt see any issue with mail-in voting with required social security number verification.  Obviously we have to make sure dead people aren‚Äôt voting but that should be easy enough.
[comment]Projection-based-decisions will get us nowhere.

Let's see some data and create a modern system of voting that's accessible and secure. Christ.
[comment]Two words: bloc chain...
[comment]"I think a lot of people cheat" seems to normally be something cheaters say. What does he mean here?  I'm confused
[comment]Just like he said on Fox News[comment]It's hard to parse out the exaggeration and negativity anymore but I just want to point out a few things that are implied here that nobody has mentioned yet.
1. He is undermining the security of the Postal Service which is a federal agency under the Executive branch. Undermining the Intelligence Departments2. He seems to be proposing we all go out and crown public buildings for hours on end to vote. This again is against the recommendations of the WHO3.  Isn't it just really embarrassing to read anything he says when it is typed out verbatim? Like[comment]The States will figure this out for themselves. This isn't a federal issue.

Beyond that
The primaries matter and they're utterly fucked up in process. The general election is far less important.

And yes<|startoftext|>

[comment]r/Politics is 85% just a bunch of deranged leftists pumping each other up about how Trump is bad with mostly false statistics and out of context Trump quotes.

(By mostly false I meant statistics that aren‚Äôt necessarily true[comment]My "contributions" are frequently removed as well.
[comment]Use reddit to turn people against trump? They were already against trump before. Reddit just helps show news stories.
[comment]Down with the Chinese Government! Their people deserve better! The world deserves better!
[comment]So you think China asshoe?
[comment]What is Leddit?
[comment]Kind of ironic this site is called REDdit....shouldn‚Äôt it be Bluedit?
[comment]Most redditors are so into government surveillance[comment]This really is right up the political humor alley. Too bad. China's government[comment]Good joke
[comment]Can some explain this while China took over Reddit idea to me?
[comment]Republicans are one if the main reasons why all the manufacturing jobs went to China in the first place.  Maximum profits at ANY cost to society for the stockholders.

How is capitalism working out for you?   Can't get a man into space without the help of Russia and can't get medicine or PPE gear without a shipment from China.
[comment]I think you give them too much credit in this regard. Spend 5 minutes in r/sino and see what those dick cheeses are writing and you can quickly tell they aren‚Äôt clever enough to persuade anyone on here
[comment]It‚Äôs funny how the left loves diversity[comment]We should spam this in r/politcalhumor

Died of cancer 10 years ago and his EX wife collects 100% of his $9000/mo pension for life.   Public service employees retire young and get job with Another authority and eventually collect double pensions.
[comment]Education is a job where you can suck and still got paid- even though the gov can‚Äôt afford it... crazy!
[comment]Wow. A $380K/year pension. Insane.
[comment]Imagine that stupid shit?
[comment]Then these fucks move to other states and start fucking them up too. They have the bankroll after sucking it out of California.
[comment]National guard needs to go in[comment]Damn[comment]Some of these jobs seem reasonably compensated but others are definitely a yikes
[comment]Just have them declare more COVID-19 deaths than actually exist like New York.
[comment]Looks like it's the end of the track for this ol' gravy train.
[comment]Wanna see something else that'll piss you off? Look at how much firefighters make (most with only a high school education). https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=Fire+ The median HOUSEHOLD income in los angeles is $69[comment]
California‚Äôs budget woes are many. I believe Pete Wilson issued IOU warrants in the early 90‚Äôs. CA later issued tax returns in in the form of an IOU in 2009.

Prior to Brown
When Governor Brown was in office
On to the highly paid public employees; those making $250k+. I‚Äôd agree some of the positions mentioned received exceptionally generous salaries. As for the cops and firefighters
Is California‚Äôs pension system ideal
Is it time for a recall like we did with Gray Davis in our last crisis. Check Newsom in his path? This is his springboard for the presidential run in 2024 or later.
[comment]As an LA County RN my goal is to make full time[comment]Hah. The UC nurse was doing it all the way back in 2011 too.

https://www.ocregister.com/2011/09/13/uc-systems-medical-staff-leads-in-200k-earners/
[comment]you make something like $100k after benefits for pickin up homeless people's poop in San Fran. Wave of the future
[comment]Same with Illinois and New York. Democrats try to buy votes at the expense of tax payers. Thats why blue states have the highest taxes.
[comment]some dude in Norco making more money than the President lmao sheesh
[comment]Remember guys that this wouldn't happen under socialism[comment]It looks like many states have issues with unfunded pensions. 

Here is the from a 2019 report by [TexasPolicy](https://www.texaspolicy.com/5-2-trillion-of-government-pension-debt-threatens-to-overwhelm-state-budgets-taxpayers/)

1.	Alaska
2.	California 
3.	Connecticut 
4.	Illinois 
5.	Arkansas 
6.	Hawaii
7.	Ohio
8.	New Jersey 
9.	Nevada
10. New Mexico 

A more comprehensive 2017 report from Pew can be found [here](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/06/the-state-pension-funding-gap-2017).

This report has a per state chart in Appendix B. 

IMO we need serious pension reform nationwide but one of the first steps has to be eliminating abuses of the system like double dipping.

Ideally
There should be parity between how companies provide for employees and how the government provides for them.
[comment]It‚Äôs income redistribution that the government does under the radar
[comment]this is why 14$ for minimum wage is effecting is even if we don‚Äôt live in cali. we pay for the inflation of that liberal hell hole.
[comment]I‚Äôm from NY and other states should not bail us out. We have much more social programs than other states for example we have free college for middle class and below<|startoftext|>

After all if anyone had gone into his cell they would have been caught on his cell camera or the camera in the hallways...

Well the guards would have seen or heard someone going in to kill him... [oh wait.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-jail-officers.html)

Well he was definitely acting like someone who had given up on life and would likely kill himself... [oh wait](https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/15/report-epsteins-last-words-not-suicidal/)

I mean he had to know that he could never get away with what he did. People like him don't get off easy for stuff like this... [Oh wait](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/07/09/epstein-plea-deal-alex-acosta-drew-griffin-pkg-lead-vpx.cnn)


Well. . . What are we[comment]I am not surprised.
[comment]The picture we we're shown wasnt a dead Epstein. He may not be dead at all
[comment]A real life House of Cards episode..
[comment]Duh
[comment]But nobody will let him investigate
[comment]There are way too many questions about Epstien' death.  Who the fuck is in charge of following up on them?
[comment]Ah yes[comment]homicide of natural causes.
[comment]Washington Post: billionaire philanthropist Jeffery Epstein dies in prison
[comment]Reminds me of Hot Fuzz where even the obvious murders were "Accidents"

[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-leaders-signal-they-wont-accept-trump-acquittal-as-legitimate[comment]Oh well[comment]They never accept any of their losses as legitimate. They've been conspiring and lying for 4 years now about Trump. They got their investigation which proved no collusion in any way[comment]Since when is
[comment]Honestly[comment]The biggest sore losers in american history!!!
[comment]Fuck 'em - doesn't matter one iota what they say after he's acquitted as he won't be removed from office and he'll continue to be president. Pelosi and co. will continue to spout their nonsense that he's not truly acquitted because the senate trial didn't get run the way they wanted it to. And anyone with half a brain will dismiss that with a wave and the world will continue to turn.

They chose this gambit[comment]This is what happens when everyone gets a participation trophy.  People just can‚Äôt loose gracefully.  

No witnesses?  No documentation?  Wasn‚Äôt that the House‚Äôs job to present all of that?
[comment]To be fair[comment]They still can't accept the fact half the country didn't want a Clinton; especially Hillary.  It wouldn't matter which one of the 17 were running and won the spot[comment]Who gives a shit what they will accept?  They still haven't accepted the results of the last election.  Fuck these clowns.
[comment]Leave it to a democrat to not understand no means no.
[comment]What are they going to do? Overthrow the senate?
[comment]Of course they won‚Äôt[comment]Of course they won‚Äôt.  This crap will never stop until the Democrats have to face some consequences for their shady mob boss actions.
[comment]Why would they?  Physically grownup school children with no ability to accept that the American people ‚Äúmoved their cheese‚Äù in 2016.
[comment]I don't accept the impeachment articles as legitimate.
[comment]big surprise. Since when do liberals accept or listen to anything they don't like. At least they can't physically assault anyone directly over it.
[comment]Let's all hope all the democrats are to busy playing games or getting stoned in November.
[comment]The senate shall have the sole power.......
[comment]Of course they wont lol. It's their way or the high way. Fuck them. I'm so tired of the u godly amount of bullshit that comes from them
[comment]Democracy to a DemoKKKrat is only considered democracy if they win. 

Just remember[comment]Just remember folks when responding to a liberal
MAGA 2020 and Trump is still YOUR President -  triggers them!!
[comment]I can‚Äôt stand r/politics. Always getting notifications about radical left posts from kids who don‚Äôt know any better. To me the Democrats are insane[comment]Are they serious[comment]As long as Republicans don‚Äôt mimic these same sore loser tactics I can stand 100% firm with our party but sadly history does show times when we often say similar things after a loss.  Granted it‚Äôs nowhere near as prevalent and extreme as the current left.  I get the what goes around comes around mentality but we should def try to do it in a way that doesn‚Äôt make us look like a bunch of hypocritical asses ya know?
