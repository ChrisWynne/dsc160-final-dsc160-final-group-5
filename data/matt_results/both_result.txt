<|startoftext|>[title]Charlotte Alter: If Warren drops out, I’m not so sure Bernie can necessarily count on those voters. Many are educated liberals who like Warren because they’re attracted to her *practicality,* alienated from Bernie’s sometimes-aggressive base, and want Trump gone more than they want revolution.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/CharlotteAlter/status/1235246862287777792[comment]&gt;Put another way: despite their ideological similarities, if you're still voting for Warren at this point, it means you have deep reservations about Bernie.

&gt;And the way many high-profile Warren supporters have been treated by the Bernie base doesn't help.

&gt;Anecdotally-- I'm hearing from Warren voters saying they now plan to vote for Biden, and that the mistreatment from the Bernie base is a big part of that calculation. They use words like "rude" and "negative" to describe the vibes coming from Bernie camp.
[comment]Frankly she should just endorse Biden at this point. It would do a lot to help unify the party and clear the lane for Biden, allowing us to focus on the general election.
[comment]Looking at this another way: If 50% of Warren supporters would vote for Sanders, and 50% of them would vote for Biden, but if 90% of Sanders voters would vote for Warren, and 10% would vote for Biden, then it would make more sense for Sanders to drop out...
[comment]This fits me really well.   It is almost my exact reasoning.
[comment]God y’all are so intolerable. If you have your way Trump will be re-elected.
[comment]As a Bernie supporter, it's really disappointing to me to see the aggressiveness and attacks coming from fellow Bernie supporters. I think they feel desperate like I do.

My wife is disabled and I work 54 hours a week so I don't think I'm your average Bernie supporter. I feel like running around and yelling at people but that's not how you win people over. I'm just so frustrated with everything.

I will 100% back whoever the Dem nominee is, I just really wish it's either Warren or Bernie. I'm concerned Biden will be harmful to my family if he inherits Trump's massive deficit.
[comment]We're being held hostage by scared children that want to go back to pretending nothing's more concerning that the next episode of Jersey Shore.
[comment]"*sometimes* aggressive base"

Lol!😄
[comment]It still makes me laugh how disillusioned Bernie supporters are on social media. They assume they're always being cheated and bully the supporters of other candidates but get super upset when you stand up to them. Alter is 100% right, most democrats are not ultra-progressives but BBs only feed off each other on reddit and twitter to build up their illusion of dominance. I like Elizabeth Warren and would fully welcome her and her supporters into the Biden camp when she eventually drops out.
[comment]As a Yang supporter I got *extremely* negative vibes from Bernie Bros. I still voted for Bernie, because recognizing healthcare as a human right is far more important than someone being mean to you online.
[comment]Warren's voters are HER voters.  They are not Bernie's by default.  She is not "stealing" his votes.  She has earned *hers*. 

Isn't that what Bernie supporters have said for the last 4 years? You have to "EARN" my vote?

So Bernie and his sycophants, go earn their votes.  Send them some more death threats.  That works wonders.

If a person is still supporting Warren, despite her zero percent chance of winning the nomination, then they have already done the math and decided they aren't willing to jump ship for Bernie.  Period.  Send some more snake emojis their way.  That has really urged them to come to your guy.
[comment]I don’t worry about Warren voters voting blue in November, but it’s Bernie’s base that I’m concerned about.  

Warren should be getting praise today for single handedly ending Bloomberg’s undemocratic run, but instead she’s being harassed online by the far left. If your base is attacking Warren, how do you expect moderates or independents to coalesce around Bernie in Nov?
[comment]I voted for Warren in our primary. I’m a white college educated liberal who thinks she would make a terrific executive even if she isn’t the best campaigner. 

If I had to choose between Bernie and Biden...I’d probably choose Biden. I agree with Bernie’s values but I’m deeply skeptical about his ability to be an effective executive. 

Biden, I just think he would manage not to fuck things up too badly.  Not a ringing endorsement, but light years better than any Republican. 

I’ll be out knocking doors for the winner either way.
[comment]I condemn a lot of the worst behaviour from Bernie supporters but people need to understand that Bernie represents the some of the most disenfranchised and marginalized people in American society. He polls strongest with young people of every race, including black and latino, latinos in general and the working class. These are people who are burdened with debt, lack of job opportunities, unaffordable health care and no path to home ownership. People who have had their unions fall apart and their jobs move overseas. So yes the base is going to be aggressive and a lot of that aggression is out of frustration, that they're watching their future being taken away from them.
[comment]Bracing for the misogynistic backlash against Warren if she doesn’t fully endorse Sanders in *3, 2, 1......*
[comment]I totally understand the Warren fan sentiment, and I get it from Pete and Amy fans too. When Pete bowed out a Bernie Bro posted a meme that called him an offensive name and gloated about this dude dropping out of the race...even if OP was happy in that instance (and what kind of person gains happiness from another's misery?) how stupid do you have to be to alienate potentially displaced voters.

I have posted over on some Bernie subs (I'm a Bernie supporter: surprise!) that Warren's base doesn't owe us a damn thing, it's our job to inspire new votes to come to the booths, but people keep moaning as if Warren's % is going to immediately translate to Bernie when the reality is it would fracture and the majority of it would probably go to Biden. 

Bernie definitely has some immature people making loud noises and doing obnoxious, sometimes grotesque things on the internet and not enough fellow supporters are stopping it, and if some of the Chapo House claims are true, then Bernie's campaign isn't doing enough to stop it. 

For the record I do not believe that Biden has a snowballs chance in hell in beating Trump, but I also don't necessarily know if Bernie does either. Bernie to me, always seemed like someone who could connect with Trump supporters because I always seemed to see him being the one to garner misplaced Trump supporters (and really MI with their open primary in the rust belt will tell wether that's truly possible). But for all of us worried about Trump (and I am one of those worriers) what is alarming more than anything from ST, is just how much of his base showed up for a Primary he already won.
[comment]Imagine being so clueless that you think how someone delivers their message or deals with others is irrelevant in politics. Then imagine also believing you should  run an entire political party.
[comment]Warren voters will not vote for Sanders according to my Twitter feed.
[comment]Dude what ever. Nah sayers. Have some hope.
[comment]I can't bring myself to support either Biden or Bernie. Or any man. I want Warren. She is best prepared to deal with the dumpster fire Trump will leave us. She has proven her understanding of good government. 
If Trump survives to campaign, I will vote for the Democratic nominee. 
I will not canvass, poll or donate. They have demonstrated no interest in women voters. I'm not carrying another man on my back. Warren shouldn't, either. I'd like to see her her say it: we need a different perspective and a trained mind. 
No more white men. Sorry.
[comment]But Biden would be more likely to keep Trump in power than Bernie...
[comment]They will if she drops out and endorses Bernie
[comment]well i like bernie and warren both .. but if the democratic elite (corporate )

try to screw bernie or warren then i am voting for trump .. to heck with the dems .... they have fought for corps to many times and now biden is trying to get in
[comment]I would suspect most of her supporters would back Bernie if she endorses Bernie and starts campaigning for him because if he wins, that means Warren would play a big factor in crafting things like M4A and eliminating student debt in the Senate.

People need to get tougher skin if a few internet trolls bother them that much.
[comment]Biden is Republican lite. Warren railed against him and his ilk and said she would support most of the same policies as Bernie. I cannot fathom  her or her followers supporting Biden over Bernie.
[comment]Sounds like the corporatist talking point of the day.

If they want Trump gone maybe Bidens gaffes and being on both sides of so many issues is worse
[comment]"It would be great if people didn't die when they have no health insurance, but oh dear those people who also want them not to die are so so rude in insisting on them to live, I'll just have to go elsewhere because my tender sensibilities are so much more important."  


I came across a man lying in the middle of the street one morning and I realized he was having a heart attack. I ran to get help, but while help arrived I went back to put my CPR training to the test. I went to give the  man mouth to mouth, but I was immediately aware that he was a heavy smoker because he began expelling black mucous. It was revolting. So I had to ask myself. Are you going to let your squeamishness sentence this man to death?  Hell no. So despite it being completely disgusting I continued the CPR. I was called by the police that afternoon who thanked me for my efforts but that sadly the man passed a few hours latter in the hospital. If I had not done everything in my power to save him I don't know how I could have lived with myself.   


How do these people sleep knowing the death count for their inaction is in the thousands.
[comment]I'm picking the ideologically opposite candidate because some random people were mean to me on the interwebz.

It's funny, democrats are, or should be, fully aware of the Mueller report and the russian propaganda campaign. But when it comes to "Bernie bros", which was orchestrated and continues to be propagated by Russia, not only does the left wing media completely ignore that fact straight from the Mueller report, but democrats themselves seem to just believe every hostile person on the internet is representative of a single candidate.

It's not like Bernie is calling for the burning of churches here. Its literally infuriating that people can actually blow such dumb nonsense out of proportion.

But it serves us right, Democrats didn't want to listen when it came to HC. We continually have no problem nominating people wrapped in scandal-bows for the GOP to dismantle in the general. We just look the other way when Hillary Clinton goes to a private, wealthy gathering and tells them you should have a public and private persona. We just look the other way when CNN is leaking debate questions to her. We just look the other way when she bit-bleached her hardware after it was requested for review. Meanwhile we're suppose to make the case that if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't hide your taxes, Mr. Trump. Yeah, doesn't sound so good.

And now comes Biden. Any Democrat that thinks this entire Burisma thing looks 100% clean is straight up delusional. The GOP told Trump to quiet down and save that ammo for the general. It's the only reason they stopped with Burisma. The republicans are withholding all their attacks. There's more related to Hunter, with Biden voting for bankruptcy bills that Hunter's credit company wanted passed while he was on the board. Meanwhile they'll also push the block Bernie narrative in an attempt to piss off the liberal wing of the party.

I get it; he's better than Trump. But my god can we stop handing Republican's our nominee on a silver platter with an apple in his mouth? 

If we lose this election I'll be expecting a new party, because I won't be voting democrat for the rest of my life if this party fails again at beating this psychopath, and while you're all going to blame the liberal wing, I'm gonna go ahead and blame the rest of you because you're the ones picking the candidates every election. So for the love of God, if Biden wins nomination, you fuckers better make sure he wins, because there will be a mass exodus in this party. Rant done, sorry. Just really pissed about the politics in this country lately. It's been a long 3 years.
[comment]Sorry to say,  Warren was the Queen of Change Her Mind to What Bernie is Doing that Debate........js
[comment]Biden has no chance to beat trump. If she supports him she cares more about pleasing the establishment than her actual positions on any issue.
[comment]Sorry someone is angry at her. this is serious and everyone knows biden=4 more years of trump. So people should be pissed.  If she supports biden she is not progressive, she is establishment.
[comment]I'm so torn over all this because I want a progressive candidate so badly. Warren, unfortunately, did not poll well, and I know for a fact if the previous primaries had gone differently and demonstrated that Warren was trending toward the top I would have certainly relinquished my support for Sanders and went with Warren. I voted for Bernie because I legitimately thought he had the best shot. I strongly believe in what both candidates campaigned for, I just had stronger feelings toward Sanders. The last-minute coalescence of the democrats definitely shifted things in Biden's favor, the outspoken "squeaky wheels" of Sander's supporters, in addition to the lack of young voters coming out all kind created a formula that worked against Sander's campaign.
[comment]That is a cool way to paint Bernie as an extremist ... very cool and so unfair subtly nasty I think.      
Yes quite nasty.     
She doesn't blame it on Bernie but his base, using the same vocabulary as the one used for the Trump goons.    
And of course the base is placed aside to the educated liberals who naturally like Ms Warren ... sorry but I am a little bit educated and I like Mr Sanders.       

She also gives us the practical key work as opposed to what ?  ... solving issues ? Because this is the focus of Bernie's action.      
So the revolution ending shot rings like the bells of the Churches of Petrograd in 1917. But wait Bernie is absolutely not Lenin ... this is not an Alter net reality here.     
No   
And I don't think that Canada or Europe are that much revolutionary and I am quite impressed by their health care system.
[comment]Two words: Russian trolls. Y’all are falling into the exact same trap as 2016.
[comment]If we are practical and want Trump gone above all else, we will ABSOLUTELY support Bernie. Biden is an incoherent mess of a candidate that's on the wrong side of so many progressive issues it's embarrassing.

He is benefiting so much from people not really paying attention to him because other candidates were more fun to talk about. He won't last in actually watched debates.

He is much less likely to win. This panic at Bernie is insane and self destructive. 

I love Warren. She's made some political mistakes that annoy me, but she was my candidate ... until she became unviable. Now I want to win in November. Now I need Bernie to be the nominee.
[comment]Berniecrat here.

I was immediately totally banned from the Warren subreddit for making a common sense suggestion to not make her campaign entirely about her gender.

I don't care what happens to her if they want that kind of policing.

Biden is a million times better than Trump but he'd rather please white nationalists and insurance companies than produce clean progressive legislation.  I'll be voting for Biden if it cones down to that but only for the Supreme Court because anything he tries to do will be gimped by extreme white nationalist oligarchs.
[comment]Count me as one who has been alienated by Bernie's usually aggressive base. I don't buy the "oh they're just passionate" b.s. anymore.
[comment]That could be true. The only thing we know for sure is that warren is NOT a viable candidate in this race. Voters have spoken; she got THIRD in her home state. It doesn’t matter where her supporters go but she needs to drop. It’s a two person race now.
[comment]Boomers have spoken, corporatists have won again and all they had to do was keep crying about anonymous mean comments and pinning them to Bernie.
[comment]I'm one of these people.  I'm voting for Warren on Tuesday, unless she drops out / endorses Bernie.   

At this point, a vote for Bernie is a vote for the tribal infighting that we are clearly not intelligent enough to be above.   

I started feeling cautious optimism this year as things went on - but this is going to be another election of memes.
[comment]Unfortunately, your holy Biden has already lost.
[comment]I’m hoping for Sanders Warren 2020.
[comment]I don't know why anybody would pick Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren. She's actually accomplished things and is exactly the right age to be President.

I also don't know why people would assume that Warren supporters would be more likely to go with Sanders than Biden. Personally, I think a Joe Biden/Elizabeth Warren ticket would create a blue tsunami. I'd like to see Biden and Warren make that deal asap.
[comment]What a cowardly attitude, #OnlyBernieBeatsTrump2020 putting anyone else up there IS the same as voting for Trump. Joe has Dimentia for ffs. Wake the hell up.
[comment]That’s me. I was a Warren voter, now I will back Biden.
[comment]What a load of Orwellian doublespeak. "That Joe Biden is double plus good"!
[comment]“They want Trump gone more than they want a revolution”. You can literally have both, it’s tiring to see the argument that Bernie would lose to Trump. According to [the most recent polls](https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/) Bernie does *better* than Biden against Trump.

##**There is no neutral on a moving train**

If you do not function against Trump's protofascist movement, you function for it. 

Now is when we separate the compassionate and mindful from the credulous and self-absorbed. 

There is no neutral on the racism train either. You can either function against a white supremacist president, or you function as a racist. 

Are you with us, or are you with them?
[comment]And sadly he is correct...after that all bet a are off defeat Trump first. Than whatever impeach Biden I don't care
[comment]I'll always be a Bernie bro, but right now I'm Ridin' with Biden!
[comment]Bernie knows Donald trump is an existential threat to not only Americans, but the world.
[comment]Bernie is a very sensible and moral man. He was never going to throw in with Trump.
[comment]That’s what I’ve been saying and getting down-voted.
[comment]He’s right. Either you vote Biden or you’re voting for Trump (by voting third party or not voting at all).
[comment]Sanders is right. Every time the Democratic candidate has lost it's because someone on the Left split the vote.
[comment]Fuck yeah it is. Thank you Bern!
[comment]Sellout LOL
[comment]I still oppose Biden and the conservative-center of the party. 

I just oppose the GOP a hell of a lot more.
[comment]Anyone who thinks there's no difference between Trump and Biden, or just don't care and want to vote for Trump out of spite, needs to read Trump's 2021 budget. It's an eye opener.

[comment]didn’t reddit call Yang a sellout for endorsing Biden also?
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to influence Biden’s campaign and allow a vision that works for both voter groups.

And fix the SCOTUS.
[comment]You mean that Trump isn’t honoring his commitments? Shocking!! 😱

[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/bernie-sanders-drops-out-of-2020-democratic-presidential-primary.html[comment]I didn’t even get to vote in a primary before everyone dropped out. This is why we need a national primary day instead of a 6 month spread.
[comment]Finally did the right thing, now he needs to get his supporters to vote blue in the general.
[comment]The writing was on the wall.  For better or worse, Biden is the pick now.  I really wish it was a stronger candidate, but I don't buy the narrative that he can't beat Trump.  Trump is very beatable.  We'll see how it goes...
[comment]I’d vote for my dog if I felt like the pup had a chance of taking the White House.  I’d have voted for Bernie had he been the nominee.  My sympathies to his die-hard supporters but there’s only one choice in the matter now.
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to fight hard to oust Trump and also reform healthcare in some way--perhaps not exactly the way he envisioned but in some capacity.
[comment]Fuck, now we have to vote for Biden. Just once I want to vote for someone I want, not against someone I don't.
[comment]No refunds lol
[comment]We should be totally focused on trump now.
[comment]Biden is about as appealing as a bowl of room temperature mayonnaise.
[comment]So let me get this right, he waited till after voters in Wisconsin risked their lives to stand in line for hours during a pandemic to vote overwhelmingly for Biden? Fuck that guy. He's as bad as the anti-amercan Republicans in that state who sued to block the delay of the primary and the criminals on the court who upheld the lawsuit. Fuck them and fuck him.
[comment]sad
[comment]I'm surprised.  Maybe he thought it was best to come together, with the pandemic going on
[comment]Even if I can't elect Bernie, I'll be there to vote against Trump.
[comment]Ah yes, we all end up with what only a few people marginally wanted.

Not a Bernie supporter at all and I do think Biden is the "best bet." But holy shit this is like saying the Oklahoma is the best bet of the Big 12 to win it all - its true but you'd much rather have a top team from any other Power 5 be your team.

My fear is he doesn't have the fight. He's too enlightened centrist to me. When/if the death toll hits 100k, he needs to be vicious in blaming Trump for each one. But I fear he wont' and instead will say shit like, "he did a good job in some areas" or some idiot thing like that.

Is it too late to draft Cuomo?
[comment]Blue. No. Matter. Who.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I liked Bernie. I voted for him in my states primary. But Biden has been winning the primaries left and right. 

Think of it this way. Who would you rather pick the next Supreme Court Justice: Trump or Biden?
[comment]So, for some Bernie supporters, now is the time to ignore what he says is the best thing and that is to get rid of Trump. 

Sounds like that group wasnt supporting Bernie at all.
[comment]Sanders has left the race and I feel that many of us will miss him for better or worst. Now, we must prepare for the republicans to target disillusioned Sanders supporters to vote green, not vote, or vote Trump. They're planning a massive disenfranchisement media movement against us. We need to use our time and energy to email the  Biden campaign and remind them that this race will be consequential and NOT EASY.
[comment]Alright people, it’s time to rally around Biden whether we like it or not!
[comment]Biden should tap Obama for the VP spot

[comment]That’s because it never happened, you cannot pretend that Hillary chose Kaine as her running mate over a progressive that would have appealed to the progressive camp.
[comment]**TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE POSING AS DEJECTED BERNIE SUPPORTERS AND BAD WINNER BIDEN SUPPORTERS. They are desperate for 2020.**
[comment]My hero in politics is out of the race, and it’s really damaging to see it. But I think he put up a good fight, and I hope he falls behind the Democratic Party ASAP and continues the fight in his remaining time in the senate. Vote blue no matter who!

I can't wait to hear the excuses as to why we need another "moderate" aka do nothing, working class people stay broke candidate, 4 years from now.

Maybe we can run Hunter next. Gotta make sure it's a moderate with a scandal and all, too.

Bring on the downvotes nerds.
[comment]Obviously the attacks on Bidens son are entirely reprehensible and I hope whoever the nominee is they strongly condemn them and fight back by pointing out the blatant illegality and ethical failures of the Trump administration in hiring his own children who are woefully under qualified for the positions they hold the time for the moral high ground for Democrats needs to be over. As far as Biden lacking the mental fitness to run the country I fully agree although it should be said so does Trump and we would be a lot safer and more prosperous under Joe no doubt but it's a weakness they will exploit and I fear he would lose. More concerning though is the Republican and Democratic establishments conviction and premature coronation of Biden as the nominee. I hope it doesn't go that way. He is and always has been Republican light with policies and votes going back decades that hurt Democratic values and economically vulnerable people. He won't be able to beat Trump by offering him out behind the woodshed and mixing his lines up. Bernie would be able to as the polling has shown for months by having the mental conditioning of a much younger man and the guts to go where is needed with rhetoric. Shame all of the nominees are old men in their swan songs and a shame so many people are frightened of the only Democratic candidate that espouses traditional Democratic values Joe leaning to the left now is disengenuous and risible.
[comment]I've seen some of this on Reddit already and I'm wondering if it is coming from Russian sources.

[comment]&gt;a bumbling candidate who lacks the mental fitness to run the country.
 Hahshahhahaha Trump is one to talk..no surprise he said this.
[comment]I mean he is bumbling.
[comment]For those of you that are saying that you can't believe what the attacks are going to be like later on here's how it's going to be, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Joe Biden has been around for 40 years, Donald j drumpf has been around in politics going on for years, the dear leader has just as many gaffs and MORE fuck ups than Joe Biden does so that's how it's going to be, the Democrats are going to throw the same shit and then some right back at the orangutan looking POS that we have in Washington because Donald j drumpf deserves everything and then some he gets for being such a right-wing piece of garbage that only cares about himself and not the American people.
[comment]That's been happening for the last year or so.
[comment]They are working on me. I’m voting Dems no matter what but I’ve seen the videos and Biden DOES sound like he’s losing brain function terribly. It’s why I’ve doubled my efforts in phone banking for Sanders. I literally just see him as a slam dunk on Trump.
[comment]That last part is rich, considering we have a bumbling idiot who lacks the mental fitness to run a country currently running the country.

He's also been building ground operations in every state - and will give those to whoever the nominee is, even if it's not him. I don't want him as president, but his money *is* helping us.
[comment]I’m surprised he didn’t just walk off stage. How embarrassing! Warren just proved that she can handle a misogynistic idiot better than anyone.
[comment]This is like that one episode where Piper Perri got surrounded
[comment]He sucks so bad. I was mad that he was being allowed on the debate stage and after tonight I'm happy he was allowed on. Now everyone can see him for what he is. An old out of place rich man who has no clue as to what the american people want or like.
[comment]I actually felt badly for him.     He looked like he was going to cry.  Its sad!!   Whether or not you were planning on voting for him/like him the guy IS a legitimate businessperson and smart as heck (although he didn't come off this way).   He also didn't bully other candidates back (i.e. Trump).
[comment]I never liked Bloomberg jumping into the race, right from the very start. He's way to business as usual for me. But this actually made me feel sorry for the poor bastard.
[comment]You see how fast Mikey's eyes are blinking? How much he stammers to force out an answer that he had to come up with on the spot? He's not ready for primetime, and he never will be. All of the money in the world will never change that fact, because money isn't what makes you an ideal candidate. What makes you an ideal candidate is to not be a festering bag of shit.
[comment]I am wondering who, if anyone, Bloomberg will support with his $ if he drops out.  I think Amy and Pete are the only ones who didn't absolutely destroy Bloomberg.

Hurr Durr. Don't divide democrats lmao
[comment]That was both satisfying and painful to watch. No thanks Bloomberg, weve already got one billion dollar bonehead in there White House. 

 No need for another.
[comment]Let’s be real here. His misconduct was out there before this debate. His supporters aren’t the type of people who watch the debates, they’re the type of people who judge based on political ads that come on during their favorite shows. He won’t pick up any new supporters from his performance tonight but I doubt he’ll lose many
[comment]This dude brought 300k to a knife fight and didn’t think he’d get stabbed. I bet he’s feeling a little MeToo’d right now, gonna need everyone to sign an NDA after his performance tonight.
[comment]"they were made consensually" 

The exact same argument Harvey Weinstein is making, what a joke.
[comment]No one went after Sanders, at all. So the race is exactly where it was yesterday. Sanders is going to cruise to the nomination
[comment]Now that the intervention is over its time to get on with life.
[comment]Nobody can possibly watch this and take anything positive out of Bloomberg’s performance. The man was actively being booed by the crowd whenever he talked.
[comment]I need a clip of this on my workout playlist.
[comment]Didn’t realize Bloomberg had three anuses: his natural one, the one on his face where all the shit comes out, and the new one that Warren ripped him last night!
[comment]This debate was like a trial run at how these guys would debate Trump. Sanders, Warren and even Biden looked like killers tonight. Especially, Warren she absolutely left bodies on the ground. 

Pete looked like a guy who didn’t want to anger the guy with the money too much. 

Klobichar looked like a parent who was going to abuse her middle school child when they got home for talking back to her in public
[comment]Wow, skewered, you can literally watch him shrink into himself like a little troll.
[comment]Please tag nsfw because of elder abuse
[comment]I can’t forgive stop and frisk at all. And all those NDAs with all the women who want to come forward?!? And he’s so transphobic too
[comment]I really think he’s there to save the Democrats from going full left and alienating the public into voting Trump in for another four years
[comment]“binders full of women!”
[comment]Big props to Bernie Sanders here for not engaging in the personal mudslinging and bringing it back to policy at the end. There's a reason why this dude would be a great leader but a not so great politician. The man has class
[comment]Why everybody envy someone who tries to get ahead ..is nobody get rich then the only rich people would be the old money...no upper middle class just poor n rich....So now is anybody going to hate me for having a couple of millions in the bank which i work hard for it..Or they would be happy to see me getting food stamp n Medicaid like most deplorables do...Envy is not a good trade!!!!
[comment]As god as my witness, he is broken in half
[comment]That wad brutal af to even watch
[comment]I feel like every pther candidate got together before the debate and said "let's take this fucking guy out tonight"
[comment]He'll keep going on.  He's rich, entitled, and immune to the criticism.
[comment]Not wasted. I think he should keep the ads making fun of trump rolling.
[comment]That was the longest curb theme song I’ve ever heard.
[comment]#OnlyBernieBeatsTrump2020 Warren and all the rest have to many skeletons in their closets. And their all running on Bernie lite anyway. No thank you I will take my Revolution strait up from the source.
[comment]He got destroyed. But, people are idiots. Lets just hope he doesn't do well when the votes are casts.  Trump got murdered also in debates.
[comment]Massive donation to the sanders campaign
[comment]Someone needs to make/share a subtitled facebook video showing all of the bad bloomberg debate clips back-to-back, so the boomers that get all their debate deets from FB can see he's not the person from his ads.
[comment]As seen on the internet - that man brought a wallet to a knife fight.
[comment]That is the face of a man who's realizing he just blew a quarter billion dollars to get roasted onstage.
[comment]“They want to keep it quiet” - keep “it” quiet? What event do they want to keep quiet?? Does he realize his wording makes him seem even more like he has something to hide?
[comment]He was absolutely destroyed, I bet he won't make it through march
[comment]Biggly
[comment]News Media- "If Bloomberg keeps paying us for ads, he will recover from this"
[comment]Did you ever see a more disinterested looking guy as Bloomberg was last night?  That said, IF he is the nominee, I’ll vote for him as Trump MUST go!
[comment]He deserves to be NAILED for these non disclosure agreements and Trump does as well.  Keep your eyes on the prize Trump's figurative head on a pike.
[comment]That was beautiful, get this Republican pos poser out of here.  If he was so scared of Bernie he should have injected money into his opponent's campaigns, but now he has radically increased the likelihood of Bernie having enough delegates in July to prevent a brokered convention.
[comment]I really hope there is polling post this debate and prior to Saturday's caucus. Bloomberg's numbers are likely to drop ten points. I think Sanders holds steady or gains a point or two and Warren gains five points or more.
[comment]I haven't seen a murder like that since the Charles Manson cultists hit the Tate house.
[comment]I think he did fine but then I don’t use Twitter where I need to be told by others how to think, so there’s that.
[comment]If he can’t handle Warren, he has no business getting in the ring with Trump. 

Hillary took the high road too often in the debates; I am so looking forward to watching someone who can swing back
[comment]Has more money than all the previous presidents combined, tells everyone else what to do with their money.... Pay for the free school and healthcare your self and I will not for you
[comment]LOL...Glad to see that a lot of Democrats can also see Mikey, for what he is.

Can I ask a quick question please?

Why do Democrats keep shooting themselves in the foot?
[comment]Fuck Mikey Boomburp
[comment]Did anyone catch what the hecklers were saying when Biden began his closing statement?  I couldn't make out what they were trying to say.  I did hear the Biden supporters begin to counter-chant, "Joe! Joe!" to try to drown them out.  But I didn't hear what the protesters/hecklers were yelling to begin with.  Anyone know?
[comment]Biden with that old man arm grab haha
[comment]He's still in it. He's still taking votes from mostly moderates, he is a spoiler, good for Trump and Sanders. Bad for Pete Joe and Amy
 Its ironic how he argues how last night was good for Trump, well he is the reason
[comment]It's funny listening to commercials that Bloomberg raised salaries 43% for teachers... In what reality? I taught in New York City under his reign.   He was awful for teachers and teacher salaries
[comment]Why the hell is he doing this to himself? Lmao

[comment]Bloomberg: "I can't be sexist, I have a female friend."
[comment] Bloomberg is a terrible candidate. Why would he waste so much money when he has so much political baggage.
[comment]Poor Mini Mike
[comment]He got his ass handed to him and it only cost him 50 billion$
[comment]Absolutely love the fact that he thought he'd just walk on stage and own the debate because he bought his way there. NOPE! He got what he deserved.
[comment]The debate performance means very little. He’ll still blanket the airwaves to rewrite the narrative about his debate performance. As long as he can convince people that he will be a good leader, they won’t care about his debate performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]"Ever wonder why Trump supporters ignore his countless lies? Because they think like 5 year olds"
[selftext]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYnHE6kfsaM[comment]Yeah sums these Troglodytes pretty good
[comment]Great video. It is so true that people don't care about the lies. Tried to convince my office that a leader speaking truth on TV matters and they just reply with "all of them lie." It's so disappointing and frustrating. 

Unfortunately I don't think Biden can effectively do what the video suggests against the incumbent.
[comment]Yup I don't know how this guy does it.
[comment]Well done.
[comment]They tend to say “it doesn’t matter “ and that they know what he means/meant but seriously he doesn’t know what he means so how can they????
[comment]that doesn't make sense.  if they aren't using logic and reason to support Trump, hitting back with policy won't do jack shit.    They don't care.

Ya gotta use emotion, and the one thing those people understand is being mocked and laughed at.  Biden's 'world leader's are laughing at us' is powerful because of this.   You don't have to 'go low', just have to show reality.  But he'll still get about 40% of the vote, no matter what.
[comment]You know what else suck’s?
[comment]Because they're liars.
[comment]I don't really buy that in that it's endemic to Republican followers. I've seen my share of Democrat asshatery.
[comment]It would ba a shame if democratic party would have the candidate that is electable rather than the candidate with substance and policy...
[comment]Nothing anyone does is ever going to move the needle below 32%. That’s all he needed last election. What we need is to reach people who normally don’t vote or who flipped from Bernie to trump last time. That’s it. Little else is worth discussing.
[comment]I disagree with the video.  Policies won't win over trump voters because they don't care about policies.  They just want to win.  They see it's a my team vs your team and they don't care how they get the W.
[comment]Fox News does this also. Tune in at any random moment and chances are you will get very little factual information, and endless appeals to your emotional logic- mainly anger and a sense of injustice and victimization. No matter what is happening in the world, you are the victim and trump is the victim. Trumps been the victim of the covid crisis on Fox since day one, regardless of the fact that his handling of it has cost countless people their lives- them of course being the actual victims. I guess there’s really no way to combat this unless you can somehow force their viewers to be smarter.

So what was the point of humiliating all those kids with IQ tests since the beginning of modern education?

What am I missing here?
[comment]I think people like know that he's lying, but they feel like they're lying with him to other people, not being lied to.
[comment]Wow. Although Trump and his supporters are far worse, this person's reasoning here is actually rather poor! It really needs to be gone over. Ditto psychiatrists in general as regards Trump, and the most prevalent psychiatric and lay diagnosis of "narcissism". It's amazing that such a thoughtful sounding analysis (if that's what it is; it's really more of a summary of things) can itself, in turn, be systematically flawed.

It's important to realize that people have been diagnosing the Trump phenomenon for as long as he's been in the public and political theaters. Not much of what she is saying is new. This general range of analyses has also been strikingly unsuccessful in budging his base. We really should hold the analyses at least suspect before assuming it's just an intractable problem. But that's a more general, superficial basis for questioning. An attentive listener can see more substantive reasons why her thinking here has serious problems.
[comment]Name Biden policies without mentioning Trump? 
Look this is why I tell people Biden already lost the general. No ground game, no phone banks, No support except msm astroturfing. To America, my land, I say Good Luck!
[comment]Eh, got through 60s of waiting for the point...
[comment]And they yell too.
[comment]The Brain development argument seems true. Have you ever tried to reason with a 5 year old who is having a fit?
[comment]let them roam around free, absolutely facilitate their public meetings and try not to discredit the president's opinion about drinking bleach or overexposing to UV. 

Just magically in a couple of months there will be definitely a lot less of these retards.
[comment]Well I wanted to watch it but then I saw TYT and said nevermind.
[comment]This is why I thought Warren was the best chance Democrats had to beat him.
[comment]President Tide Pods has lost it. He’s completely insane now.
[comment]What's funny is, if Obama did ANY of what Trump has done Republicans would be marching on Washington calling for him to be removed from office. It never ceases to amaze me how much what people think change when a Republican is the one doing it.
[comment]As a people we cultivated and allowed these adults to develop this way and now we get what we deserve.
[comment]Good video, although the last minute or so with her analysis on Hillary’s loss is ridiculous.
[comment]We need to build time-out centers in every shitty backwater town where these inbreeds show they’ve learned that the only difference between being five and being an adult is that you can get away with being a dickhead as an adult. There’s no way to win with idiots.
[comment]Yes.  There is a role for policy and strategy which he won't understand or be able to counter.

But I agree with Bill Maher that Dems need to be less nice.  Trump is going to hit below that belt pretty hard.  He banks on his opponents weaknesses and shadiness.  To think we can remain "better than him" morally and kinder and expect to win is crazy.  Dems need to sling some mud too...and he's given us mountains of it to fling right back at him!
[comment]Trump is a product of right-wing media, stop blaming the people. He is just a symptom of a greater problem, Neo-Liberals and Liberals attacking each other will not help to win the battle against right-wing media.
[comment]Of course. Appeal to emotion. Cognitive dissonance between feelings of inadequacy and superiority. It’s the same with conspiracy theory nuts, cultism and religion.  Its typically just a way of resolving ones inadequate self image with their desired image. 

Very simply, it’s just people trying to make themselves feel better about themselves. “Team trump”. “#winning”. “Own the libs”

You see it in republican policies too. It’s always about not letting anyone else get anything extra. It’s about applying negative consequences to others. 

Its people with damaged egos. It’s pretty easy to see. 

“I don’t care if it’s true; it makes me feel better” 

Also, side note. It sure sounds like the suggested solution to fight trump is exactly what Bernie Sanders is. Fight with policy and details.
[comment]1. Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of 3 Million. She lost the Electoral College and she lost it by less than a million votes in states that are usually a Democratic win, like Pennsylvania and Michigan.

2. The voters who support Trump no matter what, who show up to his rallies, who proudly wear their MAGA hats everywhere, the DEPLORABLES, make up only 50% or less of Trump supporters. WE CANNOT WIN THEIR SUPPORT and shouldn't even try.

3. The voters we can appeal to are the ones who voted for Obama, but either voted for Trump OR DIDN'T VOTE AT ALL. They are the people who hated Trump, but voted for him because they hated Clinton more. 

I never understood why so many people hated Hillary on such a personal level, but I can't deny they exist. That was baggage that IMHO, made her a bad candidate. 

I don't think there is a big group of Biden haters. I don't think he has that kind of baggage. I don't think most people really care about Hunter Biden. The sexual assault allegations are disturbing, but even if they are true, compared the Trump, Biden is a choir boy.

The Electoral College is a terribly unfair system and always has been. We're stuck with it until they can pass a constitutional amendment against it, and that's not going to happen any time soon. Ultimately, Biden needs to appeal to swing voters in swing states and we need a strong GOTV effort. The wider margin we can win by, the harder it will be for Trump and the GOP to cheat their way to a win.
[comment]I posted another comment but I decided to let this one stand alone. 

This information is not a surprise. It’s the fundamental pillar of their entire strategy. All the misinformation and attempts to shape public opinion so blatantly. 

It started with Steve Bannon and World of Warcraft. He realized there exists a population of people who feel like they aren’t good enough or the world is screwing them over. This original group was the Incels on World of Warcraft. 

Bannon realized these people would manipulate their reality in order to make themselves look better to others, and feel better about themselves. After all, pretending, lying or fabricating a whole life story is pretty easy anonymously on the internet. 

So he created Cambridge Analytica. This combined with existing misinformation systems, namely Russian Internet Agency, was a great weapon to manipulate people into achieving your own goals. 

It’s truly fascinating how effective this has worked, and frightening what may come in the future.

Edit:  their image of trump is a rich and famous person who has power over everyone and gets to “stick it” to those who “are mean” to him.  If I become rich and famous and powerful, “I can finally make other people feel crappy about themselves, like I do.”  “I can finally feel like I am better than others.”  This is the ultimate dream of his supporters. 

It’s like a kid who was bullied In school dreaming of becoming a famous fighter.
[comment]Oh yeah, anyone who has discussed anything political with a trump cultist irl finds that out real quick when they stop trying to have any kind of coherent discussion and go into full spittle flinging rage yelling while waving their hands.
[comment]Did she just say that Trump supporters have the reasoning of a 5 year old, rely on emotion, don't listen to reason.... and the only way to combat that is with substance and policy?

If they don't listen to substance and don't care about policy, how is countering Trump with substance and policy a winning strategy?
[comment]Honestly they aren't even human beings. They are a disease that must be destroyed before it can spread
[comment]Yeah! Hillary never lied!
[comment]My dad can beat up your dad!!
[comment]I'm going to disagree. Facts are good, but the trumpie cultists also need to be publicly shamed and humiliated. People need to laugh at them. This will deter the weakminded from joining them.
[comment]"When you are overcome with powerlessness, this type of cartoonish, exaggerated force is often more important than true ability".

You have to make fun of him and make him appear weak.
[comment]No, they act stupid like trumbo because he gives them license to, been like that since the election 😆
[comment]Oh Biden’s definitely losing then
[comment]That's me - "CRYY... 'in. The blues!"
[comment]The sad thing is, appealing with policy doesn't work. Bernie appealed with policy. Voters who supported Trump in 2016 don't care about policy. It doesn't appeal to them. If it did, they wouldn't have voted for a candidate whose entire platform was built on identifying and eradicating an "other".

The only surefire way to convince Trump voters to abandon him is for them to feel like he's abandoned them. Unfortunately, COVID-19 may well have that effect by virtue of killing tens of thousands of people.

As much as I want stay-at-home orders to remain in effect until the threat is manageable, the political consequence of a secondary or even tertiary spike in the death toll is that voters likely to make an emotional decision in the voting booth will feel abandoned. It shouldn't take a massive death toll to make these folks see reality, but I don't think any other threat can have that effect.

You can't shoot a virus. You can't vote against it. You can't write a law to stop it or make a deal with disease. There's no military or policy action that makes it go away.
[comment]I really think she came to the wrong conclusion.  As the first parts of the video explain, Trump's supporters don't care about substance, they care about the appearance of power.  They care about the way he makes them feel strong after having spent so long feeling weak.  Clearly the long way to beat Trump is to empower these people in some other more constructive way and clearly the short way to beat Trump is to have him publicly cast down in such a way that his illusion of power is forever shattered in the eyes of his followers.
[comment]So.... Bernie then?????
[comment]This is an insult to my 5 year old daughter.  She’s way more emotionally intelligent than that.
[comment]Cuomo already knows how to do this. I hope Biden gets it.
[comment]it would have been more effective to keep interviewing trump supporters
[comment]Most of them have the intellect of a 5 year old.
[comment]I have VERY little respect for Trump and his blind followers who can’t think for themselves. Maybe I will if they can advance their thinking to at LEAST a 10-year-old’s level, but now? Can’t stand them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Joe Biden on Twitter: I don't care who you're supporting, attacks like this against a man who could be the first Jewish President are disgusting and beyond the pale. Hatred and bigotry have no place in America — and it's up to all of us to root out these evils wherever they're found.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1236023348481724416[comment]Amen.
[comment]Well said, Joe. 

We may disagree on policy or who the better candidate is, but what happened at that rally is what we all, no matter what side of the party you align with, are fighting against: racism, bigotry, hatred, and fascism. I stand behind either candidate and the objective of taking down Donald Trump and purging this government of his toxic criminal influence.
[comment]Amen Joe.
[comment]Like Republicans Joe? Like Republicans?
[comment]Now if only Bernie would shut down those BernieBots...
[comment]This is the unity Joe brings. Thank you!
[comment]100% agree, just wish it had come sooner.
[comment]Great words. It's time we got above this crap. 

Problem is with the interwebs, some of it is catfishing.
[comment]This shows what a decent man he is. This is the man we want in the White House, not our current nightmare
[comment]Thanks, Joe.
Still voting Bernie
[comment]Joe has my vote!
[comment]This was strategic but still a good thing to do.  Thanks Joe.

Still voting Bernie
[comment]Correct.
[comment]When are people going to wake up and realize all this hate, bigotry, racism, homophobia talk is just a tactic. It’s working too and that’s why it has so much power. If people would quit buying into it then maybe we could all move forward. I live in the South and I’ve met Very few actual racist/homophobes types and the ones I have everyone all agrees they suck, but it’s very uncommon! Except on the news......think about it
[comment]hatred and bigotry are all the right has. its the theme of every one of trumps klan rallies
[comment]Wonder what Trump 's tweet about it would be
[comment]Joe's quickly becoming electable
[comment]Seems like a stunt.  Who was that guy ans what was he paid?
[comment]I don't know where the original story is but just r by eading some of the posts I can tell what it was about, but the best thing that I read other than Joe biden's comment is the Bernie supporters that said they would support whoever is the nominee. No bulshit, this is the first time that I've seen on Reddit or anywhere else that Bernie backers will back the nominee no matter who it is and this is what the Democratic party is all about. The main goal is to get the orange orangutan looking POS out of office,and the only way we can do that is if we unite as a party no matter who the nominee is. This is the last thing I always say after a post, if Bernie wins Democrats that didn't vote for him get some of what they want, if Biden wins the Democrats that didn't vote for him get something they want, but if the orange wannabe dictator wins we get nothing we want!! DEMOCRATS STICK TOGETHER!!
[comment]Thanks, Joe.  👍

I will vote for you and fight hard for you if you win, but I'm still primarying Bernie.
[comment]This is what a real man looks like. joe biden has mine vote. Does he have yours?

Vote BLUE NO MATTER WHO. unite to fight the alt right.
[comment]Bernie was all about unity at his rally tonight too.  He did a good job of saying “we’re in this together and he has my support but here’s why I’m better.”  They’re aware of what R u ss i a is doing and doing a great job of combatting it.  Remember that.  If it seems divisive, consider it before agreeing flatly with it.
[comment]To bad he can't say a sentence this eloquently.
[comment]I’m happy that he’s being classy and humble. That’s the only way we can defeat trump. Unity
[comment]I voted for Warren. No regrets. And no matter which of these two wins the primary, I have money and and volunteer time ready to go during the run up to the general. This is the most important election of my life as an eligible voter.
[comment]Tell 'em, Joe!
[comment]We have to pull together and vote for the nominee. Even if it’s Biden. I hate these nazi scumbags and especially that nazi pos in the WH
[comment]I'm not supporting Biden in the primaries, but this right here is the reason why we have to support him if he becomes the nominee. The difference between him and Trump could not be more clear.
[comment]Found directly at the Whitehouse in Washington DC where the orange maggot lives
[comment]I see people talking about Elizabeth Warren and to be honest I don't agree with all her policies but I don't agree with all of anyone's 100%, but she's closer to what I would vote for if I wasn't voting for Biden and that's because she is an extremely smart person and she's a hell of a debater she's not afraid to tell people what she's really thinking and I respect that in a person whether male or female, and I also said and some of you may disagree but some of you may agree, I think if Biden were to win the nomination he needs to pick a woman as a running mate and I said he should take Warren that way we keep the progressive happy and the moderates happy and can possibly phase in some of the progressive things that people are looking for but then I'm thinking of another woman named Stacey Abrams from Georgia who ran for governor and got it stolen from her but the only drawback I see from Stacey Abrams is that she ran for governor and lost, and I don't know if shes held office before in Georgia or not and another thing is I believe Joe Biden has the African American vote as of now which any Democrat that runs for office needs and Stacey Abrams could possibly bring in the womens vote that any Democrat running also needs, but Elizabeth Warren brings a different part of the party in which expands it to voters that wouldn't normally vote for Biden or that side of the party but in closing I don't think he can go wrong with either choice but it has to be a woman.
[comment]I had no idea he was Jewish
[comment]The comments which are now deleted were vile. I'm disheartened. If you cannot look at a man condemning anti-Semitism and say simply say "Good": Fuck you, you don't belong in this party.
[comment]Good!

I like Joe but I don't think he can beat trump and I worry about his memory.  

But the above message is exactly the thing Trump should be saying.  It's how a leader behaves!

Well done Joe and while you're on a role...

...Biden own campaign recently told Sanders, Nina Turner , shouldn't be using Martin Luther King Jr  quotes which is kind of ...let's say odd.  

So I'd next like to see Biden explain that behaviour , as again that is the type of action we need to see from potential leaders. 

 Stop all the racism and bigotry from the top up!
[comment]This was a tough one, but Joe found the courage to step up and say nazis are bad, regardless of who he might offend. That’s presidential behavior right there.
[comment]I wonder if he apologized to the woman he called, "lying, dog faced, pony solider", or for fondly reminiscing about being so civil with white segregationists or for the Biden buckaroos harassing Warren supporters in the past.  He is a decent man, but has always been at the bottom of my list.
[comment]I voted for Bernie in my primary, but I will definitely vote for Biden if he becomes the nominee. My first choice is Bernie, but I do admit I worry about whether or not the Medicare for All pitch will do well in the general election. I like the idea myself, but America doesn’t like huge changes like that.
[comment]What were the attacks?
[comment]Nicely said Joe. I can’t vote or anything (and sorry, would vote for sanders in the primary if I could), but still, nice.
[comment]Niw here is a decent man who in despite of his attacks from Sanders still defend Sanders jewish ancestry...would Sanders do the same? ??? NO
[comment]We need to unite and rally behind whoever gets the nomination. We have one single goal thisncycle: defeat trumpism. 
  
Also, saving the ACA and pre-existing conditions.
  
And stopping the stacking of the courts.
 
And restoring environmental regs.

And tackling climate change.
  
I mean: I want Medicare for all but I’ll be a fucking deadman if I lose my ACA coverage.
  
Put your main effort into your local, state, senate and house candidates. If you can get someone to to polls for the senator, they’re going to vote the D at the top of the ticket too.
[comment]And people say antisemitism doesn't exist.
[comment]Warren’s dropping out broke my heart, but I am also voting Blue no matter who.
ABT!
[comment]Well said Joe. I really liked how Bernie handled it too. I think you are out numbered.
[comment]Can anybody explain to me why Joe Biden has 8 sexual harassment allegations against him?

<|startoftext|>[title]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how pathetic and awful a significant amount of republicans are?
[selftext]Like it was obvious before but Jesus now it’s slapping you in the face. The protests, the shooting, the denial of basic science, the worship of trump blatantly without any backing, the insecurity, it really shows it off.[comment]Yes
[comment]No, we already knew that. This just confirms it.
[comment]Not exposed; just confirmed it in bright neon.
[comment]It confirms that many Republicans have decided to listen to their lesser angels, stop thinking, go with their emotions and follow an insane cult leader to where ever he takes them next.
[comment]Karma will surely serve them a plate of covefe 19...😆
[comment]This is literally all they've ever been. Even the corporate sellouts in our camp have the decency to at least pretend they care about human life.
[comment]Hatefulness has a political party. It's never been more obvious.
[comment]Yes. I’ve been trying to assume the point of view of trumpists/republicans and I caught myself thinking: The way we view them is most likely the way they view us. They’re incapable of seeing the light. They look at us like we’re the bad guys just like we view them. Just a thought.
[comment]Yes. The surprise is how many Democrats this has exposed as not having the best interests of the people or the Democratic process in mind. Our system is truly broken and beyond repair.
[comment]They deserve to lose every election for the next hundred years. As it is, we will be lucky to squeeze out four years of doing next to nothing to halt their eventual progress.
[comment]I think it was perfectly obvious before Covid-19...but maybe that's just me? 🤔
[comment]You could have groups shooting people in the streets and there would still be a good amount of money and power supporting them because it's more profitable to have the American people fighting each other
[comment]Of the two parties- only the GOP tries to suppress the vote. Limit voting places, eliminate vote by mail, cut hours, get rid of existing early voting... the ID law is “problematic” but really its about suppressing the vote. Winning in that way- cheating- is without honor.
[comment]C19 has VALIDATED HOW COMPLETELY VILE THE REPEWBS ARE.    BLUE WAVE!
[comment]Just par for the course really. Money rules that party and you are a means for them to get richer. 

If anything, I hope it made people realize that the party is supposed to work for us and not the other way around. 

As well, the rich showed everyone that we’re worth a hell of a lot more that what we’re getting paid!
[comment]I mean, basically everything that has happened in the last 4 years has shown that. This is par for the course.
[comment]Absolutely. And I hope we don’t forget it once we get Trump out of office. We might be friendly for now with “moderate Republicans” who hate Trump, but DO NOT forget how their worldview is based on dangerous nonsense as well. 

Healthcare is a human right. Climate change is real. Immigrants make our country stronger in nearly every way. Women have a right to their own bodies. Voting rights matter. The GOP denied these fundamental truths long before Trump took office and they will do so even after he leaves.
[comment]It was already confirmed. This just reinforces it.
[comment]From my perspective, it's just been pouring lemon juice marinated salt into the gaping wound. However to the uninformed voter or blatantly partisan GOP voter I feel this won't even remotely be a blip on their radar, it's all some conspiracy to down Trump or some shit
[comment]I don’t think it needed confirmation.
[comment]I don't think anyone has the market cornered on bad decisions. Covid 19 just adds insult to injury.
[comment]They really have shown their true colors
[comment]Coronavirus isn't in human form and they can't apply the politics of personal destruction to something that can't speak, show compassion to marginalized people, or convey ideas that would make lives better for more than the super rich.

There is no straw man that can be made here.  It doesn't care about your politics and it also can't be vilified so Skeeter can say he's mad it wore a tan suit or "What about the coronavirus's emails?!!" in a feigned fit of outrage.
[comment]We as Democrats need to FINALLY grow a sack and play the game on the same terms as they are or they will just continue on doing whatever the hell they want as they have been doing since the 1970’s.....😔
[comment]Conservatives subreddit is absolute cancer
[comment]Yes! A lot of Trumpicans can't bear the thought that their leader has fumbled this crisis hard so they shun reality and the science behind it. And as we've seen from the armed protests and two pipebomb arrests, they're willing to get real nasty with their beliefs. To say the least, It's a scary time in America and I'm worried if/when Biden wins in November. I have a feeling Trump isn't relinquishing power easily.
[comment]Republicans have been this awful my entire life. I feel like younger people just were totally not exposed to them on such a massive scale under the previous 8 years of Obama.
[comment]The insecurity is borne by the realization that this is the nail in Trump's coffin. Up till the coronavirus, nothing seemed to stick to Trump. This crisis has laid that bare his ineptitude and every poll shows him losing badly to Biden. They are freaking out and will only get more strident.
[comment]Known for a while now
[comment]You better VOTE!!!
[comment]We already knew lol. We can only hope it’s been exemplified to those who are more moderate. I think what’s it’s really shown is blind loyalty to party lines, with complete and total disregard for human lives. 

People and politicians who are acting like total a**holes in all of this. The ones disobeying mandates, violating and compromising the health and well-being of others, simply to “shove it” in the face of Democrats. It is pathetic and awful. How many lives have been lost as a result of it? We’ve definitely seen the ugly side of humanity in all of this.
[comment]I wasn’t surprised just very, very irked. You see, I literally prayed that no crisis would happen with this administration because they would literally make matters much, much worse. They have far exceeded my expectations.


Pls Vote in November.
[comment]It's been obvious for a while but this has hopefully exposed how awful conservatives are to anybody who was considering voting against their own best interests and voting for them
[comment]It exposed just how terrible our government as a whole is. To say one half did amazing while the other half did piss poor is quite off base. It’s not cute when they’re in Washington bickering like children over legislation. They all get a huge thumbs down from me.
[comment]Thing that gets me is the fear based denial. And then they'll roll over and play the victim just to blame you for exercising a measured response for dealing with the fearful reality of a global pandemic.
[comment]The mental gymnastics required to support Trump and his boot-lickers at this point are truly mind boggling.
[comment]Yes. Yes I do.
[comment]Pressure exposes patterns.
[comment]"Your deaths for rich people are a sacrifice I am more than willing to make." /Republicans more or less (Probably)
[comment]I don't think it's fair to compare as Democrat vs Republican. I typically vote red but I'm still at home and don't agree with the protesting idiots and I also wouldn't call myself a republican. I think a significant amount of those "republicans" are just people who operate from their lower brain and spout Trump as their savior. Can you really be so far in one camp or the other to label yourself?

I guess my thought is that I wish people were more idea/policy leaning than red/blue team leaning. I've never voted a straight ticket...
[comment]Nah, I’ve always known.
[comment]Depends on how sensitive you are to this sort of thing.

If you are highly sensitive, the way they handled Monica Lewinsky would have tipped you off.

If you were just sensitive, the way Bush handled 9/11 and the Iraq War would have tipped you off.

If you were moderately interested but not sensitive to this sort of thing at all, the financial crisis and the nomination of Sarah Palin as Veep candidate would have tipped you off.

If you had a passing interest, the way they reacted to Barack Obama should have tipped you off.

If your interest wasn't passing but you had any awareness, their backing of the Orange Shitgibbon and his actions prior to Covid-19 should have tipped you off.

If you don't know by now either you are one of them or you have your head up your ass and like it there, because nothing bad ever comes to your ears.
[comment]I think the absolute craziest part for me is that there are people out there that not only are on with this but support it in a full throated manner
[comment]Yes. Everyday Every second Every issue
[comment]I think it’s exposed how pathetic and awful a lot of people are
[comment]All. All of them.
[comment]Hey, what did they do to the CDC? I'm serious. They have been muzzled. I see a 70+ year old man who constantly respeats himself &amp; occasionally a doctor or 2, but why hasn't the CDC been on TV?
[comment]Imagine you could see all the headlines of just this year about what the GOP and trump has done during the 2016 election. 

Think “Her Emails” would have been an issue?
[comment]I’ve seen quite a bit of bigotry of late. Almost exclusively from my non democrat friends. I was surprised at how many self described independents have hate as well
[comment]Ok, I'll bite. 

I'm probably closest to a republican as things go... How does this expose anything?
[comment]I think Trump did that. Before he came along I thought they deserved a seat at the table.
[comment]You're just saying that because you want your party to be in power.

/S
[comment]No. Definitely not. It exposed how underestimating we we were.
[comment]I agree with the general sentiment, but Biden is still running for President and still does not support Medicare for all, even as hundreds of thousands die from Covid, many of them un or under insured. I’d say the Republicans are not the only ones who have been exposed.
[comment]Conservative here. There is a reason I call myself a conservative and not a republican. The Republican Party platform contradicts itself on so many instances I just can’t. I still hold right wing views, but I actually try not to contradict my own beliefs unlike the people in DC.
[comment]it has shown me how pathetic ALL our politicans are.  driven by party politics and greed.
[comment]I’m not sure you noticed, but they elected a human toilet after previously electing/not electing the world most dangerous nerf ball for two illegitimate terms
[comment]It shows that both parties don't care about us. Not just Republicans. Do you guys really think the Democrats are working for you and not there corporate donors?
[comment]You mean every day*
[comment]Every damn week, they find a new bottom.
[comment]Whats just as bad is people believing whatever they are told. This ridiculous "Plandemic" video has gotten me in trouble with family because it makes me so angry that they watch and believe what these nutjobs are saying!
[comment]Every day the indecency is more obvious. If Americans were really the kind of people that I grew up thinking they were, the GOP would be obliterated NOW.
[comment]People in general...
[comment]No .
[comment]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how stupid and awful a significant amount of Democrats are?
[comment]Lol you're just speaking the truth based on facts.

No think.

The covid massacre has shown 1) how fucking dangerous China under xi really is.  2) that trump really has no empathy.  3) that his supporters are brainwashed and or evil.  4) the gop are fucking terrorists and traitors who put human life after personal gain.  5) America is heading towards it's 3rd civil war.
[comment]I feel like it’s not fair to make a general statement that states all republicans are like this. While I disagree with many, and think some are complete fucking idiots. I think the same thing for some of the people in the other parties as well. There are stupid people everywhere, and good people from both sides exist.


But yeah, the people protesting, fuck them, absolute cunts to be honest. Also trump worshippers need to cease existing and as a side note, who the fuck protests their second amendment rights while protesting a quarantine?
[comment]No I’ve know for near thirty years how gross pathetic and awful republicans and conservatives are. They are a blight and cancer on this nation and in their own way a population forcing the rest of us to be better and confront the awfulness that is a hallmark of their ideology.
[comment]Have you seen r/trump? My god the people on that sub are small but make up for it ok stupidity.
[comment]just wondering what platform they will campaign on in future elections. they have flipped on everything.no morals,abortion,military/injured vets,law enforcement,health insurance. hell, i can't think of one thing oh,one thing, enriching wall street.
[comment]I really want to caution anyone who will listen from adopting this attitude. At the end of the day, we are all citizens of this country, and we have to figure out a way to work together to overcome obstacles. 

Are there some really shorty republicans elected officials right now? I would say yes. This is most likely due to the fact that republicans more commonly get elected, and received a lot of the money from the early days of lobbying, now just about anyone with a seat of power gets paid to make decisions.

We the people are the ones who control whether these officials get to remain in power, and alienating our fellow citizens is no way to go about effecting change. I encourage everyone to be open minded, and try to understand where the rhetoric comes from. It may not being what you agree with, and it may be preachy and shorty and unpleasant, but we all have humanity, and we all need to work together to overcome our hardships.
[comment]You know how they say that money doesn't change a person but rather exposed who they really are?  With covid-19, it's about how evil these sobs are. When you're willing to not give a shit about other people's lives and talk about sacrificing lives for the economy, that's just pure overt evil. I have always seen this potential in the GOP but to witness it played out on the grand stage is nothing short of remarkable.  I just know that they don't have any reasonable card carrying Republicans left. Anyone that still follows them to this point will never accept the truth or facts provided to them by Jesus himself. These are just zombies keeping the ship afloat while it's taking in water.
[comment]Covid-19 just reveals what’s been revealed time and again with Republicans not standing up to the Liar in Chief, not governing for the people, passing bills that benefit the wealthy, gerrymandering districts, suppressing voter turnout and turning a blind eye to the Mueller report, criminal indictments and impeachment. Their history is long. People are beginning to experience fatigue. Republicans were in such bad shape, they were the party Trump could attach to like a parasite.
[comment]The democrats should also be grouped into this
[comment]Especially Rush Limbaugh. His show became exclusively blame the left all day. 
I have listened to it for many years out of interest in the Republican arguments. It was fun to try and deconstruct his craziness and see how he attempted to influence his listeners in roundabout ways.
But now it's straight "the left is evil and wants to destroy America" all day, mixed with ads for diets or mattresses. No subtlety to it. 
Then I switch to NPR where they use facts and real people's stories...
[comment]Just read about Germans before World War Two. Republicanism is the same. A garbage culture fueled by ignorance and hatred.
[comment]Democrats too, not offering any real alternative to status quo.  That's why I'm going communist.  Not like my life was better under Obama.  I had to pay $2500 to an insurance company for shit insurance that was too expensive to actually use.  The wars didn't end, Bush wasn't prosecuted, Guantanimo Bay wasn't closed, police brutality against blacks only increased.
[comment]If the pandemic is the thing that finally is making you see that...fuck you...they have been heartless demons for years now...not that the dems do anything to really stop them though...
[comment]It's also exposed how weak and feckless most democratic leadership is as well. Fuck the republicans but damned if pelossi and shcumer arent more useless than tits on a fish.
[comment]Cancerous traitorous monsters
[comment]Nah it’s just confirmed that people priorities are whipping there ass and having a fashionable face mask I mean if you look at that way you shouldn’t have any political say lol if ya think about it we all live in the same place and should have similar goals and yet we have two parties with conflicting goals which leads one to ask why? Personally I think they in it together and use the media to divide people to obtain their personal goals so In away your halfway right but instead of keeping a better eye on one side how bout keeping full attention on the whole fuck show
[comment]I am 36. 

For me it was the Iraq War. For people before that it was Reagan. Bush 1 was, for Republicans, probably the last good one.
[comment]About 10% more than I felt I knew. But I think it's more public now
[comment]Trump is vowing to destroy Obamacare in a pandemic; we gave the most extensive distribution of wealth in history to billionaires, expanded executive power, etc. Wealth inequality has been increasing for a long time now, while Biden is far better than Trump, he will still increase wealth inequality. I don't like voting to be a serf, but I feel I don't have a choice.
[comment]I live in Salt Lake city, a democratic area for sure. But I work in southern Utah, and without knowing for sure I would imagine 80-90% of the people I work with are strong republicans. (one guy has a leftist tears mug lol). I really really try not to take a generic view of "republican bad, Democrat good". But God damn if talking to them about current events doesn't just push me further into my beliefs. In team zoom calls we have guys saying it's unconstitutional and the company has to let them into the office, etc. Defending the gov blindly. Just the blatant lack of care for anybody other than yourself astounds me. 

It's almost as if being a selfish bastard is a requirement for the republican party these days.
[comment]It's almost like Mother Nature said 'you didnt get it with Irma, huh?'
[comment]Let's not forget the Dems too. Utter disappointment across the board. We need a new party that truly represents the working class.
[comment]Confirmed it for sure. Pure evil. One of my Pokémon friends left our 3 year group chat because we were complaining about the Rs
[comment]The huge number of Republican conservatives who don't believe the virus is real or that it's made by the government blows my mind. I have friends who call it the "plandemic."
[comment]Omg have you seen all their plandemic posts lately
[comment]You must be new here
[comment]Here's an idea. How about stop being so hateful just because people have different political views than you. This world will be better if people looked past these differences instead of this tribal partisan crap
[comment]Not really. It's always been pretty obvious to me.
[comment]I did Nazi this coming.

Seriously though, I don't see a world any time soon where unity is possible. We've tried to meet them in the middle many times over the years, but it's always involved throwing a vulnerable group under the bus, or being stabbed in the back by Republicans. Most of them WANT to hurt people. It makes them feel good, and they'll lie to your face to accomplish that. 

Unfortunately, there are a lot of centerists who will keep trying to stradle that line out of principle, or believing they're above partisan politics. And to be fair, a lot of us have Republican friends, neighbors, and family. It's difficult to accept that someone who you care about can be such a cruel human being.
[comment]I’m republican and even I question my own party. We’re protesting against science and bowing to a man who hasn’t helped, even a little... some members of my family even think this was a man made disease. I might be changing parties until Covid-19 blows over.
[comment]Not since Covid, since they all got behind Trump during the election. However, since this virus began I'm more disgusted than ever and ashamed that I was ever a part of the Republican party. Most of my friends are Republicans and some family members and they are all completely brainwashed.
[comment]Largely, although it’s important to point out that not all Republicans are scumbags or even necessarily Trump supporters. I know a few Republicans who are fairly moderate and might even vote D on some issues. 

I still think there has to be room for dissent from mainstream thought (which I believe leans more from moderate left to far left) but yeah, there seems to be a disproportionate number of scumbags within the ranks of the R party.
[comment]It highligts there low inteligece in extrem stiuations like this,
[comment]Democrats have been screaming hysterically for 3 years about nonsensical Russian conspiracy theories, have done nothing but waste time and money on fruitless investigations, and have been trying to sabotage the President's Covid response and you guys still support them?

You guys need to have your heads examined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]New Rule: Just because Fox News is obsessed with the Biden sex assault allegations, it doesn't mean the rest of us have to be.
[selftext]https://youtu.be/Ju1ZFuvjzYc[comment]#AMEN!
[comment]If only they covered the 25+ Trump accusations. It's a little less credible you are innocent when a dozen women accusing you isn't even half of the total number.
[comment]Well this was eye opening... 👁👁
[comment]I'd broaden that: just because cable TV news fixates on certain stories (those differ between networks) doesn't mean anyone else needs to fixate on them.

I recall a few years ago when Lawrence O'Donnell had Michael Avenati on his show almost daily.

What sells the most ads may not be what provides the best information for the citizenry.
[comment]And once again....right wingers and Bernie Bro’s team up. And no one can extrapolate this unholy alliance to the notion that Russian and the Trump administration is in cahoots to keep this shit relevant?

I sincerely find it amusing that the Limbaugh crowd constantly talks about right wingers having this almost supernatural ability for “Critical thinking”, but only as it applies to the “other party”.

I find it equally amusing that the “Feel the Bern” people are so “woke”...but cannot admit to it that they are being played.

The sad thing about the Bernie people? Is that they fell for it in 2016....they were so CONVINCED that Clinton had a sex trafficking ring in the basement of a pizza shop. You would think that they’d be “woke” enough to not fall for the same bullshit twice.

But....like the hard right? They are more married to their ideology than reality and finding the truth.
[comment]All aspects of these allegations from Reade are very suspicious not the least of which is "Why now when he is the presumptive nominee?"
[comment]Fuck this.....we should be obsessed
[comment]Alternatively we could hold our politicians accountable. Yeah fox should have given legitimate coverage to trumps numerous accusers. That doesn’t mean we just sweep inconvenient things under the rug because our political opponents have no dignity.
[comment]Let’s put trump’s accusations on the board, along with grab them by the pussy and he has been accused of raping an underage girl. 

Oh wait! His supporters don’t give a shit.
[comment]Man we can do better than this take.  This is cheesy af and we deserve to get blasted by the right for flipping so hard on women's issues.
[comment]They know he's a threat to defeat Trump, so clearly this is a scheme to lower his votes. Lmao, we all know this, hopefully it doesn't work that well though.
[comment]Trump has already shown he is willing to cheat and break the law and fabricate non-stories to smear Biden. Why should we believe anything they ~~make~~ dig up on him?
[comment]Omg all of you fuckers are saying the exact same thing trump's supporters are saying about his accusers.
[comment]The goal of the Bernie Bros is to destroy Joe Biden. The goal of Fox is to attack the rest of the media and scream "double standard!" over and over again.

The Democrats had better wake up. The Republicans plan on campaigning on Alternate Reality where the Mueller Report exonerated Trump, the impeachment was a partisan witch hunt, and Trump is blameless when it comes to the Governor's Little Problem.
[comment]Maybe the dems should not have a picked a vulnerable candidate again.
[comment]Is that Putin love letter real?
[comment]as a democrat we should 100% take this just as seriously as the allegations against trump. You can't just pick and choose like this
[comment]OR... we could prove ourselves to NOT be hypocrites and hold Biden just as accountable as we did Trump.
[comment]The hypocrisy of the Democrats has turned me so far away from the party. It's so disappointing. The Democratic party has as much integrity as rock. 

You should all be ashamed.
[comment]Oh my god this is so embarrassing. It’s the exact reason why young people aren’t gonna turn out for Biden b/c we’ve come to understand how hypocritical and stand-for-nothing Democrats are
[comment]I agree that there should be more focus on Trump's scandals too, he always gets away with whatever he is accusing other's of, but I am pretty horrified to see so many dems just throwing the #metoo movement in the garbage, just because it is currently politically inconvenient. Also, I have given Bill Maher too many second chances after saying some awful bigoted shit. I'm over his unfunny, racist show, but that's just me
[comment]Meanwhile during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings...
[comment]Glad that Bill said this, because no one else would have.
[comment]One case is one case too many. Why vote in a rapist when you have Bernie
[comment]“Believe all women until it’s not profitable” you guys are disgusting, how dare you
[comment]Why would we ignore these allegations?
[comment]I think we should vote on who Obama, the DNC ghouls, Gulf state oligarchs, health insurance billionaires, and pay day loan company CEOs should pick for our nominee.
[comment]I bet he wished he had been more critical of the Russiagate stuff considering the new findings about the lack of evidence for "Russian meddling."
[comment]President pussygrabber is so far ahead of Biden in accusations...they should be  concerned the media will start comparing their appetites for grabbing lady parts...Biden was better and vice president for eight years...it didn't seem to bother him then....non issue
[comment]Bill Maher is a boring libertarian. Pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Reporter asks Trump: "If a POTUS loses more Americans over six weeks than died in the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?"
[selftext]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siK0Xm0TqDY[comment]Well considering he did virtually nothing til mid March when Americans were already being infected the answer is no
[comment]Holy FUCK finally a reporter calls his incompetence out to his face.
[comment]An embarrassment to this country. Total idiot
[comment]I clapped when I heard this question. Wasn't there, but still well-deserved.
[comment]Just for perspective, there 58,316 American casualties in the Vietnam War. The number of US COVID deaths are now at 55,000.

Just 3,316 more to go before another "Trump Win."
[comment]yeah that 60-70 number is not happening now

why couldn't he just have lied and said 100 or 120 at least, the second wave kills as much as the first, but there's no way we keep it under 70 now
[comment]Whew
[comment]Grading on a trump scale this was a coherent answer
[comment]Wow. He essentially said: “at least I’m not responsible for 2.2 million deaths”
[comment]What ? Damn, I missed that due to the mute button problem....well done.
[comment]I mean listen I’m no trump supporter but what kind of question is that? I understand the incompetence of trump, especially in a dire situation where this country and the world needs a leader, but all the blame can’t be shifted on trump in all honesty. State governments are equally to blame, especially those anti-lockdown protesters. Trump shut down the country like any other country should, however the virus was well already spreading throughout the nation, state governors idk for what reason didn’t shut down their state borders, issues strict enforcement on mask wearing, curfews, etc...heck even in my state of Connecticut(one of the most infected states out there), people here still continue to go out to the stores without masks or gloves, there’s no strict curfew, law enforcement isn’t doing anything to enforce such regulation(not their fault considering they only have to follow orders and if no orders are given what else can they do?), etc... Again I’m not trump supporter and I certainly won’t be voting for him in the next election, but in regard to the outbreak of the virus, there wasn’t much else he could’ve done. He shut down the country when the number of infected were still very low, yet states at the time didn’t issue any type of strict enforcements to limit the spread (like closing off state borders), and now look at the situation wer in now. And now there’s even state governors like that in Texas who are calling to end the lockdown and these anti-lockdown protestors don’t even care whether they get the virus much less anyone else. I’m very much aware of Trump’s incompetence in general and his tone/speeches aren’t saving face either, but overall in reality there wasn’t much he else he could’ve done and I also blame state government for not doing much in the initial outbreak stages either to limit the spread.
[comment]Fun fact, "only" about 25,000 Americans died in battle in the 8 years of the revolutionary war.
[comment]Lame....
[comment]Jesus that’s a bold question.
[comment]It feels like he’s been coached since the shit show last week. 

Not that it helped.
[comment]40 countries have done more testing per capita than the US.
[comment]He takes no responsibility.
[comment]Nobody wants to talk about ventilators because 1) the situation evolves 2) tragically they are largely ineffective in improving outcomes

Hey as long as you’re a super genius why not invent a time machine and stop yourself from firing the pandemic task force.
[comment]Wait, was the original estimate of 2 million before or after it was one case, soon to go to zero?
[comment]This question is unfair. How would Trump know? He dodged Vietnam.
[comment]That reporter is awesome.
[comment]I mean, we can all agree he did not succeed in answering the question, but he handled it a lot better than I thought he would. Given his recent history with reporters asking the tough questions.
[comment]I'm actually genuinely surprised that he didn't resort to name-calling the reporter like he normally does...
[comment]What a shockingly dumb and arrogant question. You can certainly ask tough questions about this, but by that dumb and brute comparison no leader in the world should be re-elected.
[comment]Classic dodge the question
[comment]The greatest con artist of all time is getting better and better...
[comment]What a delusional fuck he is
[comment]The CDC issued its first warning on Jan 8. 

Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9, Jan 14, Jan 28, Jan 30, Feb 10, Feb 19, Feb 20, Feb 21 &amp; Feb 28. 

He golfed on Jan 18, Jan 19, Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 7 &amp; Mar 8. 

The first time he admitted the coronavirus might be a problem was Mar 13.
[comment]I’m very surprised he didn’t call the person out for asking such a “nasty” question 🙄🙄
[comment]No!
[comment]I’m convinced he was wearing an earpiece &amp; getting correction anytime he veered off-course. If you watched the whole presser, he started to bullshit and do accordion hands and would suddenly stop. Same with this. I think someone told him to end after that question as it was going to go downhill.
[comment]WW1 had 53k combat deaths, 63k deaths of soldiers from disease.

675k died from the spanish flu.

Trump is not a good president nor does he seem like good person but the comparison between Vietnam combat deaths amd this pandemic is invalid.  It's not even apples and oranges comparison, it's a comparison between apples and plexiglass.
[comment]Even if Trump had tried to do anything, isn't he the guy who tweeted that the President is always responsible for everything that happens in his watch?
[comment]This outbreak is his personal Vietnam.
[comment]I think a lot of us owe her a beer, technically. I mean she was waaay more eloquent than I was imagining someone to be when they finally used his own words against him... but nonetheless that was a technical shit talk.
[comment]The COVID-19 deaths were not president Trump's fault. It's not his fault that there is a new, highly infectious, deadly disease going around, and the US fatality rate due to COVID-19 is actually lower than most countries. In the US, there are 320 million people yet only 56,521 COVID-19 deaths, while in Spain, Italy, and Germany combined, there are 190 million people and 56,624 COVID-19 deaths. Also, the average amount of deaths in the US in 6 weeks is a little under 325,000. The US leads the world in COVID-19 tests and in vaccine/treatment research; the US has also created many innovative methods for the safety of doctors such as machines to clean masks so that they can be reused. Also, this entire pandemic was China's fault because if they had not lied and covered it up and acted upon COVID-19 just 3 weeks sooner than they did, even though they new about for 2 months prior, they would have been able to prevent 95% of all of the COVID-19 cases and prevent the pandemic all together. The Chinese government and WHO also lied about saying that COVID-19 was not spread by human to human contact even though Taiwan said otherwise and had facts to back it up in mid January. Trump 2020.
[comment]I mean... is that really fair? This virus was going to hit no matter what and, by all accounts, we have mitigated the disaster by social distancing. Since the real power to handle this crisis is in the states hands,  I think a much fairer evaluation of the president's job in all this is to look at federal actions supporting the states and what the president has set in expectations and what he has actually done. I think we can all agree that he is fucked at this point from any rational evaluation of this.

But considering we are still below that very optimistic estimates of deaths, I'd say the nation is doing as well as it could have at this point in so far as government and populace reactions to the crisis. Except libertarians. Fuck libertarians.
[comment]The great [Olivia Nuzzi](https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi), currently at New York Magazine, is the reporter asking the question.
[comment]I'm actually shocked that he didn't just yell at her for being "an awful reporter, fake news, deep state," and so on.  

This was one of the most coherent answers he's ever given, and it was still complete shit.
[comment]I'm not even American and feeling angry, that such a crook could get elected.
[comment]yeah but, no but, yeah but, no but..
[comment]How can he argue they are doing well through this when countries who acted properly have far less fatalities per capita?
[comment]Trump claimed STD's were His Vietnam.  His boys are among the least intelligent humans on earth and they have immense influence. Our military claims something but they don't remember.  Where did six trillion go...
Thank you for your service white supremacy.
[comment]No, this piece of shit needs to be voted out and LOCK HIM UP for his CORRUPTION and being a traitor for RUSSIA!!!
[comment]He didn't answer the question and he congratulated himself.
[comment]Such a liar
[comment]well he didn't answer the question and all he did was congratulate himself, but I expected something along the lines of "such a nasty question. you are fake news. NEXT!!!" so it was a pleasant surprise nevertheless.
[comment]No one said 2.2 million people would die.  He is using the old word salad to lessen the blow, and people always fucking fall for it!   

"Hey mom and dad, I need to tell you something... I have brain cancer.  JUST KIDDING! I'm pregnant!".
[comment]If he had done what they did in California we would have 1/3 the cases and 1/5 the deaths.

And he knew and could have acted long before leadership in California did.
[comment]Absolutely not!  Vote Blue!
[comment]&gt;"So, yea, we've lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million. We're probably heading to sixty thousand, seventy thousand." 

That's not going to age well.
[comment]He's actively increasing the number of deaths. It's like him co-operating with the virus itself (or competing with it)...
[comment]"I think... I think... I think..." What you think doesn't fucking matter. Face the facts!
[comment]Humm was the 40k Americans allowed to return from China put into quarantine or
We’re they just allowed in so they could spread the virus ?
[comment]The problem is that he answers with such an avalanche of complete lies, about the border, about ventilators, about testing, that the only possible response is “that’s a lie” — but where do you get in? He’s already said 10 lies and somebody calls him on the last one? Somebody needs to yell out, in the middle of his response, “that’s complete bullshit!”
[comment]Trump should never have allowed anyone to return to the country from anywhere when this thing hit. We wouldn't be where we are at right now, if he was a better leader. The Democrats, however, did no better at the beginning and instead politicized a crisis as much as Trump.
[comment]Oh man, trump didn't answer the question?!?! No. Way.
[comment]All the points about Trump's overall awfulness are true. He's a dangerous monster. That said, the logical argument implied by the question - that the President in office should not be re-elected if more people die from a single cause during his term than died during the Vietnam War - doesn't make sense. If it did, then every President who failed to take a stand against the sale of cigarettes, alcohol, or failed to make flu vaccines mandatory is equally culpable and unworthy of re-election. Oh, but who wants to live in a Nanny state? The CDC reports "Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure. " And yet cigarettes are sold at every corner store and grocery store in the country. There is no difference morally in claiming a "freedom"'exemption to justify those deaths than in the people who want to go to work or get a haircut.
[comment]And all the while Trump defenders will still eat up his shit.
[comment]He never answered her question...
[comment]The fact that he was elected in the first place still boggles the mind. I really did not think there were *that* many stupid Americans.
[comment]It's a truly, fundamentally, monumentally stupid "gotchya" question and plays right into Trump's mentality. It's almost like she's just another "plant" (like that one recently...), but in this case planted by Trump himself to do a "bad gotchya question". I'm sickened by this kind of approach. It only feeds Trump's fervor, precisely because even in his dim intelligence he can discern that it is a very, very badly formed question. That's exactly the kind of question that won't work. It is, one could even say, the very reason we have Trump in power in the first place. If Trump enrages me, this reporter's question makes me throw up in my mouth.

Whether x number of people die has nothing to do with any comparison to a high mortality event (such as a war); it has to do with the intrinsic nature of the death dealing event in conjunction with the competence of response. To put it in the general terms she uses about "a POTUS", meaning that any president will be a failure if they lose a lot of people, no matter the event, especially if the death count is more than a great and infamous war, regardless of why those people died, is a guaranteed way to take that little shot she has and throw it away. If the San Andreas fault went and killed a million people, would we say, "well any president in charge when the US lost a *million people* in one day is a failure if it is more than the number of Americans killed in WWII, clearly". This has to do with the nature of the mortal event. In a way, it's the same as saying "I'm shocked -- SHOCKED -- that X". Which doesn't say shit.

Now, if she were to have focused very specifically on the incompetence of February, the inability to do the math in a timely manner, to initiate strong containment measures, etc., she might have had a chance at putting a dent in his armor. But the way she asked this, she galvanized his armor.  Thanks but no thanks. We need to do better.
[comment]Lapping the world?  WTF is he even talking about?  The world which had respect for us now has nothing but pity and contempt.  

This guy sucks.
[comment]In the same six weeks, there are normally 320,000 deaths. Is Trump responsible for those too? The virus represents about a 15% increase in daily deaths, almost half of it in NYC metro.

The US ranks near the bottom of western countries in per capita infections and per capita deaths  Without NYC metro, the US would be last.

The reporter is either a total idiot or a Democrat operative hired to smear Trump with lurid nonsense..
[comment]I'm surprised that Trump can answer this in his normal voice and not being angry and call reporters 'fake news'. :D
[comment]As a person who despises this administration and Trump, I hate this reporter's question. Aid hasn't been delivered to native Americans nor Puerto Rico, and she uses her chance to ask an actual question to make a viral video. And this is exactly the kind of thing that reinforces Trump sycophant's perspective on the main stream media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Reminder: Russian trolls are active on reddit to create division between Biden and Bernie, like 2016.
[selftext]https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-detailed-2016[comment]I know some Bernie Bro’s who are not Russian Trolls but they are actively trying their best to destroy Biden. They’re doing the same thing they did four years ago where they are advocating writing Bernie on to their ballots.

They do more harm than the Russian trolls in my opinion.
[comment]I don’t know if it’s Russian trolls or Bernie Bros, but I get three to four PMs a week from strange users trying to demonize Biden.
[comment]Sandersforpresident has been extra toxic lately.
[comment]It's not just Russia btw. There are covert conservative funded propaganda campaigns as well.
[comment]jesus tapdancing christ on a pogo stick can we give this russia shit a rest

 [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/russia-sanders-campaign-taibbi-957377/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/russia-sanders-campaign-taibbi-957377/) 

&gt; Did the Russians actually do these things? Maybe. It’s not confirmed either way. The sourcing even today remains tied to the same people who’ve lied about a thousand other things, both in the course of this story and before, from WMDs to the missile gap. As we saw this week, when officials quietly began admitting their ideas about “what Russia wants” rested upon perhaps “[**overstated**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/politics/intelligence-briefer-russian-interference-trump-sanders/index.html)” interpretations of intelligence, many of these narratives have been elaborate exercises in reading tea leaves. And they won’t let us see the tea leaves.   
&gt;  
&gt; The United States, whose spending on intelligence and the military alone nearly equals Russia’s GDP, could crush Russia for breakfast and take the rest of the day off for beer and volleyball. But officials have spent the past few years furiously constructing a popular vision of the Russian enemy far bigger than the actual country, which the likes of Rachel Maddow and Barack Obama not long ago were correctly calling a “[**gnat on the butt of an elephant**](https://twitter.com/maddowblog/status/449242948941934592?lang=en).”   
&gt;  
&gt; The logic of Russiagate is now beyond absurd. Vladimir Putin, somehow in perfect sync with American voting trends, seeks to elevate both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, apparently to compete against himself in the general election, in a desperate effort to suppress the terrifying political might of, say, Joe Biden. I doubt even Neera Tanden in the depths of a wine coma could believe this plot now   
&gt;  
&gt; That this is a dumb story is characteristic. The people pushing it don’t have any smart arguments left for remaining in power. Through decades of corporate giveaways, trickle-up economics, pointless wars, and authoritarianism, they’ve failed the entire population. They are the ones directly threatened by any hint that the population is awakening to its decades-long disenfranchisement.
[comment]Ummm...yea, Russian troll are not the problem.
[comment]The Bernie subreddits are really full of Russians right now.
[comment]I wouldn’t be surprised, and I also don’t know what would be worse - people taking the bait of Russian trolls or just becoming trolls themselves “organically.”
[comment]While this is clearly what we expected from the start, I feel like we have to be cognizant of what we do and don't consider to be Russian or conservative troll operations. It can be very obvious sometimes, and less obvious other times, but you have to take every comment and post with a modicum of sensibility. I've seen people be called Russian trolls or operatives for simply speaking out and being concerned about certain things. It should be okay to have a healthy discussion on some issues we have with candidates, but still be aware that there are many trolls out there feeding into it. Others in this post are claiming Bernie bros are worse than Russian trolls, and that kind of comparison is a concerning one. I want to support Biden, and I want to have Trump out of office, but if some criticism is dismissed as Russian trolling, or somehow considered worse, it's hard to feel welcome.
[comment]I would not be surprised if they are on reddit, but this article doesn't mention that. Is there another that does?

I remember seeing loads of imgur posts that were lying about what was in wikileaks dumps (e.g. attributing quotes by Ben Carson to Democrats) and thought in retrospect they could be Russian, but it's also possible they were done by hard-right or hard-left people.
[comment]Also the Chinese. Also the Republicans
[comment]reminder: joe biden's a shit candidate, and pretending people with valid concerns are russian bots is what the hillary people did in 2016
[comment]Perhaps it's also best to keep in mind that just because someone criticizes your candidate or their platform does not inherently mean it's some undercover conspiracy. It surely is happening, but it is too easily to claim with no basis or evidence that "blah blah blah is just trying to reelect trump because they don't like my candidate." 

Political discussion is seldom pretty, so to assume every attack against who or what you believe in to be a bad faith arguement is ignorant at best and trumpism-esque delusional at worst. Do your homework if you see something you don't like. If you blindly throw accusations along partisan lines and refuse to consider the humans who support what you oppose and why they say what they say, you may as well be a Russian bot because you are hurting democracy just as badly.
[comment]Yes, because everyone that that doesn't like Biden must be Russian.
[comment]I noticed it big time the last five days.  I informed the moderators of r/feminism they were being brigaded by trolls going after Biden with a common theme and they were so thankful for my input that they banned me.

Also, r/politics has been completely taken over by foreign trolls who egg on Bernie Sanders supporters with stories that are outright false about Biden.  The same exact shit as 2016.

I implore you if you are a Bernie supporter, tread carefully on who you believe and repost on social media.  Because 90% of the stuff I have seen on the far left subreddits the last five days has been textbook Russian or Russian-style shit prop from the outside.
[comment]This election won't be lost or won because of Russian trolls, and thinking that is another type of scapegoat from real criticisms of Biden or Bernie. 

You have to lean forward into this stuff, not sit back and scream 'Russian!' when up against uncomfortable information.
[comment]Biden and his record has done a fine job of convincing me never to vote for him. And I've voted Dem my entire 20-year voting history.

I bit my tongue and voted Hillary in 2016, but not this time. 

Biden is showing no leadership right now, while Bernie literally fought to save a couple million of low income Americans the other night.

It is clear who the next president should be, and I refuse to settle for less than Bernie.

So you can either lose with Biden or win with Bernie. It's your choice.
[comment]Itstead of just being the town crier let’s get some posts with what our counter measures are to be. Please.
[comment]What's really shitty about this is we have to have rely on the Mueller report for information about this. That was released a year ago and against the objections of the president. We should have the FBI releasing regular reports on these misinformation campaigns. We need a president who will take our national security seriously.
[comment]👋🇷🇺: WILL TR0LL F0R F00D
[comment]Biden kinda sucks though.
[comment]You know I just thought of one thing. If we have to go to vote by mail for the November election it might actually stop the Russians from hacking the voting machines and handing Trump another election. The counting machines likely won't have anything to do with the vulnerable electronic machines.
[comment]I'm a Virginian and i do not like anything about joe biden
[comment]I am not a troll, not a Russian, nor a bot. I have issues with Biden and my vote for him is not guaranteed. The division is real.
[comment]I dont see very many Biden fans.  So arguments that way are rare.
[comment]Look. I’ll vote for Biden if I have to buy I don’t want to.
[comment]Does everything have to be russia?  

My dad died because he could not afford healthcare.  One of the candidates said he would veto medicare for all if the democrats passed it.  People are allowed to have opinions on candidates if they want.  If there's paying jobs where all you have to do is troll reddit all day, please send me an application.  I need to pay rent and eat and as of this month I'm unemployed.
[comment]Of course, they are!! Fk Putin! Isn’t there a window with his name on it?
[comment]So I support Bernie and all I hear from you guys: Bernie Bros this and Bernie Bros that, Russian trolls etc..  its sickening and also weird how you just cant accept that someone you will need in general election can have a more progressive views that yours.  Not paid by Russia but just likes healthcare and education more than you I guess.  Be nice to Bernie supporters we will vote for you in the end.... unless your'e going to be bunch of asses of course
[comment]I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it happening already. Damn.
[comment]Bernie supporter here...nothing pisses me off more than how aggressive Biden supporters have been on this subreddit. Just when I think eh whatever i'll vote Biden I see this shit and the comments and think how much do you have to blame other countries to hide their same old status-quo agenda's? You want the Bernie voters to come you will need to get your heads out of Biden's ass and push him to compromise with progressives more. FACT.    

SideNote: Remember Bernie supporters are mostly 30 and younger we know the difference between fake news unlike Biden supporters...
[comment]You should repost this every day from now until the election to remind us.
[comment]That may well be. But with news about Biden sexually assaulting his staff person...if I have to choose between Trump and Biden I'll stay home. There may be people who are causing issues on purpose, but Biden is proving to be the main cause for me.
[comment]The real problem is that it makes you question authentic sentiment. 

There are plenty of people who like Bernie and don’t like Biden, and who are tired of the “well would you vote for the other guy?” question. (I’d love to hear Biden and his supporters answer the same)

But at the same time if I say something critical of Bernie (and yes, I do believe in constructive criticism, and calling out bullshit) then I get pounced on. The speed and ferocity of the negativeness can’t be organic.

I definitely think that some of the subs are at least partially moderated by the IRA. If Russia can penetrate the CIA, I’m sure they can get moderation on these subs.
[comment]Why care Trump crime family has destroyed our country and our military is backing it. Our military are Treasonous fucking assholes.  Think about that.
[comment]r/PresidentialRaceMemes was one of my favorite subs, but now it’s been taken over by toxic Bernie or Bust folks. There’s even a poll on the front page where people are encouraging voting Green/Third Party. The change was so rapid and so dramatic that I refuse to believe it’s not coordinated. I’m a progressive and a Bernie guy, so it’s been especially frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Until my dying day I will never understand why Hillary Clinton’s existence causes so many people’s brains to melt into pudding. It’s just baffling on every level and anytime anyone tries to explain why they hate her so much they sound like raving fucking lunatics.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/SJGrunewald/status/1203503669699678208?s=09[comment]There have been few, if any, politicians in the United States in modern history who have so consistently been the subject of such intensely negative media attention, commentary, and opinion editorial pieces... for as long as she has. She doesn’t get a pass for some of her Warhawk positions but yeah her negative name identification is the result of that sustained negative media attention for 30 years
[comment]Brain washing and propaganda about her for 20 plus years.
[comment]Agreed.
[comment]Fox news spent 30 years piling up lies and hate. 

It takes a special kind of person to listen to 30 year so that and not turn off. 

The kind of person that needs an enemy. The kind of person that needs to hate.
[comment]A highly successful GOP psyop started in 1990.
[comment]In 2016 I was all aboard the Bernie train. During the primaries I ingested all the anti-Hillary flak. A lot of it was petty stuff and of course there was the obvious BS like Benghazi and her emails, but after hearing so very much of this sort of shit I began to believe "well, I'm sure a lot of this is BS but *some* of it must be true." It soured me on her so badly that I thought I might vote for Rubio or Jeb over her if she got the nomination, despite the fact I've never voted R in my whole life.

Disclaimer: When it came down to her vs Trump I sprinted to my polling place to vote for her over him. I'm not a moron.
[comment]Clearly these people just needed a tiny push, after which it was all their own energy perpetuating it. You have to give credit to the people who understood how to get the ball rolling, they were very efficient and the machine they set in motion is still running itself. Very close to perpetual motion.
[comment]Misogyny. Contempt for women is a National past time.
[comment]Really though they voted for and continue to support Trump.
[comment]It started with her work on Watergate.  Then, decades of hate, lies, and utter bullshit.
[comment]Her support of Bill’s ‘tough on crime’ stance is just one of many examples that she was rightly criticised by the left for co-opting populist reputation policies. It’s hard to argue that she wasn’t just a shell without principles that would say or do whatever it took to get elected.
[comment]Hey, remember that "Here's how Bernie can still win!" dude that wrote dozens upon dozens of articles in 2016 about how Sanders is totally going to win the election (even though he wasn't even a candidate anymore at the time)?

He's a 2020 Trump supporter now and writes articles about how Sanders supporters should switch to Trump.

Imagine that.
[comment]I like her well enough as a human being. But her voice could sometimes be a bit unpleasant.
[comment]I remember back in the '16 cycle someone had a tweet simmering to the effect of "if you have an issue with voting for Hillary over Trump, call your mom right now and work that shit out." I'm convinced that's behind most of it.
[comment]She’s got a better kdr then me for one
[comment]I used to just chalk it to straight misogyny, but season 2 of Slow Burn helped explain how long the Clintons have endured smear. There were lots of voters letting inaccurate headlines and Leno jokes from 20 years ago cloud their judgments
[comment]Because Dems don't think for themselves, are feeble, and fold to the whims of Republican talking points.
[comment]Bernie will win. He doesnt have an expiration date. 

This country is a goddamn nightmare, you dont get to pretend like everything is fine anymore.
[comment]Maybe you should learn something from Hillary's complete inability to inspire change. 

Like if I'm being honest I think the democratic party really hates having complete power because that means they have to deliver to their voters while pretending to protect capital and the rich assholes who own the party. 

America NEVER had a labor party. We NEVER had a voice for working people. We have a half assed corporate monstrosity that sells us a dream and then hands it to the republicans every fucking 8 years. And yes that includes Obama.

I hate this whole system i want it completely burnt to the ground.
[comment]It all begins with the Nytimes and William Fucking Safire.
[comment]It's critical that we are able to understand, tap into, and counter the sentiments that led people to hate her. IMHO, it was that she made people feel stupid. Gore had some of the same problems
[comment]Social engineering by Russia.
[comment]If she turn back to her 90s self I’ll love her
[comment]Murdoch, ailes, and the gop
[comment]Before she was a major figure, she did lots of good work with and for disabled children. When she first came to national attention, she was authentic and genuine. 

Of course she was attacked by republicans for trying to have a real cause as first lady and not quite looking and acting like a “usual” first lady. She tried to get involved in congress passing Universal healthcare, what a bonkers idea... Shes smart and she learned fast how to play the game and did so all during Bill’s terms in office, molding herself into a generic pantsuit and quaffed fake politician. She parlayed that successful transformation into being elected a senator and eventually secretary of state. 

The problem is, as SoS she helped the Obama regime do plenty of heinous shit in Latin America, just like the US has been doing for a century and a half, and she’s unrepentant about it, and just last week with seemingly no sense of self reflection, said that bernie hurt her in the primary despite her having the whole party machine and some cable news media working on her behalf. She’s become another self absorbed, self serving politician and we’re obviously worse off overall not having her over trump, but there’s plenty of reason to despise the empty suit of a politician she’s become.
[comment]Sometimes a person is untrustworthy *and* there’s a right wing conspiracy to destroy her.
[comment]Have you read up on what happened in Libya? You should.
[comment]She is from the same town and went to the same school. I've asked the s as me question of people who have known her and it's mostly because a) fox news, b) she really is kind of an asshole. Very entitled apparently.
[comment]Buttery males!
[comment]Same reason why they have so much venom for Pelosi and AOC
[comment]I think it’s the fake blonde hair; makes her look dishonest.
[comment]I mean...everytime someone has dirt on the clintons they end up committing suicide with two bullets to the back of your head...it makes you wonder.
[comment]I felt like I decently liked Hillary since she’s a wonky, nerdy, worker bee. And I identified with that. 
But I’ve been disappointed in her behavior post 2016 election.
[comment]I mean I admit I don’t like her politics but I did support her over Donald and the level of hate it goes to for a lot of people is... something else.
[comment]Because the Clinton's are evil, greedy, globalists who use their illegitimate foundation to funnel wealth from tragedy into their own pockets, but they also use it to take advantage of displaced children (Haiti and probably Syria too). The people gushing in this comment section for a woman who is objectively evil...all the while talking about brainwashing/propaganda?...is the irony lost?
[comment]Australia had the same with its Democratic equivalent party, the Labor Party with their leader Bill Shorten. It becomes an MSM led sanction - you're allowed to hate the individual chosen. It is part of a mass response.
[comment]I don't hate her. I hate her neoliberal policies, and I hate the fact that the Democratic Party establishment decided she was going to be the nominee no matter what, even if it meant cheating.
[comment]I think a lot of Democrats (including myself) are a bit salty about the perceived wrong doing in the 2016 primaries re: Bernie. I think the Republicans simply drank the Fox kool-aid. In any case she'd be a better candidate that Trump by miles, and I'd still prefer her to Biden.
[comment]My biggest problem with Hillary running for president was that she is the spouse of a past president. I didn't like Bush jr for the same reason. We should be discouraging such type of relationships and a single family holding such a prominent office for multiple terms. I did vote for her over Trump but ideologically i hated myself for it.
[comment]I wouldn’t say that I hate Hillary, I don’t like her though, especially when in comparison with someone like Bernie. Where Hilary’s political ventures change with the tides, Bernie’s stance has been consistent. 
Hillary understands that the current feminist zeitgeist, and she’s capitalising on the movement for her own success. Her support of the movement is hollow. 
Hilary is not pro women. She has never been. 
In 1975, a twelve year old girl was raped, left with permanent physical abnormalities and comatose for 5 days. 
Hilary Clinton defended her rapist, despite knowing of his guilt. She bullied the victim, with defamatory claims in order to relieve her abuser.
Following this, Hilary laughed about the experience.
[comment]To act like there’s no reason to dislike her is dishonest. 

It is disproportional to Trump though. The right usually shouts Benghazi whenever asked for a reason to hate her, but it’s been investigated time after time and there was no wrong doing by her. 

Having said that, start with the Clinton foundation. It has channeled billions over the years via Saudi governments, super pacs, special interests, you name it. I’ve heard numbers like 10% of it is actual charity.
[comment]I’m a Dem, I really didn’t like her in 2016. I wasn’t gonna vote at all until my roommate told me Trump actually had a chance so I put my name down for Hillary.. pretty worthless anyways since I live in Washington and were always gonna go Blue no matter the candidate (let’s not get into the electoral system, which is also dumb, this isn’t a true democracy since popular vote doesn’t actually matter). Long story short, I didn’t like her. And for 2020 I got a bad feeling... these Dem noms are not great. Biden is old, showing signs of the stress already and were not even close, Warren.. just lmao I’m sorry she’s not gonna get it against Trump even if she does deserve it, Sanders I think is a bit too radical for many (although I would probably support his policies against all others). I think Bloomberg is the best choice but honestly I don’t like his odds against an incumbent like Trump. We need a new Barrack who gets the party excited but also doesn’t tip the scales in too radical of a direction like Bernie imo. Trump shouldn’t be this hard to defeat, but at this point I do not think we beat him in 2020 with these candidates.
[comment]Faux News
[comment]She encompasses everything that is wrong with this neoliberal ideology. She sees foreign policy as a chess board where everything is about countering Russia. Never on the side of anti-intervention or stopping regime change wars. Still blames her loss on Russian intervention instead of her not campaigning in the rust belt. Stole the election for Bernie 

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

She was the definition of an establishment candidate. And people are sick and tired of the status quo

This is the same shit as everyone freaking out because Kamala Harris dropped out. Blaming it on racism and sexism rather than her being a terrible candidate. She did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for financial crimes because he was a big democratic donor.

These people are just tools to power and only care about their donors, not their constituents
[comment]She did try to subvert the democratic process by conspiring with the DNC to screw over Bernie. She IS corrupt.
[comment]I like this response the most.

&gt;@oREGINAl49ers

&gt;Women who seek political power are a threat to patriarchy. White women who are aware of their privilege and can effectively articulate it are a threat to white supremacy. Hillary Clinton did both so some people were really upset, afraid, and angry.
[comment]I always assumed it started in Bill’s presidency. She tried to push through a number of things (like health care reform - damn her! /s) and refusing to stay in her lane.
[comment]Okay, I have a story that might help explain this.

(Disclaimer: I am a left-leaning independent voter, and I supported Bernie in 2016.)

I work in the hotel industry, and back in 2016 our hotel had the honor of housing all of the Secret Service details protecting each candidate. It made for an interesting shift each day, as these individual teams would rotate in and out all day and all night.

Most of these folks were all the same: suit and tie, firearm and sunglasses. Groups of around 5-6 leaving in unmarked SUVs (an appalling number of these folks would forget their guns at the breakfast table, and more than once I had to chase them out the door yelling that they forgot their gun.)

The guy in charge of all the teams, as it turns out, was an insomniac, so he would wander downstairs, and eventually he needed someone to talk to. That turned out to be me. This guy, who shall remain nameless, had previously worked for one of those three letter agencies, and had a number of fascinating stories that I won't repeat here. Anyway, I add this for context to explain the next part.

Each time these guys left, they would do so in multiple SUVs, and although they were for the most part dressed identically, they each were in distinctly different moods. Some seemed normal, but one group seemed particularly depressed/annoyed, and the other I noticed seemed like, idk, kind of resigned.

When I asked their boss/agent in charge about then, he looked blank for a moment, then just burst into laughter.

He explained that there were details everyone wanted. (One was Marco Rubio, because he apparently treated his SS agents like old friends. He'd take agents just getting off duty out for lunch sometimes, and he always took their advice seriously, which apparently was very important to them.)

But the two details that no one wanted? If you guessed Hillary and Trump, give yourself a prize.

He told me that at first quite a few were interested in Trump's detail; he made lavish promises on how he would treat them, etc. But that soured quickly, and he began making more and more ridiculous requests of them, such as demanding they wear cowboy dusters and cowboy hats, to send the message that Trump was a 'good ol' boy.'

But it was Clinton's detail that was considered punishment. Some of these guys had heard the horror stories of the Clinton era (their boss wouldn't tell me any of these stories,) and after just a few days at the hotel, it was common to overhear why they didn't want the job now. Hillary puts on a very specific face for the public, but behind the scenes she is a purely hateful person. She treats her detail like lowly servants, ignores their advice whenever possible, and 'curses worse than a sailor' at the slightest inconvenience. The head agent, who was in that three letter agency when Bill was running things, described her as the true power in the marriage, and he had never met anyone since more despicable.

In comparison, he told me, Trump was the job the agents preferred over hers, hands down.

(Just a note: At this early point of the 2016 caucuses, Bernie had not yet accepted a SS detail, but the head agent told me he had met him, and although he didn't agree with Sanders' political aims, he told me Bernie is exactly the guy you see in his commercials, forthright and kind.)

Anyway, I feel that the kind of person that treats the people sworn to die for you so terribly, would probably be doing the world a favor by leaving the limelight forever. Just my two cents.
[comment]Is this a Democrat sub or just a Hilary circle jerk?

Seems like she's the focus here... Let's move on.
[comment]She has a slight overbite.
[comment]She wanted to get in to a nuclear war with Russia over a no-fly zone she wanted in Aleppo, Syria. 

I don't know why anyone would want that.
[comment]One of the Ivy League universities did a study on this... I forget which one. It's misogyny, pure and simple. Everything else is justification. She had a very high approval rating as the Secretary of State (despite the Bengazi BS). Then when she ran for president, it plummeted. The study showed conservatives, who lean toward masculine authoritarianism, despise women attempting to obtain power. It had nothing to do with her personally. It's a sad unveiling of regressive conservatism in the US.
[comment]I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[comment]Plus she’s a murderer so there’s that, and saying no one wants a female President is bull shit. Women make up the majority of voters so how do you explain that? Easily with they are self hating women.
[comment]Republicans have been character assassinating her for some 20 years now.

They were terrified of the Bill Clinton presidency.   One of the most booming economies with wages going up, not just profits for corporations, with record low unemployment  all while cutting the deficit.  The 90s were a golden time in many ways.  

Bill couldn't run again, but they knew Hillary was a very smart girl that had the potential to continue his legacy.  They knew that early on she would eventually have political aspirations,  and smart, powerful women isn't exactly something that the Republican base likes to see.  So they character assassinated her for years and years.  It continues to this day.

They are doing the same with AOC right now.  She's  especially a great target for them because not only is she a woman who won't back down, but she's also Hispanic.  They talk more about AOC than just about any other Democrat these days (outside Pelosi).  They are preparing for when AOC eventually makes a move up the political ranks.

The biggest issue with what they did to Hillary isn't that they endlessly attacked her... it's that the Democratic base abandoned  her by starting to believe at least some of the various attacks they've done on her.
[comment]...and that’s why Donald Trump is president today. Right or wrong (or somewhere in between), it’s real. We can never forget what poor candidate selection cost us; she lost the most winnable election in American history via a combination of powerful unlikability, hubris, and rank mismanagement.

[comment]If Hillary doesn’t want the hate, she should lose gracefully and keep her fucking mouth shut about candidates running now. She has no clue how to run a proper presidential campaign. If she could give good campaign advice or be able to pinpoint Russian agents, she would’ve won the presidency. She’s a sore loser and sad. I don’t really buy into any of the idiotic Fox News conspiracies. I just look at her actual words and pathetic excuses for losing the rust belt. Bernie worked harder than her trying to convince disenfranchised working people that Hillary would have their backs, and obviously, that was not even enough for her to not smear his name and hint at him being a tool for Russians. Hillary is a sad old lady who helped create neoliberalism. Her time and theirs is over.
[comment]Here are two facts; one which Democrats can't accept, and one which Republicans can't accept. 

* Hillary was the target of the conservative brainwashing machine. They hate her because (knowing she was the next primary candidate for the presidency)  the Right spent years demonizing her in a never-ending faux news cycle of hate.
* Hillary would have made a mediocre president. She's too close to corporate money to actually have represented We The People.

An observation:  In a (perhaps sick) philosophical sense, Trump is better, because he forces us to face the damaging consequences of the brainwashing of Fox News/Conservative media, and social media. America now has a call to action that cannot be ignored.
[comment]It's been over 3 years. Time to get over it?
[comment]I don't hate her, but I think she's seriously overhyped.

What I do find deeply disturbing is that the right-wing machine that exists to paint her as the 'antichrist' has mostly succeeded in regards to people who already disliked her.
[comment]At least we know you won't get suicided from 'em
[comment]While I don't hate her (and voted for her), I do find her entitled, out of touch, and robotic.
[comment]It's worth noting that she's hated by the uber left *and* the uber right, but for different reasons. I mean Hell, you had shitbag progressives[voted for Trump in 2016](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds) because they hated HRC so badly.
[comment]Trump would have beaten any Democratic opponent, he was running of eight years of Obama, eight years of pent up national racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Megathread for tonight's Biden/Sanders Democratic Debate
[selftext]**We invite you to discuss tonight's Democratic Debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders beginning at 8:00 EST and 5:00 PST. Please be respectful and stick to the issues.**


--------------


**The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN en Español, CNN International, and Univision, and can be streamed live, without requiring a cable login, on [CNN’s homepage,](https://www.cnn.com/) on mobile devices via CNN’s apps, and on CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast, Android TV, and other set tops.**[comment]Biden just coughed directly into his hand as he answered the coronavirus question. This is off to a stellar start...
[comment]Biden and Bernie really need some sun--both look so pale!!     I hope they attack Trump instead of each other.      Bernie personally comes off as a better "debater" and makes fewer mistakes especially on healthcare.
[comment]Honestly, this is how ALL political debates should be conducted. Primarily 1 on 1 (or small groups) with NO audience. Too often candidates only go for "zingers" to get a crowd response and don't ever actually answer their questions or contribute to the discussion. Or they end up yelling over each other and the audience who cheer and jeer for every little thing that is said. This is really nice, just 1 on 1 discussion over policy.
[comment]Answer the question Bernie. What would you do **now.**
[comment]Biden is taking the “crisis” approach with saying everything in regards to COVID-19 would be free. Bernie is trying to get the point across that his plan for M4A would provide a better foundation or defense, if you will, for such an event.
[comment]Biden is steady like he’s ready to take the role.


All this smearing of his brain power is going to be blown away tonight.
[comment]Bernie keeps talking our healthcare system and how it should be changed in the future. That does not address the crisis. We need to address what to do today.
[comment]It's not Ebola, Bernie!
[comment]I'm finding Biden's behavior really awkward.
[comment]Did Biden just credit himself for stopping a great depression?
[comment]How do we feel about immigrants also getting healthcare?  I would normally say no but seems crucial in times like these
[comment]Bernie doing one of his rants instead of answering Joe's questions about how to pay for it.
[comment]Wait did Joe Biden just straight up lie twice??😬😬😬
[comment]“I still won!”
[comment]I expected this debate to be focused primarily on the coronavirus
[comment]Biden is getting hammered.
[comment]Imagine a Biden-Sanders ticket though.  If Biden were to offer and Bernie were to accept, sure supporters on both sides would be pissed on several fronts.  But once the dust settled, it would ultimately unify the party, end the primary (thus eliminating the threat of spreading coronavirus at the polls), and secure a landslide victory over Trump in November.  Imagine...
[comment]So Bernie has decided to just lie and take everything back to his stump speech, cool.

Leadership sometimes requires working with reality, Bernie. Sticking to your guns is cool for your brand, but doesn't do anything to mitigate damage being done.
[comment]I never thought I would say this, but Voden is making solid points and Bernie is acting like a bumbling idiot and a sore loser. The question about him supporting the winning candidate was an easy one and yet Bernie struggled to answer it!
[comment]Bernie out there blazin Joe up
[comment]Neither one of these clowns have a prayer in hell of beating Trump. with their policies your taxes will be through the roof and gas prices will be $4-5  a gallon.
[comment]Biden has answered every question in a numbered list format
[comment]So they asked Bernie why his message isn’t resonating with African Americans and he talks about turning out young and latino vote?

Given an opportunity to speak directly to us and this marg has NOTHING to say?
[comment]Every time Biden starts with "Number 1" I worry he's going to get lost on his rambling track to the next Number 1" story...
[comment]Where can I find a recorded version of it in Canada? I just happened to have missed it.
[comment]Biden did not try to bring progressives into the fold tonight. He lied about his past record and gave no solutions to what progressives care about. Bernie did not help himself either tonight. He needed to come at Biden way harder than he did. Biden gave one word answers, waited for Bernie to answer and then parroted what Bernie said. The whole Cuba, China bullshit was aggravating just for the fact that it shows that people refuse to think beyond a black and white mentality. It was just fuel for people who respond to dog whistling. 

One last thing. The whole "how will you deal with the Coronavirus?" question is pretty pointless when you CANT do anything now at this moment if you ARE NOT the current president. It was a pointless question and won't be a concern once either candidate gain the office.
[comment][interesting fact checks](https://www.wkyc.com/mobile/article/news/verify/verify-fact-checking-the-11th-democratic-debate/95-394b8c45-40ac-4f66-8c21-d83e3641b177)
[comment]Also very uncool of Biden to talk down on Italy, a nation hit SEVERELY by this pandemic. He used their crisis as a point to down play single payer health care . Think about that. He used actual deaths to LIE  for the sake of his campaign.

South Korea ALSO has a single payer health system. They, along with China’s current system, are being praised as models for how to contain the pandemic.
[comment]Biden is a lying sack of shit. 


Let him go the whole way and I’ll vote trump again.
[comment]1. Number one
2. Number one
3. First thing we got to do
4. Situation Room
5. Those 2 things
[comment]This more a thread about the moderators opinions than actually debating the debate.  Who is this guy?
[comment]Biden has allegedly lost thousands of voters after being caught put lying during debate.

https://youtu.be/nZ2WOT455MA
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter and I realize Biden is going to win.

But God damn is he doing a piss poor job of trying to pivot and unify the party no matter how you think he did at the debate.

Hillary didn't give a damn about trying to unify and it helped tank her.  Biden needs to stop bad mouthing M4A.  Say you don't think it could pass, or that you'd get there in a perfect world, but Everytime he's like "but it doesn't work, we can never do it!" It really makes me not like/ want to vote for him.  Saying he would veto it before the debate was such a terrible political move I was stunned.

This is going to be 2016 all over again till team Biden takes one of the like 10 olive branches Sanders was offering in that softball debate and actually works with the left to unify.  He can't just take it for granted like Clinton did.
[comment]Damn it's pretty crazy how many times Biden lied about easily provable facts about his record.  You guys think he's gonna do anything to reach out to Bernie's support base, or will be just try to win without young people like Hillary did?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]New standards eliminate Tulsi Gabbard from next Democratic debate
[selftext]https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486348-new-standards-eliminate-tulsi-gabbard-from-next-democratic-debate[comment]Good when can we eliminate her from the party?
[comment]She has no business on the debate stage.
[comment]So?
[comment]I admit I didn't read the article, but what polling thresholds and unique contributor numbers has she generated which would give her a place in further debates? As for delegates, she has 2 out of over 1,300 so far. 0.2% to 0.3% should qualify one for debates?
[comment]#DropOutTulsi
[comment]Good. She’s a total and complete disgrace and doesn’t deserve to be on stage.
[comment]You people are insane.  Tulsi v. Trump!?  People would CLEARLY SEE she would be the only presidential-like-adult on stage.
[comment]Didn’t Bernie tweet that she should be allowed to debate? 🤔
[comment]&gt;It’s probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in. 

\-- LBJ

On why, whoever wins the nomination, should invite Tulsi to join their team.

"What position do you want? Uh, okay. Secretary of State is probably off the table, but something else maybe?"

Politics is always about strategy. Get your enemies on your side--leaving them on the field is a mistake. Trump offered many of his previous rivals a spot in his cabinet (Carson, Perry), or worked with them on state issues (Scott Walker), and it helped solidify the GOP behind him 100%.
[comment]Nobody with her numbers needs to be on that stage, but I’m a little concerned as to why the standards are always changing. Why not set the rules at the onset so all the campaigns know what to expect?
[comment]Where were those rules for Mike Bloomberg?
[comment]THANK GOODNESS
[comment]would bang
[comment]Why hasn't she dropped out yet? Every candidate that has preformed better than her has already dropped out.
[comment]Democratic Party: "Rules are rules, guys..Let the process work as is intended."

Also Democratic Party: "Let's go ahead and change the rules."
[comment]Is Tulsi Gabbard still running for President? If she is, has anyone told her?
[comment]Thank god. She's an ugly person on the inside. She's not needed in the party.
[comment]No body gives a rats ass what she has to say anyways.
[comment]Why is she even still running? I guess you get to keep those donations and you dont actually have to go to work. I wonder how many votes shes missed at this point?
[comment]Wow...there are a lot of Bernie Bros in here.  Oh wait...none of you are Bernie supporters?  

Why are you all acting like sexist, misogynistic conspiracy theorists, then?
[comment]She’s nuts
[comment]Any standard should eliminate that Russian stooge from the debate stage. This shouldn't be anything surprising. She's been polling dead last for a while now. Time to take your ill gotten gains and your Kremlin backed ass out of there Tulsi.
[comment]Raising the blinds
[comment]How will she whore for Russia if she can’t get on TV?
[comment]Tulsi Gabbard eliminates Tulsi Gabbard🪕🪕🪕
[comment]Only Billionaires can buy into these duh
[comment]Girl, bye.
[comment]What is her secret agenda I wonder.
[comment]She won't be present to...I dunno, stand there and be present.
[comment]"Please let me in the debate so I can attack you!"
[comment]Good.
[comment]People have already said it well here, but I feel that you can’t earn a spot on the debate stage just by refusing to drop out of a race you have clearly lost.
[comment]good
[comment]She’s a Russian asset anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Republicans are worried Trump will deliver Biden a landslide victory
[selftext]https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/us-election-2020-trump-joe-biden-economy-policies-republicans-democrats-a9537786.html[comment]Republicans need to be decimated as a political party.
[comment]They had three and a half years to do something about him.  They didn't.  Instead, they fully transformed into the party of really stupid traitorous greedy racist democracy haters.
[comment]If only they had a chance to remove him....
[comment]Wouldn't it be funny if Hillary just ran against him again?

She’d only need one campaign slogan:

“Are you better off today than you were four years ago?”
[comment]As long as people VOTE he will!
[comment]That's what the GOP thought during the 2016 election as well after the pussygrab video came out. But the deplorables just stuck with Trump's scam. I fear the bar has been lowered way down into hell this time around.
[comment]“If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it.” - Lindsey Graham
[comment]They should have thought of that in February when they covered for him.
[comment]Well they're certainly not acting like it.
[comment]Biden doesn’t have a chance
[comment]What I cant understand is this hill they are dying on.  They could right now, impeach Trump and convict him.  They can say, "We gave him every chance, but he never learned."  They can claim he was never a "true conservative," and then nominate some young, not racist guy that might look and sound better than Biden.  They could all stand there and say they "put country first" and people would buy it.  I think there are enough swing voters that would vote for a guy like that, or a Niki Haley type...Can you imagine those mother fuckers get a woman in first? Biden is not good in debate, he is not good on the campaign trail. He looks amazing because Trump is such a fucking idiot, but up against a suave, smart, attractive Republican (male or female) it would be hard.  So why are they willing to end it all right now for Trump?   



Because they're going to cheat.
[comment]Ah yes, pre-gloating.  A tactic that always returns victory, just ask Hillary Clinton and Al Gore.
[comment]Let just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange füher from office. Common America it’s time 🇺🇸
[comment]I mostly see posts that republicans are worried about an impending Biden landslide on democrat subs. This news while uplifting can unconsciously demotivate us to vote because ‘it’s in the bag’ so to speak.   I don’t know why we believe anything republicans say and truly, anything that could demotivate democrat voters to vote would surely be in their election playbook. 

OP no disrespect, we want to hear good news, but I felt so extremely whipped in 2016 that this similar message now coming from the republicans, that they are ‘worried’, is beginning to seem disingenuous on their part. Maybe it’s conspiracy theory, but they have a solid history of spreading propaganda. 

Downvote me to hades, if you must.
[comment]Landslide? Joe is damaging his campaign every time he opens his mouth. How is he going to debate when Freudian slips keep happening when cameras are on him?
[comment]Trump cultists haven’t budged. They love Trump even more now that he’s killed people with his lies and misinformation. They think he’s a hero and they’re “warriors” saving the economy from democRATs. Vote. Vote. For the love of God vote!
[comment]As a moderate, I try to see each issue on its merit rather than “My team says...” However- I believe that the current GOP needs to pay a serious political price for enabling this dangerous buffoon. A heavy, heavy toll that they will hopefully never forget. I have voted Republican before, but I don’t think I can ever do that again. Where did our honor go? Our values? Sure Obama and Bush made mistakes (Bush more than many) but they were good men, who tried to do what they thought was right.
[comment]Huh funny, I was just thinking the opposite
[comment]Just Vote.
[comment]Good.
[comment]tRump 😆 is killing himself because he's sooo stupid 😂
[comment]They should just forfeit the whole fucking thing and save everyone the time and money.
[comment]Biden looks boss af in that pic. That’s a commander in Chief!
[comment]Niggers
[comment]They can always send another candidate if they want.
[comment]The "good" news here is the ignorant orange asshole is incapable of changing his strategy. He is convinced he is infallible so it has to be right.
[comment]If we had more democracy and everyone voted all that would happen is the GOP would have to adopt some more popular positions. The horror!
[comment]All Biden hast to do is not interrupt Trump while he’s beating himself
[comment]It needs to be a landslide loss to make it harder for Trump to cheat and steal.
[comment]How about just saying F politics
[comment]Well....well they should be. Mabe it will help them with that self-reflection stuff. I hope anyway.
[comment]They had their chance to get rid of him.
[comment]Can’t believe it’s another shit show of choices....Guess I have to vote for the hair smelling rapist over the racist murderer smh
[comment]Doesn't matter what anyone says or thinks. VOTE. VOTE like your VOTE will be the deciding VOTE. And don't only VOTE in major elections. VOTE in all your local elections too. Your county website should have all the info. If you can't find it, ask your local library for help.
[comment]As rosy as the situation is now, it will be a lot worse by Election Day. The death toll will be 300,000+ and tens of millions will have gone months without any income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]10% of Trump 2016 voters might not vote for him in 2020 — The persuadable Trump voter could swing the election in November.
[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21173431/swing-voters-trump-2020[comment]I refuse to believe this until I see it.

Remember when 25% of Republicans were expected to stay home in 2016 because they thought Trump was so disgusting? Their embarrassment to publicly admit they want to vote for Trump doesn't make their vote for Trump disappear.
[comment]Encouraging but I’m not gonna count on it
[comment]After reading through the numbers it is estimated that 5-9% of Bernie supporters voted for Trump. Some of those will again.
[comment]I'm one of those switchers.

I did a lot of maturing between 2016 and 2020.
[comment]££
[comment]Given the age demographics of Republicans I would be surprised if 10% of Trump 2016 voters haven't died.
[comment]I would hope we could swing the election without them and they only matter in 3 states as we won the popular vote by over 3 million. The popular vote does not matter in our broken constitution with the electoral college compromise.
[comment]I never met a wishy-washy republican.
[comment]This presidential election is all about bringing out the base. The level of polarization the US electorate makes it unlikely to change anyone's mind about which team they support. Whoever does a better job bringing out their people to vote wins.
[comment]Great let's do m4a
[comment]We can only hope they find their way back.
[comment]50 percent of clintons voters may discover Joe to be more off-putting. So how will that balance out?
[comment]Well, I know at least one. My father's friend says that he regrets his vote and isnt dong it in 2020 VA.

But whoever wins the primary I am campaigning for.
[comment]Oh great! We are counting on a bunch of spoiled selfish conspiracy theorists to win the day. What could possibly go wrong?
[comment]Former Trump voter here, definitely not voting for this idiot in 2020, probably voting Bernie.

First, in my defense I grew up in a religion that made great efforts to isolate its followers from politics and while I did vote Obama twice I was just as ignorant then as I was in 2016(ignorant as in didn’t know shit about civics/politics/history/etc). It wasn’t until early 2018 that I seriously began educating myself, I did so specifically because the extreme emotional reaction I was having regarding politics made me uncomfortable(I know a lot about how cults operate having been in one and my reaction was textbook cult).

Anyway, I’ve been reading a lot of philosophy and found my views are far more liberal than even I realized, I was just too scared to have my own opinions before now as I was more concerned with slotting into a pre-made ideology(which is actually a result of the religious conditioning I was subjected to as a child). Once I developed this new found self confidence I started actively challenging my own views in a way I never had before and realized what I knew deep down the whole time: Trump is essentially a cult leader and I had fallen into another cult where it was unacceptable to challenge doctrine. This is my personal opinion however, so take it with a grain of salt.
[comment]He has a 92% approval rate among the voters and this Party is shitting on Sanders supporters.
[comment]I made a mistake in 2016 and voted for trump, but after all the slime ball shit  the past 3 1/2 years and with this mishandling of the pandemic, he lost a vote with me.
[comment]They may catch windmill cancer too if they aren’t careful.
[comment]Surprised its only 10%.
[comment]Could this be true?
[comment]What the article doesn't discuss is where these potential vote flippers are located.   If they tend to be in blue states anyway, it may not matter.
[comment]Seems like wishful thinking. My question is how many Democrats (especially young people) are gonna be put off by a candidate who is anti abortion, strongly opposed to expanding government healthcare, pro war and anti gay marriage? I mean at least Obama campaigned on changing things and fixing America's problems. Biden is campaigning on keeping things exactly the same. I mean he supported segregationists!! I think Trump wins vs. Biden, and to be honest seeing how bernie is doing I think Trump wins vs Bernie. Older Americans are afraid of Bernie. They got 30 years of anti communist propaganda and can't understand that bernie wants to enact programs like Canada, the UK, and Sweden, not like the USSR.

America just isn't ready.
[comment]Biden is gonna get destroyed in those coming debates. Do we believe that Biden will travel the country doing rally’s? It’s gonna be ugly, Drumpt is going to play nice like we’ve seen in these primaries. Drumpt is gonna attack Biden relentlessly, it’s gonna be ugly. Biden isn’t the same guy anymore, hasn’t been for a few years now.
[comment]I was willing to vote for pretty much anyone but Biden. The Democratic Party is on the verge of selecting the one candidate I would vote for Trump over. So count me out of that "10%".
[comment]Good. I don't want more Trump.
[comment]They would have voted for Bernie. They resented Obama’s turn against his 08 progressive politics. They got suckerd by trumps false populism. They won’t vote for an Obama era guy that suckerd them once already.
[comment]The victory lies with the swing/independent voters. Been saying it for two years. Motivate your friends to register and vote at Vote.gov
[comment]Don’t forget Putin.. he wants the puppet.. he’ll cheat for the win.
[comment]Trump is going to win again because our party just has no fucking clue how to unify.

Go on r/SandersForPresident \-- you'll find a huge number of people who will never vote for a democrat if Sanders loses.  

Republicans, they know what they're doing. Every single one of them is voting for trump.

Us, we're splittling votes between write ins, and 3rd party candidates. We don't know how to be pragmatic. Its pretty depressing.
[comment]Trump voters want an anti-establishment candidate. That candidate may be Trump and it may be Sanders, but it sure as hell ain’t Biden
[comment]that sounds about right. in the end, even 10% of the jim jones cultists refused to drink the koolaid (but had the needles forced into their arms)
[comment]If sanders doesnt make it im staying home, fuck it. Dems abandoned their base a long time ago.
[comment]So we need to go with a candidate that will pull those voters then.
[comment]Only 10%. People are so willfully ignorant.
[comment]That's okay, the disaffected Berniebros will vote for him again like they did in 2016 because they didn't get their way.
[comment]&gt; "... The persuadable Trump voter ..."

* you mean any Jethro with a double digit IQ?

No doubt even his most idiot Russian shill bot backers are getting tired of shooting themselves in the foot and voting against their own interest.

And I don't want to hear shit about those morons wanting to "get sucked up to heaven", or whatever bullshit they're talking about, because voting GOP is cutting your own throat, and you might want to consider by what you've been doing, you ain't eligible for the draft, if you get my meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Michelle Obama Is Mad at Black Voters, Not Trump Voters — Twice [in the "Becoming" documentary], she talks about how painful it is to her that black voters didn’t turn out to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling the decision not to vote more painful to her than those who voted for Trump.
[selftext]https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflixs-becoming-shows-michelle-obama-is-mad-at-black-voters-not-trump-voters[comment]She is awesome. I wish she would be our veep because she would make a fantastic president.
[comment]I'm mad at everyone who didn't vote for Hillary in 2016 too, but still pretends to be progressive. Great for those who are apologizing for that mistake and going to vote for Biden now, I guess though, but that doesn't bring back the countless thousands who have died as a direct result.
[comment]Uhgg.  Couldn't agree more.  Not only in 2016 but especially 2010.  First black president and black voters couldn't even be bothered to show up in 2010 and let the Tea Party take over.    The Dem party shoots itself in the foot a lot.
[comment]Imagine being a political party where you get angry at a certain race for voting a certain way or not living their lives how you decided they should live their lives. Almost sounds like this party is “Using” black people. What a shame.
[comment]What the hell is this shit? For one, black people don’t have to vote Democrat. For another, black people don’t have to vote for Hillary. And furthermore, black people don’t have to vote if they don’t like the candidates. But worst of all, [59.6% of black people turned out to vote in 2016.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/12/setting-the-record-straight-on-black-voter-turnout/) In 2012, 66.6% turned out and that was their highest turnout of all time. Black people voted in their strongest numbers ever for Obama and of course they did, he’s an inspiration. But Hillary wasn’t Obama. I don’t like this criticism. I don’t think it represents the facts well and I don’t think it represents black people well. I don’t like it.
[comment]Call me crazy but I think people should WANT to vote for you, not be forced to vote for you.
[comment]You should blame the candidate not the voters. If you can’t get people to vote for you, it’s your own fault (and also republican governors for voter suppression).
[comment]I feel the point she was making was more around, 'why DIDN'T you vote at all? those who voted for Trump at least voted, and spoke up about what they want to see in the country." Not voting just hurts the movement that she has been a part of building.
[comment]Let’s be real. Black people dont vote. Even if Kanye was running for president they won’t go out of their way to vote. I’m Asian and even I know Asian people won’t vote if it’s Andrew Yang
[comment]It is the citizen's responsibility to exercise their franchise. If you don't vote, you can't complain about what you get. With the number of people that didn't vote in the last election, you could have easily put a third party candidate in the White House or written in Bernie Sanders. Instead we have an incompetent, petulant, man-baby with his dick in one hand and his phone in the other.
[comment]Maybe if they nominated a candidate people actually wanted to vote for this wouldn't be a problem
[comment]44% of eligible voters didn't vote in 2016. Thats about average for every presidential election, Obama's second term was the highest turn out ever at 68%.
[comment]Michelle assumed an entire segment of society that shares the burden of (sometimes) hidden discrimination would understand that only a Democrat would protect Obama's legacy.  Trump made it very clear he was anti-Obama and would destroy any legacy left over. John Boehner and Mitch McConnell had made every piece of legislation Obama tried to pass an absolute ordeal. Michele is nothing if not loyal and she saw what her husband went through.  Maybe she assumed everyone would see as clearly.
[comment]Mad because Black voters either A didn’t want to vote for Hillary or B, voted for Someone other than Hillary. Imagine being mad at people for thinking for themselves. Pathetic
[comment]Trump voters have serious mental issues and don’t know any better.
[comment]2016 was tied for 2nd-highest turnout in the last 50 years. Tied with 2004, trails only 2008.
[comment]Or Democrats could try nominating someone who’s not had 30 years of baggage and right wing vitriol thrown at them, warping peoples opinion of them? Like her husband... 

But no, lets go with the lady everyone right of crazy hated and the guy who’s brain is melting. Good job, fellow primary voters!
[comment]She knows she never had sway with those people.
[comment]You can’t make voters turn out for an uncharismatic candidate.

We’re about to find out this same thing we already knew in this election. The only way Joe Biden will win is if Trump somehow makes a fool out of himself to his own supporters, but their standards have never been lower. Democrats have high standards but mediocre candidates, and that’s what always ends up costing us in turnout. We have to somehow beat the republican herd mentality.
[comment]All these people blaming others for the losses. Look to yourself! Did you phone bank? Did the Democrats do enough to reach out to would be voters? The fault is with you not those uninspired to vote for a candidate that failed to create enthusiasm.
[comment]Its about people NOT voting. Not people who voted  for so n so.
[comment]Because she knows how evil the Clinton's were to black people and that's why they didn't vote for her. Michelle Obama is Privileged AF and needs to wake up to this. She should've endorsed Bernie.
[comment]Even her enemies admit that Hillary is a great administrator. And it's time we all admit that Hillary's predictions have been right on the money. None of these problems would be happening if Hillary was President. And the Obama economy would still be chugging along and 70,000 Americans would still be alive.

Of course, we would still have problems. The Republicans would be on the 27th investigation of Benghazi and Fox would be demanding that the body of Vince Foster be exhumed.
[comment]Thank 👏 You 👏 Michelle 👏

I've seen the numbers and the amount of black voters that did not vote is exactly why Trump won.
[comment]NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. 

Hillary’s campaign was warned numerous times that something bad was happening in the rust belt and they ignored it every time. If they had pushed for turnout in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin they would have won. Wisconsin had implemented voter ID (suppressing turnout vs. 2012) so GOTV was even more vital than usual.

[comment]It's a right to vote Michelle there are choices
[comment]Why TF are dems still perplexed as to why people didn't come out to vote for the worst democratic candidate of most voters' lifetimes? Of course nobody came out to vote for Hillary, she was a terrible candidate.  I'm frankly surprised she got as much of the vote as she did.
[comment]I have said this multiple times and pissed off many friends: However dumb you think Trump voters are, someone who did not vote is automatically dumber.

For me it is just in super simple math terms. Whether you voted Trump or Clinton, that choice shows you are capable of comparing two numbers  and deciding which one is bigger. This is a very basic skill. 

Not voting is the equivalent of saying “I cannot tell you if -10 is greater than -1000, they are both negative so I refuse to compare them”
[comment]Being betrayed by a friend is much worse than being betrayed by an enemy.
[comment]You want politicians to listen to you and pander to you?  Vote!  Doesn’t matter if you don’t like either of them this time. 

First of all stop voting for the charismatic guy. Vote for the smartest guy. Stop voting for “slick” Good on TV assholes.  You don’t have to work with him, he/she just has to make the best decisions on your behalf.

But back to my main point. The next election, if politicians see that 90% of young voters turned out...guess who they are coming around to pander to?  90% of black voters turned out?  Guess who they are coming to see and listen to?  IT.  DOES. MATTER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Joe Biden: "I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America.

[comment]Trump shirked responsibility again, he didn’t want to upset his cult, instead threw the governors under the bus because he wants to be liked, goddamn he’s a fucking child, a true leader with leadership skills would have backed the governors not incite the protesters.
[comment]Not to mention Nazi flags 卐 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
[comment]Leadership.
[comment]Too bad they're all forms of speech and therefore protected under the first amendment to the Constitution.   

Not that Dems care about that old piece of paper once they're offended or scared...
[comment]Lol. Joe Biden didn't say that. His side maybe wrote that. There is no way that guy could formulate a coherent thought such as this good try. I would like to even see Joe Biden read that on camera without fuxking it up.
[comment]Regardless of ones feelings. I myself care not for the Confederate Flag or Swastikas. However, my indifference is that regardless of how one feels, there’s Freedom of Speech in our nation. When you take away first amendment rights, you are open to taking other rights away from the people.
[comment]Fuck Trump and his eighth grade drop out followers.
[comment]It's "funny" how these kind of protests always involve confederate flags and nazi symbols no matter what the purported aim of the protest is.
[comment]Wish his spoken sentences were as coherent
[comment]Sigh. Yeah this dude is way better than the Devil himself
[comment]I think it's funny that one of my favorite genres of music is southern rock, yet I agree with this.
[comment]Will he also say that all Americans should have access to free healthcare?

Probably not.

Why get the whole sandwich when you can get the crumbs?
[comment]Biden is actually racist though. Why wouldn't the democrat party want to get rid of him instead of letting him infect the party and ruin public perception of the party?
[comment]I love it, don’t vote for 1 scumbag but vote for the other scumbag. Gotta love it
[comment]About time he got a voice-SPEAK UP FOR JOE

[comment]I'm a simple man. I see biden, I downvote.
[comment]Yeah I’m glad he said this and all but.... is this really the bar we’ve set now?
[comment]He didn't "say" this he tweeted it.
[comment]Just a heads up, the pic of the guy with a swastika/nazi flag was someone mocking Trump/Pence during a Bernie rally *years* ago.  Reddit figured it out a few hours after the images were posted but i just wanted to mention in case someone missed it.

I only mention it because of the Republicans victim-card-spidy-senses get all tingly when you bring up swastikas. Its a perfect opportunity for them to do what they do, avoid the overall point about these protests.
[comment]Let's start a task force, that goes around, finds people that have thse flags flying, and bulldoze their houses!
[comment]Does anyone actually believe Biden said that?

[comment]Swastikas were around way before Hitler used them. And in the USA too. I’m Native American, and we (the Osage) used the swastika as a symbol for various positive things.. “well-being” is one such example and I believe there is another we used specifically but I don’t remember. It just got stolen by Hitler, unfortunately.
[comment]Anything to direct attention from his raping ways.
[comment]Don't forget that Democrats were the KKK after the Civil War or has that fact conveniently been ignored.

Lets put the same legal action on any station that puts his lies on the air.
[comment]OMG! This is so cute! This thing has already gone viral on social media. LOL

[comment]All the caterwauling about the 2nd amendment, and these faux defenders of the constitution can't even tell you what the 1st amendment is. If they only put coherent Trump statements he stood behind into an advertisement, it would be shorter than his pudgy little fingers.
[comment]But he did.
[comment]\#thetrumpvirus
[comment]When you don't have a leg to stand on, but you try to teeter your ass to an upright position...
[comment]Discovery. Simple. Trump is using legal action as a form of intimidation. It’s the Devin Nunes playbook.
[comment]So, they want to sue because the ad tells the truth. 🤔 Good luck with that.
[comment]I love how he just calls everything that even remotely threatens his position of power a “hoax”.
[comment]Priorities USA should counter with “we’ll cover all your legal fees if you are sued by the Trump campaign”.
[comment]SLAPP suits 101, and he’ll sue in West Virginia where they don’t require a prima facia case.
[comment]Hey Trump lemme just pull out the world's smallest violin real quick.
[comment]..... he did though
[comment]Please find the audio of him actually saying the virus itself is a hoax.  There is your answer to this headline.
[comment]I swear if they cave under this bullshit threat then they're part of the damn problem. *Everyone* gives in to him. Everyone backs down. 

Paste this link all over the damn internet folks.

https://youtu.be/G5TZ6fTYrsE

And let's be clear here. Fact-checkers, in my opinion, are *also* caving. They say it's not fair to say Trump called it a hoax. This is the full quote that they say clears that up:

&gt;“Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it.  We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ ‘Oh, nothing, nothing.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. ... And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that’s been pretty amazing.”

You tell me. *What* exactly is he calling a hoax? The claim he's not doing anything? Because the rest of the ad has all the quotes you need proving *that* interpretation too.

This is bullshit and we have got to stop taking it. If fact-checkers and journalists aren't going to, then we damn well better.
[comment]But he did, though.
[comment]How the hell can reality be unfair to Donald j drumpf or any like-minded person when he/they think the alternate reality that they believe in is actual reality.
[comment]Let em sue then use that against them too
[comment]Sure thing, right after Fox News goes off forever. 

BTW trump is famous for his past bullshit threats of legal action.
[comment]It's plainly established precedent. In the US truth is an absolute defense to libel or slander.

Let him file the suit and lose, or more likely have the judge take one look at it and throw it out. In the meantime the very charade will just further sink any chance he has of winning.
[comment]So what? Let em let him sue. Roll the tape!
[comment]This is one of those times where you should’ve been more open minded and diplomatic Don. I think those excepts fall under fair use. Not much can be done to stop it from happening.
[comment]Yeah but he did! Like it's crazy that they deny he says stuff that is on video with those words coming out of his mouth. I've heard this before. Yeah he said the "corona virus, just another democratic hoax" but yeah you see when he says that hes not calling the virus a hoax hes calling the democrats a hoax! Really, come on! I've heard this from my Republican family members.
[comment]“This is their new hoax.”

[comment]How dare they broadcast factual information! Damn liberal media.
[comment]Trump was tweeting some of the meanest crap against Obama when he was fighting a pandemic just for attention and his agenda. If you can't stand the heat, get outta the kitchen.
[comment]God he is stupid!
[comment]What is this word, alleging? Let’s replace with stating.
[comment]The networks need too have some courage for once and keep running the ad. They would have no chance in court with this, the discovery period would be truly enlightening and damaging to him with every deceptive advert he's ever run (practically all off them) and his constant slander of others brought up and nationally reported. How can these people accuse slander when he slanders everyone everyday? It's the boy who cried wolf. The advert is accurate and people need to see it.
[comment]Calling Michael Bloomberg - he could nullify this scare tactic in a second by pledging protection for entities threatented by the dictator's campaign.
[comment]HAHAHHAHAHAH
[comment]But those words left his mouth, and the sound and lightwaves within his vicinity were captured on a recording device, and then that media was publicly posted...but I can see why he would say that, half of his die-hard supporters probably think google is part of the deep state and look up their info on lycos search
[comment]Last election, Trump suggested Ted Cruz' father had something to do with JFK's assassination. But now he's being treated unfairly. I've never heard a rich dude use the word "unfair" so often.
[comment]He did, its on video. Clear proof. Let him sue. He'll loose. Then counter sue for damages, and he'll loose again. Call the bluff.
[comment]The caption to this post uses the term "alleging". WTF? There is no alleging. It's on video.
[comment]Sooo...let him sue?  because he doesn't have a case??  

This is the authoritarian answer yo everything here in the US.  Sue and bankrupt everyone that farts in the wrong direction.  Devin Nunez pulled that shit too.

Let them bankrupt themselves.
[comment]That will be an amazingly easy lawsuit for the TV stations and add creator to win considering he's on tape several times calling it a hoax and a democratic hoax!
[comment]It’s just a tactic to either get it taken down or neuter it by turning it into a “he said, she said.”  Sometimes I can’t tell if concerns noted in these threads are made in good faith or fake.
[comment]What is the basis for the legal action?
[comment]Every anti trump ad should just play his lies along with a graphic or video of the actual truth. Every word out of his stinking face hole is a lie so there should be mountains of material to work with.
[comment]But he did say that. It's not defamation if it's the truth. He said it. We have him on video saying it.
[comment]Alleging?

He actually did.
[comment]Does anyone have a link to the ad?
[comment]&gt; However, fact-checkers at The Washington Post, Snopes, Politifact and FactCheck.org have said it’s wrong to claim that Trump called the virus a hoax.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, Trump’s full quote reveals that he was describing Democratic efforts to politicize the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it,” Trump said in February. “We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ ‘Oh, nothing, nothing.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. ... And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that’s been pretty amazing.”

&amp;#x200B;

They could edit the ad and take the hoax part out.  It is still damaging without it given all the other crap he said about it being under control.
[comment]He actually ranted that democrats were criticizing the response and that criticism was purely political and a hoax.  The criticism was dead on!

We should run with this, because it makes the Democratic opposition look intelligent and even prescient and makes him look like a bigger idiot for his botched response!

I'd love to see somebody do an ad or video that shows Dem politicians saying what he should have been doing or was he did wrong and then show his rant over the increasing number of cases.

&gt;**Now  the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right?  Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You  say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’  They have no clue. They don’t have any clue.** They can’t even  count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They  can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr.  President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t  work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment  hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they  tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all  turning, they lost, it’s all turning. **Think  of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did  something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people \[cases of  coronavirus infection\] in this massive country. And because of the fact  that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than  that.**

<|startoftext|>[title]Biden Now Leads With Most Senior Demographics — Older Americans' Support for Trump Has Collapsed — "Let Grandma Die" Proves Unpopular With Grandma
[selftext]https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/[comment]65-75 are considered the most reliable age group to vote. And the most susceptible age group to life-ending coronavirus.

We need to start pushing vote-by-mail as our national standard during a global pandemic. Just in case that second wave hits about that time.
[comment]Boomers only care when it impacts them
[comment]Biden is more popular than Hillary Clinton. I hope it’s enough to make a difference.
[comment]Ya, lets see how this works out when grandma needs to create a facebook account and log on to the internet to vote.
[comment]Except my grandma... and aunts and parents. I can't make them see the reality of the situation that has been entirely trump's fault.
[comment]ive never voted for a republican and ive lived a long time
[comment]Don't worry. They'll find something for Grandma to be scared of more than them, and they will drive that fear all the way to election time.
[comment]Love it. If grannies mad at the orange turd, it's over.
[comment]Maybe it’s because Biden seems older so he’s more relatable
[comment]Let’s hope it’s enough. It’s only our entire democracy that’s on the line after all
[comment]And us the youth who will have to live with this new world after this blows over in a couple YEARS wanted Bernie the one time that the youth the least reliable age group came out in force Biden shows the fuck up and splits the fucking vote. If he loses it’s fucking over.
[comment]Republicans have always gotten 0% support with this grandpa.
[comment]I'm not sure why but polls don't pick up on the voting preferences of certain lower income republicans. We should ignore all these polls.
[comment]I would like to hear more stories about people who voted for Trump, but changed their minds. I seen a video about people who voted for Trump in 2016 because they thought he was going to help them. Well looking at things now, and how things were happening, they changed their minds.
[comment]I think Joe Biden feels like a safe option for a lot of seniors.  These people have lived through a lot, they know nonsense when they here it.
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.
[comment]Let Grandma Die Proves Unpopular with Grandma 
🤣🤣🤣
[comment]"What a twist!"

Also, saw a quote from an unnamed investment banker on the reopening of the economy. Sounded like Moriarty from Sherlock. The gist of it was,
"People die, that's what people do. People need to start taking responsibility for their lives."
[comment]I don’t see any references to a let grandma die message?
[comment]Pray it is so!!
[comment]If this holds on the election day it will be a bloodbath. I have concerns so everyone vote.
[comment]It's funny now, how conservatives try to spin "death panels" would happen under Obamacare and here we are in 2020 where conservative led "death panels" are choosing who lives and dies from COVID 19.
[comment]So glad to be going back to trying to appeal to the demographic that votes hand over fist for every corporate stooge that pops up. /S
[comment]Well we’re screwed then because I live ( minutes from Iowa, and they already opened everything back up. People from Illinois are going over there to shop and eat. Then bring back the germs to Illinois
[comment]Trump's gambit was that most of the casualties would be in the cities and that they would die in time for election day. We have to be careful and actively prevent that from paying off for him.
[comment]This feels so off, I hate both candidates but I’ve never heard someone who was a Biden supporter
[comment]I'll believe it when I see it. Old people have spent the last 40 years believing literally every conspiracy theory that has ever been thought of no matter how inane. All it'll take is one email blast about how Biden is working with the U.N. to put Christians into reeducation camps or some shit. Then grandma will go running back to the GOP.

We must stop whining and outvote the old. Tweets aren't votes. Posts on Reddit aren't votes.
[comment]The question to me isn't how he is polling in different demographics, is how there is one single American out there that still supports him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Bernie Sanders endorses Joe Biden for president
[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/bernie-sanders-endorses-joe-biden-for-president.html[comment]Why is there no post on this sub about the allegations against Joe Biden? It's been picked up by the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/d922da60baa91121f4529fe51a0fd55a) now, it feels like something we should be able to discuss as Democrats.
[comment]Vice President Sanders... I know I know it won’t happen but... /sigh
[comment]*always blue!*

*always blue!*
[comment]United we stand. Let's do this people.
[comment]Let's go boys!  I wish he was VP but it'll never happen
[comment]Blue till I die, but it’s going to be a hard battle.
[comment]FLIP THE SENATE
[comment]Now let's get out there and beat Trump. Time to take the country back.
[comment]Let's move forward United.
[comment]To my fellow Sanders supporters,

You can't kill an idea. He may have dropped out, but his ideas and goals live on. Bernie has shifted the party and even Biden is adopting some of his policies. Short term goal is to beat trump. Long term: Make America Better for everyone. Equality. Education. Medicare for all. We can do this. United.
[comment]As a Sanders supporter I'm still bitter, but I know the ultimate goal.
[comment]Im voting for the guy, but I’m bitter as hell that Biden is running to the right of Hillary.
[comment]Meh, who cares. The real power to make change is in the senate anyways
[comment]I'm sure it was tough one for Bernie. I guess anything is better than Anoying Orange we have as president now. Maybe.
[comment]:/
[comment]RBG will NOT survive another 4 years. Bernie supporters need to chin up and realize that we’re not just fighting for the presidency, we’re fighting for the Supreme Court, so stop with the “never voting for Biden” crap. If Trump wins and gets to nominate another judge, we are going to get screwed for the next 20-30 years.
[comment]Glad to see Democrats coming together after a hard fought primary. We may have disagreed on certain issues, but going into the general election we can all be glad to see the most progressive platform for any Democratic nominee in history.
[comment]I'd vote for one of Biden's turds over Trump
[comment]Everybody still needs to vote for Sanders to maximize his delegate count and power to influence the Democratic party and turn it into something that people can actually get excited to vote for.
[comment]What would you like?  4 years of potential mediocrity with Biden or 4 MORE years of the circus we have right now?  We need to band together folks, even if our favorite candidate didnt get the nomination...
[comment]Ok Biden supporters,  take all that energy of guilting sanders supporters into voting for Biden and instead get your asses out to canvass. If he loses, there will be no one to blame but yourselves.
[comment]Sanders should be vice president. Just for the simple fact that he has so many behind him.
[comment]Sigh
[comment]Not me, us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Mask and all, Biden crushes Trump
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/opinions/biden-mask-trump-ghitis/index.html[comment]At this point, just duck Trump.
[comment]The stars aligned for Biden. He is an awful speaker and now all he has to do is put a mask on and let Trump tweet to look presidential.

Trump is going to go out spectacularly, I guarantee we will look back on May 2020 Trump and go, "wow that guy was pretty sane!"
[comment]Okay, but still vote. Like, Biden only crushes Trump where it counts if EVERYONE VOTES. So VOTE.
[comment]Don't buy into this narrative. Consider that Trump and his supporters are the exact kind of people who would deliberately LIE to the pollsters just to see false information spread out there.
[comment]The only power we have is to withhold our vote until he takes serious action on climate crisis and Medicare for All.
[comment]You're right! we shouldn't ask for anything from politicians five months before an election!
[comment]No. Organizing and asking for reasonable, popular policies like Medicare for All (wanted by 70%+ of Dems) , and in a world where 35 million people lost their employer based healthcare in the past ten weeks... And you're telling me to vote for a mouse? What the fuck is wrong with you?
[comment]Great. Two disgusting old rich white men. 

Again.
[comment]Sorry Biden is going to lose without the left this time unless he moves on Medicare for All and Climate Crisis. All my leftist friends are going to sit this out.
[comment]Trump and his cult can spew whatever bullshit they can but between the RayBans and the black mask Biden looks presidential.
[comment]I'm voting a straight Blue ticket and for any candidate that runs against Trump. 

Not voting in this critical election is not a protest, it's a vote for Trump and his enablers.
[comment]Currently masks are worn ONLY to stop the spread of Covid-19 not preventing the wearer from getting the virus. I understand both perspectives on this, but if Trump wore a mask the only reason would be to provide a figurehead to encourage the public to wear them. As a president he doesn’t in order to appear more confident on the world stage. Biden doesn’t need that confidence until he’s president (also he isn’t tested as often as Trump).
[comment]Not just vote. vote for every Democratic candidate you can in every election everywhere. Anyone in the party that supports trump is morally bankrupt.
[comment]Ninja ~~Gaiden~~ Biden
[comment]Lets run up the score and humiliate Trump. We need to vote in numbers never seen before.  Destroy Trump's brand.
[comment]One of these two guys walks into a liquor store to rob the place. Which one do you take seriously (from the picture above)?
[comment][totally ](https://imgur.com/gallery/qWB8155)
[comment]LOL. Masks are the ultimate political statement in 2020: http://mask.vote
[comment]Bahaha a CNN article
[comment]tRump's killing his chances for a second term all on his own, why you ask... because he's stupid 😂
[comment]I would vote for a potato if it was blue
[comment]He looks like a supervillain with the mask on.

*And I'm not complaining, it looks awesome.*
[comment]Trump sucks, but you guys might isolate the far-left who voted for sanders. There is the sentiment that Biden was the worst candidate to chose, and so they might vote green. In order to entice this group of voters, Biden would need to adopt some basic sanders policies like M4A, and forgiving student loan debt. He really needs to go further left. Some of them even thought warren wasn’t radical enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Moderate Democrats have a duty to consider Sanders. He has a clear path to beating Trump.
[selftext]https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/09/bernie-sanders-could-beat-donald-trump-2020-column/4694526002/[comment]It is a two-way street.
[comment]Bernie is consistent and has a lifetime of supporting the empowerment of others. But probably just as important is that he has bold, aggressive, enthusiastic supporters who are more than able to fight back against the lies of the religious Reich. If Bernie is the nominated Democrat you will see an ocean of noise, color and movement rising to counter the barking dogs, thumping bibles and lie spewing rhetoric that every fundamentalist/baptist/pentecostal church in America will be spreading like the Coronavirus to gullible, naive people. Bernie supporters are aggressively armed with facts, and fueled by the aggression of knowing that peace, love and hope kisses won't defeat a hitler wannabee. I am all for unity within party. In fact, I am a Warren supporter and have raised thousands of dollars for her this year. But last time (when I was dumb enough to support Stein) it was local Clinton supporters who were antagonizing the Bernie supporters.  And we see that Hillary just can't keep her bitter, forked tongue mouth shut. So, it feels hypocritical to call for unity when Bernie has suffered sabotage, and a media blackout. The aggressive Bernie supporters are simply raising the volume to not be covered up by the corruption. The stakes are high in this election. This is Bernie's last chance. I understand their passion. And I support it.

Edited because...sugar.
[comment]Yea, if he wins the nomination sure. For now i’ll support a candidate who can win and won’t be a leftist trump
[comment]I promise if Bernie wins the primary, he will have my vote in the general. I am also not yet decided on who I am voting for in the primary, but it’s likely not Bernie. It’s definitely not Biden however (in the primary that is). General election Democrat gets my vote. Blue no matter who.
[comment]I live in a very red state. I always vote for Democrats. If Bernie is the nominee, I will have a very hard time voting for him, becuase he is not a Democrat either, and has spent most of his lifetime hating Democrats. JFK made him sick? He wanted someone to primary Obama? My vote won't matter in the overall totals in my state, so I wish I could leave it blank, but I will vote for him on a Tuesday and work to primary him on Wednesday.
[comment]I'm on team Pete but ultimately will vote blue whoever gets the nomination.
[comment]And Bernie's base has a duty to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
[comment]This is what can turn people away from voting Democrat . Basically says that you should only vote for someone because they have a high chance of beating that other guy not because they agree with him.
[comment]I would vote for Bernie if he gets the nom but I think this article is bunk. The real danger here is that Bernie getting the nom would likely send Wall Street into a frenzy. They have already been trying to stave off an overdue recession, having Trump running around telling everyone their 401k's are about to go up in flames would only set people off. Do you really think the boomers are going to do the right thing and vote with their conscience when their retirement is on the line?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Yale professor warns time running out for Americans to stop Trump dictatorship.
[selftext]https://www.businessinsider.com/authoritarianism-experts-say-time-running-out-americans-to-stop-trump-2020-2[comment]I fear we missed that window.
[comment]When he suspends/ignores the elections this year, it's going to be too late.
[comment]I seem to remember other people worrying about the same thing with Mr. Obama. He'll serve another term, and live in retirement (but probably still be in the news, occasionally).
[comment]Guys, come on. As someone that leans conservative, I can assure you that the vast majority of my conservative friends and people I know would not stand for a dictator regardless of political affiliation. It goes against our core beliefs in upholding the constitution. If trump tried to suspend elections, we would be shoulder to shoulder with everyone to remove him from office.
[comment]once the masses are living paycheck to paycheck they don't have time to participate or protest as much.
[comment]So he’s going with the Libya model? How does that one end again?
[comment]Time to dust off that 2nd amendment and take a stand against tyranny. 

Sadly, I fear there are many who would use those same words to defend a despot.
[comment]Probably no coincidence this was released the same day it was exposed that Yale and Harvard have been hiding foreign money.
[comment]I started r/TheNonsilentMajority after reading this. 

I think there's a space for anyone who has an issue with the escalation of power in the Executive Branch, or the abetting and indulgence happening within the majority of the Republican Party of Washington. I know there's the Political Revolution subreddit, but I think there needs to be a neutral space less affiliated with progressive candidates (despite common goals) to allow anyone who doesn't want egregious breaches of our democratic values to be further normalized. Voting is a huge piece. Donating, Volunteering too. But we have to declare, with our voice, and our presence, that we will not give the players in this game a blind pass.
[comment]I really don’t think it will be close at all. Dems might even win Georgia and Arizona maybe Texas too
[comment]Sometimes I wonder if we'll ever truly be able to come back from this.
[comment]In all my life, I have never feared for our country's future like a do now!!
[comment]Except it's literally not a dictatorship.
[comment]Exactly
[comment]Marsha Blackburn and other “R” friends are currently blocking bills from being passed that tighten election security.
It’s obviously working out for them.
[comment]Minus a few details but chillingly close, I read an article about two years ago that laid out exactly how this day and worse was coming.  I believe the author was a young American professor of Indian (Asia) decent.  For the life of me, I can’t find it again. At the time, I had posted it here, but it was promptly removed because it was a freelance journalist portal not whitelisted and I’ve since deleted my old account.  At any rate, what I want to say is, the writing was on the wall from the beginning. Many people saw and understood it. Unfortunately, his base didn’t, still don’t, and probably never will until it’s too late. They all suffer from severe tunnel vision and can’t see the impropriety in their beloved leader because they are too busy chasing the proverbial carrot he's dangling.  When it’s all over and done with and they find themselves completely alienated, I will be the first to say, we fucking told you so- now move out of the way.
[comment]That Yale professor clearly does NOT understand what a dictatorship is.   Under a dictatorship like  Kim Jong-un's, only one way of thinking is allowed.  Anybody who disagrees with the ruler ends up dead or in prison.   If Antifa (the best example of fascism in the modern world) were to rule the US somehow, they would morph from fascism to true dictatorship getting as ugly as it can possibly get.

Whether you love or hate Donald Trump, he is not a dictator, nor does he want to be one.
[comment]Perhaps the professor forgot about the Women in pussy hats, BLM, ANTIFA, the Women's march, March for Our Lives, etc.  Marching will not work, because it's been done and has not worked.
[comment]Occupy Washington
[comment]I'm going to be 72 in a few months, demonstrated against the war in Viet Nam when I was young and have demonstrated against Trump and his administration several times.  In all of the recent demonstrations I have observed a lack of young adults, specifically Millennials, and have wondered what the fuck they are thinking!  The Yale professor is right:  It is way past the time to take to the streets . . . so get out there if you haven't already made plans to do so.  We Boomers will be dead soon, and the country will be yours, so grab onto it now before assholes like Trump take it away from you.  My rant.

PS.  Bernie alone is not going to save you.  You have to work for it.
[comment]When he won the election I thought well this is going to be batshit crazy times. It’s 10x worse.
[comment]Wow that hand is in the foreground
[comment]First things we’re doing in the Trump Regime 2.0 is drilling for oil in Yellowstone and nuking mexico to get rid of the cartels.  Buckle up and get ready to get fucked. 🍆
[comment]I love how this photo appears to make his head gigantic and his hand tiny.

[comment]No one...No one on Earth has faced the decades long gauntlet of ridicule and partisan  investigations that Hillary has.   


While the Republicans wasted multi-million of taxpayer dollars on whipping-post investigations to churn out their voters and snag independents, they nevertheless  VETTED Hillary as the ideal candidate...because they found nothing indictable. Please note how the Republicans quietly, oh so quietly, released their investigation findings so their voters would never read the truth. In all of congressional  investigations and in all the endless hours of Fox News malicious speculation, there was nothing indictable. She survived decades of Republican bullshit. That's fucking badass.  What you see here is Viking-level badassery:  to survive a 30+ year long 24/7 tornado of media/investigative malfeasance and yet people still fuckin care more whether she's wearing make up than the point she's making:   WEAR A FUCKING MASK and VOTE.

[selftext]https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/opinion/trump-senate-acquittal-impeachment.html[comment]Craven cowards. Disgusting.
[comment]The dumbasses do realize that by removing him from office he may also be arrested and no longer a threat right?
[comment]Fear *and* greed. Not necessarily in that order.
[comment]Trump has probably spent his morning planning on revenge on Romney.
[comment]So the Republican strategy is that they think it looks better to be in fear of the president than to be a sycophantic bootlicker. Well, I have news for them whether they're one or the other both look pretty effing bad.
[comment]Typical of tyrannical regimes. Hitler's sycophantic hangers-on were afraid to wake him up to let him know the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy. Same for Stalin when the Nazis had crossed their Western border on the road to Moscow.

The end is near.
[comment]Simply put:

I hope it haunts them for the rest of their lives if he starts doing things that can no longer be excused. Things that actually keep them up at night. Arguably he already is, but it hasn't been enough to bother them (yet.)

People dying. Different parts of the government collapsing. The United States itself falling into disrepair. That's all on them.

They knew exactly what sort of shit Trump would immediately do if they let him off the hook for this, so EVERY BIT OF SUFFERING that comes after is THEIR fault.
[comment]I look forward to seeing the reactions when he turns on his party.
[comment]They all have partaken of russian money
[comment]makes no sense. If they convicted and removed him, he would no longer be a danger. There is more to the story we are not hearing (i.e. funding from the RNC).
[comment]Makes what Romney did all the more impressive.
[comment]That's why republicns do everything: they are afraid of everything all the time
[comment]bunch of cowards
[comment]The word to describe that is coward.
[comment]And?
[comment]Just like an abused partner.
[comment]Chicken sh*ts. All of ‘Em.
[comment]Cowards and Crooks
[comment]I don't think it is Trump, per se.  Though he is a complete asshole, really he himself is limited.  Rather, if you oppose Trump, you oppose his vocal, and let's face it, fucking looney bin supporters.  Your office will be deluged with hate mail, all sorts of threats made, family members intimidated, and probably a few real and legit threats will come to fruition.  Also, the big money supporters will walk away.  For Romney, he doesn't care.  For some farmboy like Cory Gardner?  Not only will you loose reelection, but you will not get a job afterwards.  So these Senators are looking at loosing their current gig, and then no opportunities later.
[comment]Well no shit! If he goes down, they all go down. If he gets imprisoned, they all get imprisoned. Mob Rules
[comment]Yellow-belly cowards...
[comment]I understand democrats are angry, but this article is just pretending to know people's inner thoughts.
[comment]Their districts are so gerrymandered, Trump can hold them prisoner. But only if they are cowards.
[comment]Fear of what tho?! You cowards WERE the check and balance. You stepped aside and now we all are afraid since he has no check. 

You could have done what’s right and the risk to you already rich people was losing re-election. You woulda been fine monetarily too.
[comment]Cowards! We're led by cowards.
[comment]No they didn’t, they did it for the money. If they would have impeached him, he would have been removed from office , then the fbi, state dept, and CIA, would have resumed all pending investigations and put his ass in jail or have him die in an accident.
[comment]Marco Rubio literally said Trumps actions meet the bar for impeachment and then says he he won’t impeach because this is partisan. Not voting what you believe is what is making it partisan.
[comment]Spineless cowards who piss on the constitution because they are afraid of his voters.
[comment]Of what? His tiny baby hands?
[comment]Shit ton of money helps with that.
[comment]That just really shows what cowards they are.  And makes Romney seem even more brave by comparison
[comment]Cowards, isn’t the GOP the party of tough guys, or so they tell everyone
[comment]Fucking cowards.
[comment]Most of dictatorship have started with the abdication of Legislative chambers.
[comment]Republicans have no spine, and are cowards.
[comment]Fear of what!!?? He only has the power they give him! If they showed him they were in charge they could make him their pussy instead of the other way around!
[comment]The GOP are a bunch of little wimps, except Romney.

Romney is an extremely respectable Republican.
[comment]Even Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, caved. What is he afraid of?
[comment]Fear of what Russians meddling in the elections and ruining the country?
[comment]They're not afraid of Trump. They're afraid of Putin, the puppeteer.
[comment]Lol
[comment]They're not scared. They're psychopaths.
[comment]The senate vote should have been anonymous.


No retaliation danger.
[comment]The fear that stokes so many people is death more than losing one's job and that's why so many of these warhawks in the Republican party like Trump and Cheney had multiple deferments,and now would gladly send other people's children to die. That's just plain cowardly but now they're even below the standard of cowardice. They fear the idea of losing their jobs over the loss of a fragile democracy. It should validate to anyone with half a brain that their true core worship is money and nothing else. Money over morals, ethics, integrity and love of country. The Democrats should remind people every day of what these people stand for; make their worst fear a reality in November.
[comment]I’m tired of hearing all this “behind closed doors repubs know drumpt is wrong” ...repubs don’t care, let’s stop making excuses for their coward behavior!
[comment]Walk away from the Democratic party!!  I did and couldn't be happier.  This type of irresponsible ranting is just rediculous.  Wake up and think, read, and read counter arguments!
[comment]I’ve never seen stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep take so long to finish someone, especially one as deserving as Mad King Donald.
[comment]I understand the anger, but this is an opinion piece-- not an article. Moreover, the piece does not cite any Republican (on or off the record).
[comment]That's because they are gutless. I repeat, gutless.  Let me say that one more time, GUTLESS.  Moral decadence has never made a quantum leap downward quite like this one.
[comment]They’re afraid of the wrong thing.
[comment]You know guys, this is an objective assessment - don’t get angry - please: 

the House rushed impeachment. They needed to build up the evidence for PR purposes. If you compare how Nixon was removed with how this House moved forward... it’s like night and day... in 1974 the House voted 410-4 to begin an impeachment inquiry. That’s not a typo: 410-4!!!!    

US District Court, and the Court of Appeals and then the US Supreme Court ordered Nixon to produce the tapes... several of Nixon’s aides were tried and found guilty... his AG and deputy AG resigned... Republican Senators went to the White House and told him to quit... I mean the sky was falling... 

That’s what it takes to remove a President and I think we rushed it in case. I just hope it does not backfire.
[comment]What if Trump actually literally goes mad?  He seems sometimes to be on the verge.  And now he's enraged after the impeachment and the Rush Limbaugh scandal, etc.
[comment]They’ll be too afraid to do anything when Trump decides he’s going to make himself president for life. Seriously people, we better have a plan for when this guy decides he’s not going to give up power.
[comment]Fake news
[comment]So proud that Sherrod Brown is my senator.
[comment]I emailed both of my fucking senators and told them exactly what I thought of them. I called them out for cowards and told them I was appalled that they sold out the American people, and basically said they are dead to me. I hope those emails ruin both of their fucking days.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Yes. It turns out the Trump fired the CDC expert on China as well as the pandemic response team.
[comment]This wouldn’t have happened if Bernie Sanders had been nominated, AND we would have had the healthcare and financial infrastructure already in place to handle a pandemic.

Go figure!
[comment]Any other functional adult would have handled this better
[comment]Hillary did win, by 3,000,000 votes. Putin weaponized congenital idiocy to exploit a flaw in our election process.
[comment]Besides general incompetence and leadership failures on trumps part this country would be ducked regardless maybe to a slightly lesser degree with anyone else in charge.  No sick leave, no national healthcare with 30 million uninsured, and a complete disregard for the poor would have ducked us regardless of who is in charge.
[comment]Maybe we could talk about people who are currently involved in the democratic party and our politics? like i get it, it sucked. We were all there. 

What we need right now is the party to start asking themselves why we're not hearing anything out of Biden right now. Sanders is out there raising money and organizing and Joe is "working 4-5 hrs a day" and "reading memos" 

I'd really like to hear a lot more from him right now, especially considering that he is supposed to be the front runner
[comment]oh hell no this wouldn't have happened if she won but if it did happen it would be nothing like this because she's not a stupid mother fucker, whether you like Hillary Clinton or dislike her you can't say she is not one of the smartest political women in US history. Whether you like or dislike Donald j drumpf you definitely can't say he's one of the smartest politicians in history he's actually one of if not the dumbest people I've ever seen but not just in politics this guy is just plain stupid.
[comment]It would have happened. Maybe the response would be different. But the virus would have happened either way. 

It's delusional to believe the virus wouldn't have happened or it would have acted different. The virus doesn't care who the American president is. It's busy infecting the other 6.7 billion people in the world not American.
[comment]The markets would still have crashed and she would lose the next election to some sort of REAL fascist.
[comment]But all those Bernie supporters told me Trump and Hillary were literally the same....
[comment]You know what I tell the morons on the right? I tell them to live in the here and now. Forget about Hillary and move on. This post is stupid.
[comment]Hillary was great and it is a damn shame so many people who should have known better gleefully engaged in demonizing her
[comment]This also wouldn't of happen if Bernie won, or Jill Stein
[comment]It still would have happened. We would have just been prepared better.
[comment]64 million people voted for her

77k in 3 states decided not to.
[comment]Trump did not vote for Iraq War like Hilary.
[comment]I hate trump more than anyone and of course any functioning adult could have done a better job but it’s unreasonable to say this wouldn’t have happened if Hillary was president.
[comment]Actually, it wouldn't have happened if the moment after Donald Trump declared he wouldn't accept a loss in 2016 because it would've been rigged, the Democrats declared the exact same thing. Especially given how it was the obvious thing to do.
[comment]Are we talking about destroying the image of the US presidency through Twitter?
[comment]Pretty sure China itself is the one to blame, if that Winnie the Pooh acted fast and didn't try to hide it.
[comment]Could we have reacted better or sooner ...yes 
But look at how many asshoels are still out there partying and ignoring rules to social distance. The other thing people don’t consider is how much this would affect the global economy. I believe that really played into how things rolled out. 

Does he lack proper grammar and speaking in full sentences. Yes

Does he contradict himself. Yes

Do people blame him for everything regardless of facts. Yes

Do people continue to share misinformation as facts yes


https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/17/instagram-posts/celebrities-are-sharing-misleading-post-about-trum/

If people could put aside their hate and look at some actually facts we might have a les polarized country. 

The guy does not speak well and is clearly a narcissist but a lot of crap he gets blamed for in just not true. 

Btw the crap the dems are jamming into this bill to pass support is a joke. Make the bill about funding. Ok they can’t agree. Then just agree to pass something but make the bill say we can change or update this in xxx days if needed. And get that crap passes.
[comment]Your right. We would have been bankrupt a lot sooner.
[comment]Hence why we need to vote for Bernie 2020 :)
[comment]oh please, it would’ve happened no matter who won. the matter of the fact is about who would’ve handled it better. 

as someone who doesn’t like Trump or Hillary, nobody would have been able to stop the spread of it completely. it’s just a matter of who would’ve delayed it better. 

trump obviously shit the bed on this one, but to say corona virus wouldn’t have happened if Hillary got elected is just blatantly wrong.
[comment]He tied to tell you idiots about it in January and even put China on a travel ban. He was then in demoncrap fashion called a racist and the ban was overturned by fascist judges. He was trying to keep it from coming here for j the first place but you idiots won’t let him do his job. Oh and thanks for stopping the stimulus package ya wankers.
[comment]Enough with the propaganda posts that keep making it to the front page without that many comments or upvotes
[comment]Yeah, well, the DNC put forward a candidate that people didn't like, and again we're not learning our lesson. Nobody wants establishment centrists.
[comment]Not sure which is more stupid, defending one of the worst nominees for president since John Kerry or pretending like Hillary's magical vagina would stop the impending doom that China's craptastic communist regime that continuously threatens the world on a yearly basis. Nothing could have stopped the incoming plague because of the blatant attempt to cover up and diagnose every person who tried to tell the world about it with the damn kung flu. Even the CDC and the WHO was underplaying this since China was giving them the okey-dokey the entire time. As for Trump allegedly firing an over bloated and over funded organization some time before this was ever even in existence, that's a load of horseshit too.

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/

Keep using those communist talking points though and sowing deceit and mistrust every where, I'm sure Democrats will eventually win an election even though that your best runner is a shadow of Obama with dementia that not even he will endorse against a full-fledged socialist.
[comment]Bernie would have won.
[comment]This wouldn’t have happened if a damn potato had won
[comment]Your right it would have been worse
[comment]9/11 would not have happened with Gore as President. 

Which would have led to not having loss of freedom over "security", no wars in Iraq/Afghanistan, (okay, the latter one might have happened under Gore, too. It was the base of al quaeda, which was probably gonna need some sort of intervention, eventually. But an intervention started, and controlled by the US, not the terrorists!) no Great recession in '08, and eventually, no Trump.

[comment]And why exactly did she lose again? Did we have a more viable alternative to Hillary?
[comment]We don't know that.

It would have happened in some form.

She is a lying corrupt piece of shit too but not on a trump level...he has his own special category.
[comment]How about the bill giving 8billion to big pharma. Still would have happend. Still corporate buy outs. About time to talk about the system not the figures.
[comment]Even I can do a better job than Trump. The worst of Democrats are better than the GOP
[comment]Let’s blame it all on Trump, because the DNC is on point.

Hey, while we’re stealing Bernies nom, let’s give it to Hillary—they were so successful last time

Calcified, dead on their feet. Trump, Hillary, Biden, the GOP, and the DNC

Old, white, 1%, conservative all of them.

Where is the real, actual left-wing? DOA, that’s where.
[comment]you can’t just epstein the virus away lol saying hillary would have saved us from a global pandemic intentionally stated by the chinese is my fav TDS of the day so thanks for that
[comment]Among so many other things that would have been better - Supreme Court Judges for one.
[comment]You don't know how she would have handled it. It's impossible to predict the future. She could have being amazing at this or even worse than Trump, but we can't know.
[comment]You lost me at “sane, sensible person.” Trump remains repugnant as ever, but Hillary is neither sane nor sensible.
[comment]Meh...I would rather have Bernie in the WH!!
[comment]I know it would be much worst. We would be in an economic mess to begin with going into this virus mess. There would be no fair trade deals. All our companies are in Europe, India, and China.  She wouldn’t have shut down the borders. She is all about embracing everyone to enter in USA.  She doesn’t care about the people but herself and how she is perceived by her party.<|endoftext|>

[comment]We should be taking notes from South Korea. Damn.
[comment]Would not trust those numbers from China, though.
[comment]China is lying
[comment]This is a stupid graph. Per capital matters, population density matters (most of our cases have come from one of the largest cities in the world with highly popular public transportation)

Now, do I think Trump did a good job - hell no.

But these graphs are just misleading.
[comment]Is this per capita? If we have 10x the population of a country we are being compared to then this is critical to account for.
[comment]Please read this understanding that these are hypothetical numbers chosen to illustrate a point about graphs and information presentation rather than argue actual infection rates. 

If country #1 has 1,000,000 residence and country #2 has 300,000,000. And country #1 had 700,000 cases and country #2 has 1.4 million cases. Who is doing the better job of containing it?

This is the flaw in the graph above. If you don't account for the population you will be led to believe that a 50% infection rate is better than a 0.4% infection rate.

Cmon guys get your head out of your ass.
[comment] Those China numbers are BS.
[comment]We aren’t testing properly, so we don’t even have accurate data. This administration is shameful.
[comment]The mayor of NYC should have told people to stock up on food and social distance rather than go on the subway and go to parades.
[comment]Adjust per capita. The numbers are meaningless otherwise.
[comment]You don't have to report cases if you're killing off your population intentionally. Looking at you, China
[comment]Should probably add up the european countries as a better proxy to compare U.S. to though.
[comment]When can we start saying “Thanks, Trump?”
[comment]Most are lying (spoiler alert) plus it's cases per million that shed more light, high school students can do a better excel sheet showing more pertinent data than this crap.

How is it logical to compare USA to any other country when it comes to population as well as overall containment? 

I get the point of the post, but this was low effort to the max. Happy quarantine and it's that damn Carol Baskin!
[comment]Be weary of any numbers from a dictatorship.  Trump "thought" he could blue sky this thing and force people to under-report the enormity and truth if this thing.  China, Iran, India, and other right wing strongman states are under-reporting and hiding numbers at the peril of the world.
[comment]Doesn't really matter which party you fall behind. The harsh truth is that us has been exposed to be unable to handle any sort of fast spreading virus, or bio warfare attack. Terrorists are licking their lips at the sight of our massive failure during something like this
[comment]I’m most curious to see what happens in Sweden. They aren’t requiring any shelter in place or social distancing.
[comment]I’m colour blind..... completely ..... graphs like this drive me nuts...

[comment]I am shocked, shocked I say! Well not that shocked.
[comment]This is totally on Trump.
[comment]Aren't the democrats the people who don't want us to have national healthcare, just so the already wealthy can profit a little bit more?
[comment]Yeah I'm gonna go with not trusting the China numbers. The entire Chinese bureaucracy is based on fudging numbers and there is no way to get an accurate estimate of their infection rate/death rate. Even if China knew the numbers, they would make sure no one else knows the numbers. 

Still, the US response or lack thereof has been an abject failure.

[comment]A few thoughts here:

1. A cumulative graph that isn't normalized is going to necessarily look worse for a large country (China notwithstanding with likely bad data.)
2. This data is 8 days old. A lot has happened since then.
3. Confirmed data is effectively meaningless since there's no consistency globally in testing per capita or even test quality. Chinese tests are notoriously bad, and some countries are testing more per capita than others (easier to roll out testing in ROK than in France.)

For all the self-hatred we have here in the US, the US is actually testing more than most of the countries on this list except for Germany and ROK, but it's simply not enough to get actual population-level data when you're at 7000 per 1m or even 10k per 1m if the testing isn't RANDOM or at least a designed sample. 

And depending on how you parse the data, the US is flattening as well:

[https://www.ft.com/\_\_origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260)

That's also clear in the daily new cases data:

[comment]This is what happenes when every first world nation has universal healthcare.  We are the most broken sespool on the planet and yall can thank republicans 100 percent
[comment]You should bear in mind that a lot more people are being tested in China than the US.
[comment]Thanks, trump
[comment]I’ve heard people criticize this for not taking population into account, but America’s population is actually not that huge, we are on the other side of the globe from the original source, we are very spread out, ales had tons of warning, and we have more money to deal with the virus than anyone else. It is still absurd and infuriating that we haven’t done better.

That is some icky phrasing.
[comment]Moderates aren’t the enemy. Obama/Biden are the ones who changed the national dialogue on healthcare and fought to expand Medicare to all ages. That’s a fact. They couldn’t get the full public option because of actual moderates, like Joe Lieberman
[comment]The article doesn't quite make this link, but the rejection of Bernie is also linked to Trump. We've already seen the insurgent candidate, the purity test, the refusing to reach out, the Hardline views without a hint of compromise. it's exactly Trump's playbook from 2016, and look how that turned out.
[comment]Then why have they been treating him as the enemy?
[comment]It's quite something to watch how the tone of the Biden and Sanders newspieces have shifted from before to after super Tuesday.
[comment]Too late to change that. Too bad.
[comment]His base just needs to vote. Talk about FDR and restoring the democratic vision. Lay off the revolution. Maybe. I dunno.
[comment]How anyone complains after what the DNC had put Bernie through,  I can't comprehend!  Lie, cheat,  steal in our faces, almost brag about out, and do anything to keep him out makes us all want to vote for him more.......JS. Keep up the free strength of his following!! :)
[comment]It will extremely hard to convince Sanders supporters to flip to Biden come the GE. Policies are so opposite. 

It’ll be really hard to be an organizer for Sanders, canvassing on policies of medicare for all, then switching to expanding the ACA (something a majority of democrats disapprove of).

[comment]About fucking time.
[comment]So, he gets impeached. Not removed. Re-Elected. 
Does some other High Crimes etc etc. Can he be impeached again (in 2nd term)?
[comment]Now the question - largely rhetorical - is whether our leaders intend to see this through, or whether they're just doing the bare minimum for plausible deniability and intend to let Republicans stop them.

Removing Donald Trump from power is not optional if this to be a free country, so none of the procedural obstacles to doing so are a rational basis for failure - they're just excuses that politicians would use if they're just posturing.

So, one of two things happens, and we know which is overwhelmingly likely: Either Donald Trump is removed from power, or there will never be a free election for President of the United States in this country again.

The fact that the impeachment charges don't include Espionage is not encouraging.  

It looks perfunctory.  

For three years, this country has not had a federal government.  Verbally acknowledging a tiny handful of the crimes committed by the insurgent regime squatting in our institutions...it's so little, and so late.

Though I'll never say "too" little or too late.
[comment]This isn't the end of the fight, it's just the beginning.
[comment]See y’all in r/drunk tonight lol
[comment]Its good that we did it but i doubt anything will happen as a result , it makes me sad
[comment]This is only the first step.

But it feels pretty damn good.
[comment]“I’m not orange, impeached”
[comment]Boo hoo hoo. Cry me a river. What a scumbag trump is. He can go eat a big bag of shit. Exactly what he deserves.
[comment]Press F to dab on the Grave of the GOP
[comment]He’s not impeached yet, lol. It has to pass the senate. Why is everyone saying he’s impeached? Wasn’t there enough “Hillary will be the next president” and “no way he could win” for y’all to be jumping the gun like this again?

Take a breath and wait for the rest of it to play out. We might not be out of this yet.
[comment]So you all must be so proud. As a Veteran who served in Afghanistan it makes me outraged that Pelosinwould even mention our service when referring to this debochal. I hope you look forward to OUR President Trump for the next term as well.
[comment]Trump 2020 here we come!!!!
[comment]Oh, the places we could go...if McConnell can't move the bills on his desk that gives us time to impeach Pence.
[comment]Yes, agree. We, I, need to do everything to ensure this isn’t an issue. 

Thanks for the info. 

GBA. (God Bless America)
[comment]A bunch of Republicans are saying we lost somehow, and that this is the destruction of our party. Even if somehow that's the case, "Strike me down in anger, and I shall grow more powerful than you could possibly imagine."
[comment]Lotta brigading here tonight.
[comment]#DumpTrump
[comment]Honestly I'll feel better when more of the people who support him within the government. At this point, the Republican Party.
[comment]"Now it goes to trial in the Senate. Now is when his true game will unfold. He let them get this far. Because now in the trial at the Senate he can subpoena each and every person testifying and force out evidence of the corruption of the very people accusing him of being corrupt. Don't let the media fool you, Trump wanted this to happen. They paint him as a fool, but in reality he has been playing them from the beginning. He knew they wouldn't stand for him winning, he knew they would come for him. But in doing so they exposed their flank, they got so caught up in their scheme to impeach him that they forgot to cover their asses and what impeachment opens up. They have just given Trump the power to expose them all."
[comment]Suck on that, Republican Traitors. You and your boy are stains on the taint of history now.
[comment]Democrats making free campaign for president Trump, you guys just ensured his victory again.
Brainlets.
[comment]Yeah and wait till it gets to the senate, y'all do know that the Senate has a Republican majority right?
[comment]Lmao, by the House ~~of Commons~~. The ~~lords~~ senate will overrule this nonsense.
[comment]Ok boomer
[comment]I will stay indepdent I don't want to be a puppet of any party and I have voted Republican at one Point and Democratic at another time.

 I just at this time don't think I could ever vote Republican again, to say that protecting Trump and his behavior in general seems like mass hypocrisy..on a value system neoconservative say we should have As Americans. 

There action seem just based on the gaining of power and money.

  Digging deep into racial fears and dviding the country like pieces of pie.

[comment]Lmao
[comment]We are now entering the most dangerous time with a mentally unstable POTUS. Vlad Putin will never have a better time to make a move than before Trump is gone and a new President is installed. Pence can't be trusted.

Thank God for Speaker Pelosi. Ever notice that Nancy Pelosi is always the smartest person in the room?

[comment]Just wait until we count up all of the mysterious pneumonia deaths in each state.
[comment]We are closing in on the number of Americans killed in WW1.
[comment]It's fine we have plenty of human capital stock. We're only cleaning out the useless ones. Or the brown ones. Or the ones that can't fight for us anymore....../s
[comment]Cue rage tweets
[comment][Much more than 100k if you consider misclassification of pneumonia deaths - link to Reddit discussion and local news article for Kentucky](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gqypwx/kentucky_has_had_913_more_pneumonia_deaths_than/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

[comment]This beginning to sound like something you'd see in an apocalypse movie
[comment]Just mind blowing that 42.7% of people think he’s doing just fine
[comment]We should see a spike again in about 2-3 weeks when the people who caught it this weekend spread spread it through the population w/o even knowing.
[comment]It passed 100k deaths about an hour ago.
[comment]Almost 2 million infections and over 100k deaths ... so much for 15cases going to 0 ... 3 months ago. SAD!
[comment]I see posts like this, then I check Instagram and see posts of people I went to high school with at a Trump boat parade.
[comment]Trump's rating is the lowest it's ever been. Imagine how easy it would have been to elect someone who would have changed something but I guess that'll have to wait another 4 years and another hundred thousand americans dead to inaction
[comment]For god sake can we just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange füher from office please
[comment]Yeah but his Kult will still support him and drink his Koolaid.
[comment]funny how democratic states are suffering worse from coronavirus... hmmmmm....
[comment]The shit will hit the fan at two million deaths. Armed insurrection at twenty million dead.

<|startoftext|>[title]81% of Americans disagree with right-wing anti-quarantine mobs
[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/4/20/21225016/protests-stay-at-home-orders-trump-conservative-group-michigan[comment]Huh.. That high..  that'd include a lot of tRumpies
[comment]What can you tell us about the 19%?
[comment]Though 100% of the 19% agree with ending immigration during this trying time
[comment]Even my dad thinks these guys are jackasses and he is a hardcore trumper.
[comment]So 19% are MAGA nuts...  I'm surprised there are that many nuts out there, but maybe most at least have a good since to stay inside and not protest.   Though them getting out they're asking to catch the virus, I really hope none of them get it.  It's like that pastor that made a big deal about defying the stay at home orders to hold church service, then he died from the virus.  I don't wish this on anyway, but if they don't stay put and abide by social distancing and wear masks it's inevitable some will get it.
[comment]These are obviously small pockets of idiots being organized by right-wing groups that are very likely organized themselves and funded by the groups working to get Trump reelected. This is a very calculated move made to cast a bad light on blue governors, considering the vast majority of the protests that have occurred at any sort of scale have been in predominantly states with a Democrat Governor and Democrat majority state congress.
[comment]&gt;Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

The idiocy of the jackass holding that sign is painful...
[comment]Haha “Give me liberty or give me Covid 19”....wow, wow, wow. What’s the logic behind their claims? Do they not care if they are infected? Do they not care if other people are infected? I can understand why they want to get out of quarantine, they want to work, just like everyone else. But considering how the situation is in the US now, it’s better for everyone to stay home.
[comment]1/5 of Americans agree with right-wing anti-quarantine mobs. thats terrifying.
[comment]Seems like the rural folks are jealous that the urban folks have all the Covid they want some for themselves. Idiots.
[comment]&gt; Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

That can be arranged.
[comment]19% is 19% more than 3 months ago. At this rate, it will be a majority by election! /s
[comment]Disagree is much too gentle. I find these people to be disgusting. They are ignorant, they are selfish, they are putting others in harms way because they've bought into right wing propaganda. I hope they are ALL held accountable to the full extent of the law. We need to make sure every one is identified and charged.
[comment]19% of Americans are fucking insane.
[comment]Trump plus Fox News are a fatal combo for these sad folk. But these actions will affect those that are following SIP, masks and distancing.
[comment]If only they couldn’t spread it to others I’d say let em die.
[comment]They are just virus vectors.
[comment]They are fake, astroturf mobs.
[comment]Fringe nuts. Every country has them unfortunately.
[comment]they're just following their god emperor's commands. I wanna see all 81% of those polled at the ballot box this november.
[comment]The “no lives matter” movement.
[comment]&gt;“You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.”

Polling around that time put Trump around 38-40% so yeah, that’s where the ~19% are from. I find comfort that they are isolating themselves from the other ~20% they need to win elections.
[comment]Protests you don’t agree with are mobs now?

Propaganda much?
[comment]But dRump agrees with them and is inciting them to continue. He is directly responsible for the second wave when it comes.
[comment]It seems like there are so many of them cause they are so LOUD. But I think most people with any brain at all get that these people are insane. I even have some hardcore trump supporters in my family who think they are being ridiculous. I am trying to bite my tongue in telling them that is how they all sound when trying to defend that monster.... lol
[comment]If they were only putting themselves in danger I’d laugh. These people are murderers
[comment]Sadly, 1 in 5 are still misguided.....I miss Barack
[comment]815 of Americans disagree with dying, hmmm
[comment]Here's what the "expert" observers are missing: Trump and his conservative backers have to do this because the total self-identified GOP base shrunk since 2016 from 29% to 24%.

In other words, he only has his core supporters (Trumpers) and his sift support from '16 left the party or left their mortal coil (+65).  

So, they are left with stunts, praying for low turnout, suppression tactics, and a narcissistic sociopath who can't shut up.  Nevermind his poor performance and where we are today.  The. GOP is effectively HIS terminal base.  The results in the 2018 Congressional, Virginia, Kentucky, and Mississippi's governor's races are bellwethers proving that.

The media is still going to sell the horserace, though.
[comment]When 81 percent of Americans agree on anything, they’re almost guaranteed to be ignored
[comment]We should issue protest permits to them but limit it to the covid critical care wards.
[comment]Assuming the ~20% are mostly Trumpy conservatives, this means that there is a relatively sizeable number of conservatives who are still reachable with logic and evidence, given the circumstances.
[comment]Phoenix these idots popped up and like in Colorado nurses showed up to counter protest. It's sad that the very people they rely on for medical care and maybe one day life saving emergency care are the one's they endanger and disrespect. Those same medical professionals will provide the care because its engrained in their DNA to help no matter who or what. Mindblowing
[comment]What about the other 19%. How was the questioned asked because I would be horrified if 19% actually believed in this.

I have not read the article yet but I’ll get to it.

Edit: just read the article and it’s 19% believed that we need less Social distancing which could just mean a slow economy which I disagree with but is better then these protesters.
[comment]that’s weird. usually the split between sane people and crazies in this country ends up being roughly 60/40
[comment]Who would have thought?
[comment]Is this really a partisan issue?
[comment]AMERICA: ONLY 19% STUPID! 

JUST GIVE US ANOTHER 236 YEARS! 

WE WILL GET THOSE PEOPLE WISED UP!
[comment]So about 70 million agree?
[comment]Conservatives are hilarious. They'll protest abortion claiming they are saving lives, but then protest quarantine measures when it's been shown shelter in place is saving lives.

I don't get it.
[comment]Only 81%?  1 in 5 Americans supports thinks epidemiology is fiction?   

Whoa boy ...
[comment]Christian ISIS? CHRISIS?
[comment]The context of the survey was:

“should continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy.”

The protesters were against the lockdown and not necessarily social distancing.  This is a blatant misinterpretation of the poll.
[comment]If I see these protestors in Albuquerque I'm going to hell shit at them.
[comment]This all illustrates sowing and reaping. The Governors who are opening too early are going to get all sorts of great results for the first three weeks and it is after that that the hospitalizations and deaths will start growing and growing. As in so many other things, what you reap comes much later than what you sow. Before reaping the Whirlwind there is often a time when stupid decisions look absolutely perfect.
[comment]Similar to 2008, a national (international) emergency of an enormous magnitude has suddenly upended the presidential race in favor of Democrats. Americans trust Democrats on healthcare far more than Republicans, it is one of the Democrats best issues - Biden, with his folksy, moderate seeming attitudes only helps. The POTUS planned to run on the economy, now collapsed, and had no plans for running on healthcare - his attempts to open the economy show the desperation to return to an economic focus. Biden's lead over Trump is now in the double-digits nationally and well into them when it comes to the Pandemic and healthcare more broadly.
[comment]They show up with guns because it helps make them appear less impotent. There should be no guns allowed at a legally organized rally. It limits those with different opinions. The students at Kent state in Ohio in 1970 didn't have guns. They weren't children like these grown men.
[comment]Boy do I live and work in the wrong place. It feels like I’m the minority.
[comment]Saw this on Twitter.  From now on they should be called the Flu Klux Klan.
[comment]Despite making up only 19% of the population, alt-right nutjobs will be responsible for 100% of the deaths from this point onwards.
[comment]The Very Loud, Very Vocal, Minority American Right.
[comment]Did you ask every 263 million Americans or is this based on a small sample of left-leaning people. No offense but just curious.
[comment]Fuck every asshole protesting quarantines
[comment]I'm so sad to admit my MIL attended one... Thank goodness for living states away
[comment]I've been reading through both what libs and cons have been saying about these protests, and I must say I've been absolutely horrified by what the (I can only hope) small libertarian part of the GOP is saying. Do you have rights? Yes you do. Are they inalienable? Yes, but again, 'Constitution is not a suicide pact.' 
I've seen so many dumbasses give some of the most braindead arguments in favor of the protest. Guess what? Theres a way for you to test the constitutional validity of what you're doing; it's called the fucking supreme court. I really hope that from the next time some dumbfuck starts on this 'freedom to protest' psychobabble, please tell them to fight it out in a court of law, rather than putting everyone's lives at risk....
[comment]you know how in Iran ppl would be paid to protest and carry Death to America signs and get free lunches so it would look like there was a mass hatred of America?  I think this is the American version of this.
[comment]It’s not a right wing protest, just pockets of idiots.
[comment]It saddens me that it’s only 81%
[comment]im pretty sure there are left-wing people who are also anti-quarantine.  Saying its only right-wing people is just pure propaganda.
[comment]Protest and die, proving Darwin right yet again...
[comment]I agree that the number is substantial, as it should be, but please God don’t use Vox as an *actual* source. It’s horseshit.
[comment]All it takes it one positive test and the health department can quarantine all of them.
[comment]That still leaves way too many people.
[comment]There are some Republican Governors and representatives doing an ok job. However they don’t have the balls to speak against trump and will pander to his rhetoric despite them secretly doing the right things as blue state governors. I am from NC and our governor is a Democrat and he is getting so much shade. I suspect though it is a vocal minority doing this. I live in the RTP and all the Republicans I know agree the state should be shut for now. They say things like we have to reopen eventually but should be shut for now. Nonetheless the mainstream GOP will pander to the organized right wing nut job organizations<|endoftext|>

I mean it's freaking sad.[comment]i will send you your merit badge in the mail.
[comment]that's the GOP for ya.
[comment]No one can stand to hear any criticism anymore.
[comment]Their ideas can't survive contact with reasonable people. 

Treat your ban like the compliment that it is.
[comment]👍🖐️✌️ to all my Democratic unknown friends out there in the Reddit world, thank you for the replies to my post. Quick story yesterday I was in a sub and there's a democratic Bernie Backer putting up posts and then I put up replies because I'm not a Bernie Backer, I am a Biden backer, we both had our back and forth and at the end of the conversation the worst it got was "we have to agree to disagree" now that's what you call a sensible conversation between 2 Democrats/people that don't agree on there potential nominees, but there's one thing about me and I hope about all the Democrats out there, I am backing whoever the nominee for the Democratic nomination is it doesn't matter, we have to get the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpf and his dictatorial administration out of office so please stay together and vote Democrat no matter who is our nominee and thanks again
[comment]I actually requested the mods ban me after I got into a good little spat on r/Republican (and they obliged me). It was liberating as I no longer attempt to squeeze any semblance of common sense out of the deplorables by using arguments that they have historically beat everyone else over the head with. TL;DR - congratulations!
[comment]It’s a cult of personality thing with Trump. It’s sort of similar with Sanders types. Any dissent is met with extreme vitriol. Fortunately, the Democratic Party has not been radicalized like the Republican Party. Big tent.
[comment]I mean all it takes is one member of the secret service who actually cares about his country and then Trump will cease to exist
[comment]I'm probably older than you but that doesn't mean anything as far as who someone votes for, I just think Joe Biden will bring people back together around this country and especially our allies but he also beats drumpf in all the poles not that I give polls too much credit anymore, also Bernie and Elizabeth Warren are, I think to left for the majority of Democrats and Republicans that will come on our side and vote with us. I'm not for Medicare for all, I'm not for free this or free that, but what I am for is, if it happens to come down to Bernie or Elizabeth Warren or any other Democrat vs this demonic entity we have in Washington you better damn well believe that I'm voting for the Democrat.
[comment]Congrats Blue Hero!
[comment]I'm banned from there and conservative too. 

I think one of them I was a bit antagonistic and kind of hostile. 

The other one I genuinely was just trying to get someone to elaborate and explain their view. I wasn't trying to troll and instigate anything. I just wanted understand why they felt the way they did and try to look at their side. 

They just threw out personal attacks at liberals and Democratic politicians and said we're/they're idiots. 

I asked again to explain again without using liberals or Democrats in their explanation and Im now banned.
[comment]you should take a peek over at r/POLITIC

it's basically T_D vs the world with no mods.
[comment]I did that a while back (on purpose) asking how if your innocent is nobody willing to testify under oath type of snarky comment. Comment removed and I had a temporary ban.
[comment]If it makes you feel better, i’ve been banned from there for a solid 6 months
[comment]I got banned from that sub for pointing out, in a completely rational tone, the fact that Trump committed bribery. So yeah, they are in fantasy land.
[comment]Never apologize.
[comment]I got permanently banned from r/politics for saying that I'd pay good money to give Junior a good slapping.

Seemed a bit arbitrary, but whatever.
[comment]I got banned for quoting Trump **verbatim**, word for word, in opposition of whatever was current party line at that time...
[comment]I was banned from a Republican group on Facebook for trying to set them straight.
[comment]Surprisingly I'm not banned despite some wholehearted attempts at it. I like to pop in there every once and a while to remind them that they're ignorant racists and cheerleading polices they jeered at when it was a democrat enacting them.

[comment]um we both have the same rules? you just broke them

[comment]Now I understand how you wrote that post about the propaganda my apologies to you sir, if you are the moderator of this room keep up the good work because you are letting people speak their mind within certain boundaries which there should be and I will do my best to stay within those boundaries I never purposely try to disrespect anybody for speaking truth and facts.
[comment]I was banned from politics for telling someone that they are a bad person for supporting Kavanaugh, which I believe.  


And from Pete Buttigieg for not thinking we should listen to neo-cons like Jen Rubin about Iraq/Iran
[comment]Figures. I’ve noticed that conservatives and republicans don’t take kindly to people having other opinions than they do. I’m fine with it. They aren’t.

In fact, just a few minutes ago somebody posted on my insta that I should leave the country because I’m a Democrat. It really shows the maturity of that while party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]The broadcast of the Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday drew 19.7 million viewers across NBC and MSNBC, making it the most-watched Democratic debate in television history, the network said
[selftext]https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/483889-nevada-democratic-debate-draws-record-breaking-197-million-viewers[comment]Good. I hope the voter turnout is bigger than ever as well.
[comment]That's great and all, but where can you watch it right now, after the fact, in full and without commentary over it?  Go try and watch it on the official NBC youtube channel, the video is 2.5 hours long, the first hour is preparatory commentary and the last hour-and-a-half is a static graphic and no sound, no debate, no content, no nothing.
[comment]It was a great debate. Glad so many tuned in. 

Klobuacher and Warren were pretty spicy. 

Bloomberg really bombed. He wasn’t well prepared for the push back and reaction from the other candidates.
[comment]I went in hoping to watch everyone take a collective shit on Bloomberg. I was not disappointed. I was also ecstatic to see Warren finally take that stick out of her ass, and proceed to beat him to death with it
[comment]Warren’s campaign should be ecstatic, she had a great performance and hopefully sees a boost in her numbers. Bernie went into the night as the front runner and his performance solidified that. Amy and Pete are fighting for the moderate spot and hoping Joe just crash and burns. Bloomberg left in a body bag, and it was awesome to watch.
[comment]I watched mostly to see Warren hammer the new york pork dork
[comment]Question from a foreigner: What is the fanfare/anthem played in the introductiom and during breaks? I hear it being played on podcasts about politics too when they are discussing the primaries.
[comment]Any explanation why? 

All the other debates have been steady decreases and lows for Democratic debates, most averaging around 6.5 mil if I remember correctly?

Did this many people tune in for Bloomberg or did they just tune in after hearing a billionaire was getting roasted on national television? 

So interesting
[comment]It was a snuff film, I can't see Bloomberg coming back to life after that showing.
[comment]If I'm Warren, and to a lesser degree Biden, this is great news.
[comment]Do us that number include streaming?
[comment]That kind of surprises me.  There's no one who's really caught on and stood out as the frontrunner, but maybe that's why, because so many people need to make a decision.
[comment]How do I watch it now?
[comment]"According to these numbers we have, which were created by our own company, about our own company's product, this was the Greatest Show on Earth!"

-Seriously, though, I felt like I was watching a highly scripted WWE performance.
[comment]So 9.7 million people watched Bloomberg get his ass handed to him?
[comment]Big night for Warren, Pete, Biden

Bernie got hit hard for the first time of his life but maintains his lead. 

Bloomberg cannot purchase a better reputation so he’s not really a viable candidate anymore. I really, really hope his following dies. 

Klobuchar cannot outflank Buttigieg or Biden, she’s simply going to run out of money - soon. The more she tries to make it look like she’s punching down on Pete the worse she looks.
[comment]A big part of this was curiosity about the billionaire who had bought his way onstage. And I'm very glad to know that 20 million people watched him be eviscerated by Warren.
[comment]They were all fighting each other. I don’t think I like any of them if they can’t stop
[comment]Shout out to Tom Perez, who took a ton of flak for adjusting the requirements that put Bloomberg into the debate instead of letting him hide behind TV ads where nobody could criticize him to his face. Bloomberg was polling too well not to be vetted and he was vetted in spectacular fashion. Everyone who was criticizing Perez should realize he knew this was going to happen all along.
[comment]Warren does so well with these things.  She eviscerated Bloomberg rather cleanly.
[comment]Of all the ones to be most watched, yikes!
[comment]It’s pretty blatantly obvious after watching the “replays” NBC and MSNBC are posting, that they want to minimize the damage done to ol’ NY Fuckface because ALL audience reactions are entirely cut short. I cannot find a replay in it’s entirety. Anyone have a link?
[comment]Does anyone else find Pete super smug? I want to like him but I just can’t the more I actually watch him. He speaks eloquently sure but I just find him giving off such smug vibes. Which seems weird because he has such little experience. Is it just me?
[comment]What a disgrace. Warren and Kolbawhatever should take a piss and fuck off. Pete should go back to his village. Bloomberg should learn how to speak. Biden sounds too desperate. 40 years in Government nothing happened. Tell him to go fuck Thomas in the Supreme Court as he was a disgrace in the senate the way he behaved with dr. Hill. Sander should go past fucking sound bites. I am ashamed to be a democratic.
[comment]The networks should be basically only broadcasting these debates on these days. Regularly scheduled programming is halted for the SOTU address, for baseball games and other things many of which are also unnecessary. They should be halting regular programming so that everyone is watching this and can actually make decisions that are informed by what they have seen and heard for themselves, not by the blatant partisan and biased views of the networks.
[comment]Lies, I watched, nothing historical about it
[comment]Why is Bloomberg there?

How did he possibly qualify after joining late and ...No on liking him???

Was he any good? On Colbert he came across as just unnecessary and insincere and weak.
[comment]That’s great news.  Now, DNC, don’t fuck it up this time.
[comment]I thought it was really good.  They got out all of the issues on people's mind about each candidate and they debated it.  Hopefully, they also got rid of Bloomberg too.  Warren demonstrated what a Trump Lite he is..Bloomberg hoeing humming about releasing his taxes(just like Trump)...Warren ain't having that either. "Do the work. Get it done!" LOL "And release the women who you have under non-disclosure for sexual harassment etc so they can speak and tell us their side of the story...rich men have tried to muzzled women for years and that is NOT what this party is about!" MY THOUGHTS: No one becomes a billionaire without compromising on morals/dirty or questionable dealings. 9 Million+ lobbying for his company's benefit. Bloomberg paid slave wages and bought off sexual harassment/discrimination cases to make his fortune. Bloomberg has long opposed financial regulations and raised money for Tom DeLay, the Republican former House majority leader who was convicted on money laundering charges in 2010. Additionally, as mayor(which he bought his way into)and numerous other republicans.

He is conveniently a republican when it suits him..Bloomberg supported the police department’s “stop-and-frisk” policy that disproportionately targeted minority men. Makes racist comments almost as often as Trump. And for whatever reason he denies the scientific and economic benefits of legalized marijuana.. Apparently, he doesn't even know what a transgender person is let alone how to provide justice and equity for them. I'm sure he has a ton of baggage we haven't heard about but sorry I want a true public servant, not a billionaire playing at being one.
[comment]Wow! Everyone really got to see their favorite politicians in action!
[comment]Yeah, I think Cortez could be powerful in the senate as a majority/ minority leader. Somehow I see her getting the whip on other congressmen and congresswomen. Only time will tell.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Election Day should be a day off work nationwide.
[comment]Dem governors in swing states need to do this to drive turnout to defeat trump good job
[comment]Dont call it a comeback.
[comment]So you’re saying a guy from the South, who grew up 40 years ago, and was in a jokey black face picture, can actually accomplish great things, for black people and progressives, if he isn’t a victim of progressive cancel culture?
[comment]What are the benefits of eliminating voter ID?
[comment]This man just eliminated any chance of Republicans winning elections in Virginia again.
[comment]According to Republicans this is cheating.
[comment]👍👍👍👍👍👍
[comment]Is this feasible to expand to other Southern states?  I'm campaigning for a seat in the Georgia General Assembly.  Is this a top-level issue that would resonate with Georgia voters?  (Right under healthcare, obviously.)
[comment]Why are voting rights a partisan issue? Furthermore, why are Republicans ok with being on the OTHER SIDE?
[comment]Bam!     Take that you cheatin sneakin Repubs!
[comment]How do you only vote once without an id?
[comment]More demonrat policy eroding our democracy.
[comment]Well we in Washington are better than everyone else as we don't need a day to vote.  We get out ballot in the mail when we're registered and have around a MONTH to mail it in free or drop it off in a secured ballot box.. thus eliminating the need for volunteering at polling places, poll watchers, traffic, lines, worrying about voter ID...and this is coming from a conservative whose lived here for 2 years now up from the Deep South..aka...assbackwardsville.
[comment]There's some republicans with frosty balls in VA right now. Prep for the retaliation.
[comment]I live in Las Vegas but should vote in Virginia just to prove how stupid it is not to require an ID to vote. Do I love in Virginia? Oh of course I do, I’ve been living here my whole life? ID? No I don’t have any ID, I live in Alexandria, yea, that’s the ticket! I live on Broadway, yea, that’s the street! Can I have my ballot now?
[comment]I don't understand why we would eliminate voter ID instead of just providing everyone a free and easy way to acquire ID. There is no way that "no ID no problem!" is the perfect solution.
[comment]Bad news for Republicans,  good news for all of Virginia.
[comment]Uh huh. Where's the mail in ballot? Been doing it forever in Washington. Get with it.
[comment]It's crazy that this is a partisan issue
[comment]Love.
[comment]This is the way.
[comment]They as in the dirty ass Republicans will never make this a holiday because they know more people come out on the Democratic side than the Republican side and they would get their asses beat, just like what's going to happen in November!!
[comment]Amazing news. We’re going to hold Virginia now. Hopefully this will work towards eliminating other Republican holdouts across the state.

[comment]That was "get fucked" in political speak
[comment]What a scumbag completely dodged the question. He knows hes guilty they asked about your SON!! Of course your tax returns are clean
[comment]If Hunter did something wrong prosecute his ass. Meanwhile Trump's kids sit in the White House grifting millions. Sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.
[comment]Doesn’t it seem odd that this is the second heckler in about a week for Biden?  Is it all a production?
[comment]Can we not bury our heads in the sand and pretend Biden didn't potentially have equally dirty dealings in Ukraine.
[comment]It would be nice to have a representative that doesn't ingratiate himself or herself. Where can we find one of those?
[comment]Mic drop!
[comment]This is good because it works for either Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.  The only 2 people running in 2020 who haven't released their tax returns, and who have supporters that spend all day heckling candidates at their town halls.
[comment]The media keeps allowing this "whataboutism" to continue.  The answer every time needs to be, "There has been no wrong doing by Hunter Biden. If they wish to investigate him, they can do that, it has nothing to do with Trump's abuse of power and cover up."
[comment]It’s insane how partisan this whole topic is. Is there no one else that believes it unethical and immoral for members of either party and their families to be profiteering off of their government  offices? 

It’s wrong. It doesn’t matter if there is a R or D behind your name.
[comment]But but....Hillary's emails. Benghazi.
[comment]Aw the good ol move the goalposts
[comment]Solid response
[comment]I'm confused, if someone doesn't like Biden then they automatically like Trump? Is that the only options there are? Where does that leave me? Because I don't like Biden and despise Trump. Guess I don't exist.
[comment]Ah yes taxes the thing no rich person has ever lied about ever
[comment]It blows my mind that Trump supporters stopped caring about his tax returns.

Our President fucking promised us something 4 years ago, and now he is literally fighting  in the courts tooth and nail to renig on that promise, right in front of us! It's really offensive to our intelligence
[comment]The presidency is in the mud and joe decided to join him.
[comment]Biden's treating this story the same way Hillary treated the email story.  Better to just come clean and get it over with, get it behind you instead of keeping it in the news.  What is it with these old Dems just completely incapable of admitting something they did seemed shitty and pledging to do better?
[comment]That's deflecting the question however
[comment]That's a non answer lolololol
[comment]Imagine believing that if people don't support you they de facto support Trump... Joe Biden's gross and if we give him the nomination we'll lose the election.
[comment]Heh, no wonder trump is already trying to [back out of debates](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2019/12/trump-may-skip-2020-debates-concerned-about-moderators.html). 2020 is going to be hilarious.
[comment]Just throwing this out there. What if Biden came out and agreed to testify, in exchange for Trump agreeing to do the same?
[comment]And please notice that the hecklers were not thrown out, as Trump did to the ones at his rally. Who is the fascist now?
[comment]I’m sorry but I’m what world is hedging a question admirable?
[comment]Lol, got to love joe. 

If biden's son did soemthing, he would have been in front of congress 3 years ago with hillary. 

And both would be in jail. 

Yet all the gop has now is "what exactly happened in the Ukraine?" Which means either they have done zero investigations and are incompetent, or did the investigations, found nothing, and just want to pretend they didn't and don't have a clue.
[comment]👏👏👏👏👏 Go Joe!
[comment]Forget about his filthy ass daughter/sons/family what about the bitch himself Donald j drumpf, not having and or releasing any transcripts from 5 meetings with the freaking dictator of Russia? and ordering his interpreter to destroy all the notes from said meetings what about the meetings with the scumbags from Saudi Arabia and the scumbag from Turkey, now that's fucking dirty and that's why he's a dirty rotten (possible traitor)national security risk.

Me, after winning the lotto tomorrow and putting it all in index funds: "American's have a constitutional right to assemble, worship God, and shoot guns at the same time."
[comment]Is he even offering any policy? Or is he just going to keep spouting rhetoric and platitudes?
[comment]Tell that to the million Iraqis you helped kill, fucking hypocrite!
[comment]Wow, Joe is so brave!
[comment]In other news, terrorism is bad and airplanes fly fast.
[comment]Did he really say all that without bumbling his words?
[comment]Wow, I thought Joe disappeared after the last debate.  Good to know a few weeks after the outbreak and after Bernie raised millions in relief that Joe feels that we shouldn't just allow citizens to die.  What a bold and courageous statement Joe!  I'm sure neo-liberals feel the same way.
[comment]Trump: "We should be prepared to let a lot of seniors die to save our economy."

Biden: "We should **not** do that."

Everyone: "I just *don't know who to vote for!*"

[comment]He didnt mention job.  Let's face it. Some of us are being considered expendable.  My factory is still working building battery test systems.  Grocers gas station attendants and other low wage people who cant afford to voluntarily stay home are being forced to risk themselves and their families with 0 additional compensation. None of us have any hope that we will be remembered when this is done. We are not getting hazard pay and very few companies are offering us anything more than work your shitty job twice as hard for the same pay with more risk.  We cant just go get new jobs. We are stuck and we are being taken advantage of.  While most of the world is relaxing at home we are hurting ourselves for you. It's great that the govs are putting out stimulus checks and paying for up to 90%of companies salaries.  Bailouts for companies who used their cash reserves to buy back stock instead of taking care of its worker.  Every one of us that works at this level understands something a lot of the people making decisions dont seem to get.  They can always replace us.  Always. There will always be someone out there in a worse position. So they will  agree to anything in hope's of taking one more step up. There are plenty of memes saying thank you.  But tbh that doesnt do shit for any of us.  Your thank yous dont pay for my food or rent.  Your thank yous do not get us the ppe we need to stay safe. We keep working while you cry about staying home.. do you have any idea how much we would like to have a 2 week vacation at home?  We are the people least likely to have ever had such time off yet we are the ones being pushed to keep working.  We are looked down on and paid shit every day now all the sudden we are " essential "
[comment]Then support m4a or your words are meaningless.
[comment]I agree.  I saw Sanders say the same many times recently.

But where has joe been? I even heard a rumour he has the virus and is gravely ill.   I would hope if he plans on being president he embraces Medicare for all as this crisis is showing the true cost of care and the division in America the wealth divide creates.
[comment]Was this tweeted from behind a podium in his living room
[comment]As a current registered Democrat, I much prefer Bernie Sanders's proactive response to the crisis. I am glad Joe Biden has finally spoken up. I'm also glad the Joe Biden had decided to follow Bernie Sanders' leadership which has been primarily focused on, We The People. :-)
[comment]Biden needs to be doing a daily briefing- He and Cuomo should basically take over the job Trump isn't doing and just do it.
[comment]Let me be very clear: The coronavirus is a bad thing.
[comment]Oh I don't know, we could stand to lose Trump...
[comment]Well Joe, that's not how capitalism works. The whole point of the system is that workers are expendable.
[comment]How amazing is it that this has to be said?
[comment]Anyone else sick of them starting every statement with LMBVC
[comment]Too bad all Trump cares about is his reelection and the stock market! He knew about this from intelligence months ago and did nothing!
If anyone else with a soul was running the country and felt the way Joe does,  the situation would not be as bad as this. And THEY would not have turned down the test kits from the World Health Organisation so we could test far more people to help contain this virus. I wish someone could find a way to shut Trump up and stop his constant lies!
[comment]This sounds great.  Now SHOW me you mean it.
[comment]wow...so brave....where does he find the courage?
[comment]Mad King Trump is probably expendable.
[comment]It’s funny that Ive heard Bernie so much in the last few weeks that he almost starting to get on my nerves, but the first thing that Biden says (and he’s just repeating what Cuomo said the other day) gets posted like he’s the perfect person to take over the presidency.

[comment]I love Transformers. You twist them around and they become another thing. We got a Has-bro now and us Bernie-Bros are kicked to the curb like old toys. Yea, we were played. And I don't feel excited by our chances.
Thing is, Bernie was Optimus Prime, Biden is BabbleBee and Trump is a DeceptiCon. 
Bernie started the transfer, talked of rebuilding. And he worked tirelessly for "US". With empathy and integrity.
Biden walks in off of Obama coattails with no inspiration or grassroots following, then expects us to come together now. What a easy ride. It's all vote blue no matter who now. Sure I'll vote for you, but it sure doesn't feel like "US" anymore to me.
[comment]Gee, that's so inspiring. Or something.
[comment]Biden literally is the system.  Trump bad, fine, but Biden was practically born in a committee hearing.  I mean he was elected as a 29 year old and now he’s damn near 80!
[comment]My grandpa who is a conservative Turkish immigrant to the US told me this today " The Democrats build and then the Bush and the Trumps republicans ruin it" I never thought I'd hear something like that from him. He always votes for Erdogan in Turkey who is no different than Trump so I thought he'd support Trump. But like my grandpa always says, vote for the best of the two evils and I guess that is Biden. To the Bernie supporters out there, Bernie was the flame that ignited many feelings and ideas. Survive to thrive another day I guess.
[comment]Transform in what way? I'll fight for Biden over Trump and Democrats all the way down the line, but I have not heard one single transformative idea from Biden besides having a president who not Trump.
[comment]💎JOE🇺🇸
[comment]I'm not super excited but I'll vote for turd sandwich over giant douche with zero reservations.

[comment]Biden wasn’t my first choice but he’ll damn sure get my vote in November.
[comment]Announce bernie as VP so reddit can calm tf down
[comment]This is a Democratic Party sub. The primary is now over. We’re all pouring our resources into helping the Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden win the general election against the Republican incumbent President Donald Trump.

Welcome everyone! Good luck in November!

Edit: Replaced my unhelpful ending
[comment]Blue no matter who.
[comment]Joe should pick AOC as his running mate.  I know they probably don't see eye to eye on a lot, but it would really help bridge the gap with those bernie supporters. Without those bernie bros, he aint winning jack shit.

[comment]Bloomberg would love nothing more than 4 more years of Trump. All of these shitty billionaires do. 

Tax the fuck out of them all.
[comment]He's going to get Bernie elected
[comment]Yep, think about please!!
[comment]never say never...who really thought the idiot in the white house would win?
[comment]As he is a billionaire, Trump winning would only help himself.  I am sure this is just a stunt to just add chaos to the Democratic party.
[comment]Just vote and get everyone you know to vote too.
[comment]Bloombergs goal isn't to elect Trump, but it is to prevent Bernie from being elected. Which is the same as working to elect Trump. Bloomie and the other billionaires are willing to flush the whole country down the tubes rather than pay some taxes.
[comment]The same could be said if Warren and Sanders. Just don’t think their policies are what the majority of Americans want. Biden still stands the best chance to defeat Trump,
[comment]The only spoiler Bloomberg will play is Biden's. He's going to hand the nomination to Sanders or Warren, and then as a desperate attempt to save his own ass he will run as an independent and I'm not so sure a billionaire is going to spoil anything for today's left.
[comment]I think that informing people about Bloomberg's policy positions will actually help Democrats. It would cause disaffected Republicans to vote for Bloomberg. The Democratic party voters have no love for that guy.
[comment]Im pretty sure thats why he entered the election
[comment]Boomerberg running for president just solidifies for me that he prefers Trump over Bernie or Warren because both would make him pay more in taxes.
[comment]I just saw a tv ad for this guy, made it seem like he will house all the homeless and get rid of guns. And he has an image of trump with a very tepid anti-endorsement. This is bad.
[comment]I hate to be a conspiracy theorist but he was on Anderson's cooper a while back and volunteered he had met with Epstien. Anderson didn't even ask. The presidency is the new get of jail free card.
[comment]I am not a fan of Bloomberg at all, but it may be part of the plan. Because let’s be honest, I honestly don’t see a potential democratic candidate that would beat Trump. But it’s still early and a lot can change, only time will tell.
[comment]During this next election, anyone who does not vote for the Democratic nominee, will essentially be voting for Trump - regardless of whether they vote for Trump directly or not.
[comment]This guy needs to stop invoking 9/11 in his obnoxious Youtube ads.  He's acting like Giuliani.
[comment]It's interesting that he doesn't even have to directly support Trump to support Trump. Just by buying up advertisement slots, he can give his side the edge.<|endoftext|>

[comment]They're either very low intelligence, completely out of touch with reality, or have a cruel streak in some way... sometimes all three.
[comment]Who wants to date someone with the emotional intelligence of a 5 year old?
[comment]trumpism is a damn fine indicator of a serious lack of rationality.
[comment]I find it difficult to not punch them in the face. And 3/4 seems low to me. The 1/4 must be the dumbdems that voted for Biden, or would fuck a Repub if he had money.
[comment]I started chatting with one once... second question she asked me was if I supported the orange racist.  Said yes (I don’t)  

Was some of the most awful hatred I’d ever seen anyone text.  Just kept pushing to see how much more I could get out of her.  In then end I actually felt bad for her.  Said Obama was the best president ever and told her to have a great day

The absolute horror texts I got after that were hilarious
[comment]Have you spoken to any of them? Can't imagine having to sit through a couple of hours.
[comment]I think women like bad boys, not stupid boys.
[comment]True story: I dated a trump supporter ONCE, and only because I had never asked him of his political leanings before becoming involved with him. He broke up with me after 3 months because he found out I had a black boyfriend in middle school. 

I am truly stunned there even exists a 25% that would consider dating these people.
[comment]These are rookie numbers people, let's make that one of the first questions we ask from now on.
[comment]Reminds me of the interviews in Behind the Curve documentary about flat earthers where they talk about people dumping them or not going on another date  after finding out they're a flat earther.
[comment]Only three quarters?
[comment]I already get enough racism and xenophobia from my relatives. Don’t need that shit from a SO.
[comment]One-quarter of single Democrats are truly desperate, survey finds.
[comment]And the other quarter think they can fix him or her.
[comment]I mean I’m sure the feeling is mutual.
[comment]Embarrassingly, I dated a rich Trump supporter. I’ll resist sharing details about her, but I will say that I will never make such a mistake again.
[comment]Because who would want to date someone who is bigoted and/or ignorant and/or plain stupid and/or uninformed? There’s a slim chance they’re uninformed and then you can educate them, but that’s rare in my experience.
[comment]Damn right. Can't even picture it.
[comment]Im not attracted to idiots either
[comment]It ends up in unhealthy territory.

You end up feeling like you have to save her.  Or else getting into some dark shit where you're willing to be a slave to her.

The Carver/Matlin thing only exists because neither of them actually believe in anything.
[comment]I don't think I should date at all because physical contact makes me uncomfortable and I like my time to myself too much, but if I did date, I definitely would not date a Trump supporter.  I find it hard to even be friends with Trump supporters.
[comment]I’d fuck one as hard as I could out of spite lmao
[comment]The real question is what percentage of democrats would date someone that didnt vote in 2016. Cause they lowkey voted for Trump too, and will claim up and down that they didnt.
[comment]Ugh! Ex girlfriend was a republican and thought Nixon was framed and given a raw deal. Why I hung in there for the next 6 months baffles me but breaking up was a little bit easier due to a lack of compatibility.
[comment]I stop talking to them when I find out.
[comment]I was looking at the numbers closely and what stands out is that less than college educated democrats were more likely to date a Republican, it would have been nice to see the ages. Possibly younger people just don’t think more about the significance of dating someone with shared interests, it seems to be one of those life lesson things. 

Something else that stood out at me is the number of Democrats who would not date a Hillary Clinton voter, I don’t mean any disrespect but is this the Bernie corner? What caused this?
[comment]Buncha incels
[comment]Very tolerant
[comment]Democrats have morals.
[comment]That’s embarrassing
[comment]I started dating a trump supporter back in April 2018. We are still together, but now he is a registered Democrat and cast his vote for Biden in the primary and plans on doing it again in November. 

Not all Trump supporters are beyond help.
[comment]I'm always torn about things like this as I consider turn-about to be fair play.  


I tell myself that we shouldn't expect or extend fair play rules to literal nazis, but then I worry because I know they view us the same way.  


This situation sucks.
[comment]I’m a liberal currently dating a trump supporter. Can confirm it is very hard to even mention the current state of the world. Love her dearly though.
[comment]They are between the levels of dumb too batshit crazy. Why would someone sane want that?
[comment]Of course. Total red flag.
[comment]I wanted to say that being a Trump supporter is sorta like being an incel, except it's entirely voluntary.
[comment]If this is your biggest concern, then you probably aren’t mature enough for a serious relationship. 

I’m going to go against the flow here, but I’ve noticed that a lot of these comments are from single people, like the survey. It needs to be said: get off reddit, take a break from social media (especially political twitter). Get some fresh air and make some human connections. You’ll find that politics, especially partisan politics, is a lot less important than it seems when you choose to immerse yourself in it 24/7.

[comment]I’m a gay man.  One of my coworkers wanted to set me up with a friend of hers.  She showed me some pics; good-looking guy.  Then she told me he’s a conservative Republican and I was like “no thanks, you can stop there.”  I’ve never understood how anyone LGBT can be politically conservative, especially in the current climate.
[comment]The other 25% are very drunk.
[comment]You guys do know that there is a massive difference between Trump voters and Trump supporters, right? Some people grudgingly voted for him maybe cause they were lifelong Republican's, maybe because they had been fed a lie (MidWest/Rust belt, blue collar workers) about bringing their jobs back, or maybe because they were skeptical of Hillary over the email scandal. While yes, he has his evangelical racist base, not all of his VOTERS are racist. If you dismiss them as racist, how do you guys ever expect to win back those swing states again? Sure, of course there are the too far gonners, but at the same time, there are also those who saw Trump as a way out, a chance to get their jobs back (even though he resultantly didn't ever do that) But seriously, how ignorant are you to not hear the story of a Trump voter before you make your ultimatum?
[comment]I'd be down for one date. Wouldn't mind seeing where we'd go. If he did any moves tho...
[comment]The same democrats who voted biden into the nomination. And don't come with least he's not as bad as trump. It's like offering stage 1 cancer vs stage 3 cancer. Yeah one is worse but its still cancer.
[comment]Dem/progressive women start off calling you an asshole, bigot etc. then when they calm down and you talk for another 20 minutes they end up sucking you off cause you aren’t a sissy boy yes man
[comment]how relevant
[comment]Why would they want to date an 80-year-old anyway?
[comment]It's called natural selection.
[comment]Why would I date someone so hateful and brainwashed?
[comment]Do you honestly think that a trump supporter would even want to date an opinionated, bigoted, purple-haired, pierced woman with poor hygiene??

Really?
[comment]Won’t DATE?! Hell, I won’t even talk to them any more.
[comment]My in laws are on the opposite sides of things and they don't talk about politics.

But, I do have relatives that will outright say if you are a democrat you are a traitor. Those types are hard to relax around because you can't relax around someone that effectively wants you dead.
[comment]Yeah Hot but crazy, been there done that. I'm looking for attractive enough and logical (single forever.)
[comment]I won't even be friends with Trump supporters. I'm cutting ties with all  but the closest family, if they are Trump supporters.
[comment]The other 1/4 are 16 and under. Right? Please?
[comment]Did it once...never again!
[comment]It's hard enough to get along with Trumpified relatives.
[comment]my girlfriend wouldnt, thats why im an “independent”
[comment]Usually blatant stupidity is a turn off so this is not surprising
[comment]This is why in each and every relationship that makes it past the third date mark, I talk politics. And not just "hey the city council wants to fix the local park's swings"....but the big stuff. M4A, Citizen United, abortion, immigration, legalization of marijuana, etc. It may be "assholish" of me, but some beliefs I just can't compromise away.
[comment]I have disowned Trumpers. I would like to see the stats on that.
[comment]I don’t hate Republicans, but I hate Trump supporters with an passion.
[comment]My younger brother voted for Trump. Not because he supported him, but to cancel *my* vote.

I haven't spoken to him in three years.
[comment]That’s because, with Trump supporters, it’s not a difference in political stances. It’s a difference in morality. A compatible relationship requires comparable morals and ethics.
[comment]20 years ago I was a Republican who dated a Democrat. Haven’t voted Republican since the 2000 Primary when my girlfriend convinced me that “even Gore” would better than Bush Jr. 

Sometimes you meet someone hot enough to make you question your values.
[comment]I'd rather have a boil implant at to date a MAGA virus.
[comment]So, you have no compassion and you can't plan long term. Nope.
[comment]But female Trump supporters are easy, and they settle.
[comment]I wouldnt...
[comment]Who the fuck pays for this nonsense? Surveys take a lot of time and money and someone thought this was worth both?
[comment]Not surprised
[comment]Sympatric speciation
[comment]If I was single I'd date a Trump supporter.

I've always wondered what it would be like to be the smartest person in the relationship.
[comment]Just being in the vicinity of a tRump supporter is reprehensible.
[comment]My grandma is a democrat an my grandpa is a trump voter but he’s at least not racist or sexist or homophobic. I bet they have a fun time at the polling booth
[comment]You are essentially saying you'd date someone who is ok being a racist, misogynist who is a pathological liar. Yeah, let's go on a date. Bring your red hat. 1/4 of less crazy people are still crazy.
[comment]Hell no 👎
[comment]Dating mentally challenged people seems problematic
[comment]Can't fix stupid, so why date one?
[comment]What’s wrong with the other 25%?
[comment]Especially now, with the protests it's a good bet they got the Rona.
[comment]I wouldn't even date someone who didn't fully participate in Democratic Party activities and work on campaigns with me.
[comment]If you have to draw the line at political preference, you shouldn’t be dating.

You should have an open mind that isn’t based on who they voted for. 

In my eyes, it’s like an atheist and a Christian: you might not believe the same things, but you don’t have to bring it up all the time, that just leads to arguments. And there are 1000s of times where those relationships worked out.
[comment]Yup, more liberal tolerance and love of diversity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Your vote in November will likely decide who Ruth Bader Ginsburg's successor will be on the Supreme Court. If you want that successor to be a progressive, Biden's the only choice.
[selftext]If DT chooses the next Supreme Court judge, likely she will be a puppet of the president supporting unfair gerrymandering,  election laws and crushing the pro-choice movement.   If we get 4 more  years , there will be no stopping him with full control of the senate,  the Supreme Court and the WH.   Even if Dems hold onto the House, the  Senate and the Supreme Court are much more powerful.  The rise of  totalitarianism in the United States[comment]https://i.redd.it/5mt9d4t7n2s41.png
[comment]Hold me hostage I love it.
[comment]Support the Senate candidates in contested races as well. Biden can prevent another right wing judge but he can’t seat any judges without Senate confirmation. 

McConnell has already shown he’d rather leave those positions vacant than allow any Democratic nominee to be confirmed.
[comment]I do not like biden....but..RBG is the uber important...I will swallow pride and bite my tongue off but no Republicans will get my vote
[comment]No.
[comment]Are democrats calling themselves progressives now?
[comment]The next Supreme Court Justice to be replaced could be could be RBG or Thomas, Alito, or any of them. Be sure we have the best person to choose their successor.
[comment]The Supreme Court has to be secured PERIOD!!!
[comment]I can hear the gun pointed at my head being cocked.
[comment]The Supreme court has been a conservative majority since the 1970s. 

Garland/Gorsuch was the first opportunity in all that time to flip it liberal. 

If Trump gets 4 more years, he will replace 2 more judges (RBG being one, and most likely Thomas), but also probably Breyer. 

Having a 6-3 conservative majority, filled to the brim with young judges, is an absolute disaster. 

If you want ANY, and I mean ANY of your liberal ideals to survive a court challenge in the next 30 years, bite your tongue, swallow your pride, and vote Biden. 

Vote Biden, because he isn't Trump. And removing Trump from office is of a HUGE importance.

Also, make no mistake. There is a mile of difference in policy between Biden and Trump, even if Biden isn't as liberal as you want him to be.
[comment]Let RBG retire already!!!!
[comment]The DNC/Biden better start finding ways to earn independent/swing votes then. If they can't do this, it's not the voter's fault they failed to expand their base. 

They need to start figuring out how to appeal to young voters and to Bernie's supporters. Polls are saying that Biden/Trump are tied at 44% of young voters, how is that even possible that they're tired? I get it that a lot of young voters don't vote but a good size does, those need a reason to vote Democrat/Biden.

Also, I see a lot of blame coming from all sides, but we have to remember that the only power or voice the people have is their vote. However you choose to see it, whether it's not voting or always voting red/blue you're wasting your vote if you're not voting for a person that's speaking to your concerns then you're wasting your only voice if you're simply falling in line. This concept can't be changed.

You can't expect people to vote for your values. People need to find their own values to vote for, that's the whole point of having your own vote to cast. If you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is saying that Biden isn't speaking to their concerns, why would I vote for him? Then tell them "What about the SCOTUS??, there are other more important things than your concerns"...

You're basically telling these people their main concerns don't matter. Imagine being told that your concern over the SCOTUS doesn't matter because surviving day to day matters more? How would you react to that? We can't guilt or force people to prioritize each other's own personal values. To you, the SCOTUS matters the most and to others, the basic necessities matter the most. 

So pitting people against each other saying that this matters more isn't going to work or speak to the voters you need.
[comment]The next president (be that Biden or a second term for Trump) will likely appoint anywhere from 1-4 justices:

* RBG (89, liberal bloc, Clinton appointee)
* Breyer (81, liberal bloc, Clinton appointee)
* Thomas (71, conservative bloc, H.W. Bush appointee)
* Alito (70, conservative bloc, W. Bush appointee)

If we win the WH and the Senate, we will, at a minimum, ensure that the current balance of the Court remains only a narrow 5-4 conservative majority, with the *possibility* of flipping the Court to a 6-3 liberal majority if Thomas and Alito also retire and/or die during the next 4 years.

If Trump and the GOP maintain power, then the Court will be lost for a generation, with a high likelihood of an 7-2 conservative majority (plus Thomas and Alito would likely be pressured to retire to be replaced with younger conservatives to lock in their majority even longer).

We can’t let that happen.
[comment]Biden is extremely electable, and Trump is so hated that he’s *definitely* going to lose—or at least that’s what the DNC has been telling us. 

I trust them, so I know I’m safe to vote my conscience on Election Day, so that my voice can be heard of even in some small way.
[comment]So, why would the Democratic Party start a civil war on their own side? Weird strategy if there is an existential threat.
[comment]The Supreme Court is already conservative and joe Biden is also a conservative. Who cares, the fight is long, don’t vote for the democrats hostage plan. They will never learn, so they must be destroyed.
[comment]Thank you. I’ve been trying to tell some of the Bernie bro children this, but apparently I’m “pathetic with no morality”.
[comment]1. RBG needs to survive until Inauguration day
2. Lets hope the Donald doesn't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay or even cancel the general election.
[comment]He isn't the only choice. Biden can step down and a more viable candidate chosen at the convention. A lot of Bernie supporters are independent and Republicans mad at Trump. Biden absolutely can not get any of their votes. Trumps campaign is already bringing up bidens dixiecrat roots.

Democrats kept saying Bernie couldn't build a coalition, but Biden can't get independents, 3rd parties, and Republicans to flip. Trump is guaranteed to win with democrats running Biden and having attacked Bernie so much. If it's bloomberg Biden Clinton, Trump wins hands down. This time both the college and popular vote. Woman are going to abandon the democrats once all the biden kid touching and rape allegations start to come out.
[comment]Only if we also win the senate.

Otherwise, the Turtle will block a blue nominee for eight years if he must.
[comment]The DNC is counting on people falling in line with its candidate choice. 

Like our corporate CEOs should be learning right now (but they aren’t, thanks to bailouts) if you risk big you can lose big
[comment]Wasn’t Obama’s pick Merrick Garland... and wasn’t he conservative? And what about the Anita Hill situation?
[comment]Tried that argument in 2016 when three judges were in play (well done RBG for hanging in there for us) but the Bernie fundamentalists would have nothing of it. I came to the conclusion that most of them wouldn't have voted anyway which was somewhat confirmed in the primaries. All principles no action. 

My take - it's far easier to change from a position of power when you don't have a boot on your neck and a baton beating your balls (or whatever if you don't have them). Unless of course you prefer a bloody revolution and I see zero evidence that more than a tiny handful of Biden refuseniks are into that. You can't have a revolution by just liking social media posts really enthusiastically.
[comment]Biden voted for Scalia
[comment]Should have retired literally anytime between 08-16. Hubris got us in this mess.
[comment]Not without Senate. Not voting for Biden.
[comment]buh Biden needs to EARN muh vote!

nah but seriously Trump will nominate a 55 year old hyper-conservative to replace RBG, a 55 year old hyper-conservative to replace Breyer, and to spice things up, a 50 year old hyper-conservative to replace Thomas.
[comment]No 🙏
[comment]Yeah, uh.....no, no this is the "Establishment's. " failure to provide an "electable " candidate,  not to mention more of the same tired neoliberal policies and bullshit incremental change strategy to please your Wallstreet masters,  when t-rump beats your Republican lite candidate the only ones to blame are the DNC corporate whores, so yeah, go ahead and gaslight everyone and blame the voters , just like last time

[comment]His base love it. They believe this is what makes him a  "badass".
[comment]He’s not leading us into war because someone got under his skin. He’s leading us into war because it’s part of his re-election campaign.

Don’t you think there are bigger things at this point?
[comment]Who is this aimed at on r/Democrats?
[comment]Hillary will always be the winner. But deposed by an R coup, the standing for Republicans and Russia.
[comment]Absofuckinglutly this shit is on whoever voted for the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpf, that means the right wing nut bags and the stupid ass Democrats that wanted something different or didn't like Hillary,it doesn't matter who runs as a Democrat, whether you like that person or not YOU STILL VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRAT YOU BUNCH OF SELLOUTS!! now look what the alternative got us and is going to get us into!! Are you all going to pull that same bullshit if you don't like the Democratic nominee this year or are you going to come to your senses and stick with the party I hope it's the latter that you stick with the fucking party.
[comment]... every Bernie Supporter: *Doubt*
[comment]I must have used the word "stupid" to how people voted against Hillary and either for Trump, for a third party, or voted not at all.  I have stopped but really really hope that they vote more strategically in this election even if they can't stand Biden or whomever.  We need a Democratic ADMINISTRATION which, in case you didn't know, is thousands of people not just the one President.  I didn't even mention Supreme Court Justices.
[comment]PSST: she won the election

Finding wedges to drive between each other is doing Putin's work for him.
[comment]I don’t think this is a fair assessment AT ALL. Don’t get my wrong: Trump is one of the worst if not THE WORST president we’ve ever had. I would never in a million years vote for him and I will be happy when he is out of office. But to say that a war with Iran would be the fault of everyone that voted for him (1) absolves the Trump administration of responsibility and (2) doesn’t take into account how broken the political system in the US is and why Trump was elected in the first place.
[comment]Lol

<|startoftext|>[title]The Nightmare Scenario: Trump Loses in 2020 and Refuses to Concede - Kentucky governor's baseless voter fraud claims have experts worried Trump will do the same.
[selftext]https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nv98/the-nightmare-scenario-trump-loses-in-2020-and-refuses-to-concede[comment]Hopefully he won't make it to 2020
[comment]I can't imagine he will lose in 2020. I will be voting for him even though I am a registered Democrat. The Democratic candidates are weak this time and damn near incompetent.
[comment]Oh, I'm sure he'll refuse to concede if he loses in 2020.
[comment]He already said he wouldn’t accept a losing result  during a debate with Hillary.
[comment]My nightmare is that he is impeached, removed from office and then actually voted back into office....
[comment]Ok, and? What is going to be done about it? How are we preparing? We already know this will happen. The days of peaceful transitions of power in this country are over. This guy gets away with so much, that I’m pretty sure he could just refuse to leave and stay in The White House for as long as he likes. Especially if Dems don’t take the Senate and keep the House. That’s the real nightmare scenario.
[comment]The nightmare is him getting reelected.
[comment]he was already refusing to accept defeat in 2016 before he realized that he'd succeeded in stealing the election.  so we need to prepare for 2020 for sure.
[comment]I will certainly admit that Trump is different, but there have been serious, though partisan, concerns about every President not relinquishing the office going back at least to Clinton. Of course when the time comes, the look on their face is mostly relief.
[comment]I am fully expecting that to happen.

He's gonna call in the people that have been stocking guns to siege Washington. 

We are going to see how patriotic they really are.
[comment]pretty likely scenario we need to prepare for in advance
[comment]Trump is going to prison if he loses. He will do this and more.
[comment]I wouldn't mind voting against him twice. I'm pretty sure he would lose by a wider margin in a second vote.
[comment]Fortunately, he doesn’t have to concede. Conceding or not has no legal meaning. What’s happening in Kentucky is not a question of unwillingness to concede, but rather the legislature’s willingness to consider using the Kentucky constitution to subvert the election.

That’s not to say that Faux Nooz and the Trumpies won’t find a way to make up some bullshit argument about how he won the election even though he lost.

I would think the nightmare scenario would be him winning the popular vote and losing the electoral. Then suddenly he would claim it is time to retroactively invalidate the electoral college. Who knows what this Supreme Court would do with that.
[comment]Handcuffs. That's what will happen. Trump in handcuffs
[comment]He claimed there was voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election.... Spoiler alert, he won.
[comment]Although this is a very real possibility. I want to believe that considering Republicans in office won't be so caught up in tying themselves to someone who will (almost certainly) have been impeached and lost reelection.

They can make a clean break from Trump and not be held hostage anymore but an impulsive divisive President. What we've seen lately is hitching your wagon to the Trump train is not the best way to win elections. 

I think we know most Republican senators don't like Trump and can see a way out without having to speak out against him. They can talk about how the peaceful transition and elections have consequences.

I'm an optimist and idealist so I tend to believe the best in people so that my.color my views but I'm hopeful.
[comment]He would need to take complete control of the military, FBI and CIA to do this.  Pretty impossible.  A more likely scenario is that he does a bunch sabotage like shit as a FU to the country.
[comment]Presumes he makes it to the next election. 

The real nightmare scenario is we get to November 2020 and the Republicans have no candidate.
[comment]Hopefully 2020 will be such a bloeout their will be no argument, but that's a dream world
[comment]Concession is not a legal process. It doesn't matter if he doesn't concede. What matters is if he doesn't leave the White House
[comment]There is no basis for believing this would happen. The second the president elect is sworn in, anyone not in his or her administration will be removed from the White House by Capitol Hill police and/or the secret service.
[comment]I'd say the real nightmare is Trump winning... But yes, i can totally imagine him refusing to concede , especially if the result is at all close. His supporters live in an alternate reality and will believe any crazy shit he says about a stolen election. Could get very ugly.

I hope he is defeated by such a huge margin that there's no way for him to go down this path. This should be the goal. Complete annilhation of Trumpism.
[comment]well, someone be ready to physically remove him or designate a new Whitehouse and ignore everything he says or does.
[comment]Then the next president will have him dragged away. Looking forward to it.
[comment]Like anything else, this takes preparation. Talk to your friends and family and local politics organizers about this possibility in advance, such that if he pulls such as stunt, we immediately have people in the streets in DC and every state capitol.
[comment]Won't work. He will squeal as he is dragged to the curb, no doubt. I just hope his cult followers don't take anyone with them.
[comment]Who cares if he refuses to concede? Like it or not if he loses he will no longer be president, it doesn't matter how he feels about it
[comment]There's a straightjacket with his name on it if he even tries!
[comment]Russia will see to it that he prevails.  He will once again carry a number of key swing states by relatively small margins.  He will lose the popular vote \[again\] and win the electoral votes and the presidency.  

Russian hackers will once again throw the election in Trump's favor.
[comment]We should pass voter ID laws so he doesn’t have an excuse
[comment]Secret service will remove him and new president will be sworn in.
[comment]Fuck that notion. If he loses and refuses to call cede, then there will be a whole host of secret service agents more than willing to take him out of the White House. This is a country FOUNDED upon checks and balances.

We don’t let a despot to control the narrative.
[comment]Expect it. Unless it's a landslide victory for us, he's going to dispute it, the closer it is, the closer it could go to a supreme court vote.  Hopefully we can convince everyone who wants him out to swarm the polls in November of 2020.
[comment]If all the Democrats in America voted in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have won in a landslide. 

GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO VOTE!
[comment]Honestly, people seem to be thinking were gonna be having a civil war over this. If Trump refuses to leave then he just gets arrested or legally taken out and were fine. Historically there has been way worse complications and divisions during an election. The election of 1800 was the first time power changed sides in the US and people thought then there would be civil war, but there wasn't because they didn't want to destroy America. We aren't going to have a civil war over this because everyone who believes in our country and what it stands for will follow what happens in the election.
[comment]&gt;Feaver said Trump’s rhetoric is at the very least “deeply irresponsible"

That's the understatement of the century.
[comment]A narrow loss guarantees this outcome
[comment]Chaos is Trumps middle name (well that and Donald)
[comment]I have no doubt that when Trump looses that is exactly what he will do.

The bigger question is what will his lackeys do ?

Will they follow him down that rabbit hole or finally grow a spine and honor their oath to uphold the constitution ?

[comment]If Dems didnt win the house we'd all either be speaking Russian or locked in a gulag.
[comment]It is good that Hillary is giving credit to the activists. I have to give her credit for that. Obama has been going around shaming and patronizing our activists recently. Hopefully, more people unite around the base.
[comment]Hillary Great statement... However each time I see her my heart skips a beat and I think please don't run...
[comment]What's this dude talking about?
[comment]And now the candidates know to not call voters names. Ideally, the next Democratic candidate will know this too. Staying snug and cushioned in your little echo chamber can really, really make you lose track of reality. You're helping out FOX when you're being dumb enough to call Trump supporters (sensible candidates call them voters) names.

[comment]I wonder if he says the same thing about fighter jets and bombs???
[comment]Correct, you don't need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.. **You need more.**
[comment]He seems happy to downplay Coronavirus but watch his attitude suddenly change when he cancels the election on health and safety grounds.

[comment]He does know this all ends with he and his offspring in line to the gallows, right?
[comment]Try not to link to Fo卐 News.

This puppet dictator's bullshit is pretty standard at this point.
[comment]He just tweeted in all caps that ford needs to open a plant in Ohio and make ventilators...

It’s almost like crazy people have a hard time making up their minds.
[comment]Why is this petulant child still president? Seriously, as one of his cabinet what could you possibly have to gain by keeping him in office? 

The 25th amendment has been talked about to death, but regardless of how *likely* it is, the fact is it's plausible. 

Under the amendment's fourth stipulation, it would only take 14 people to depose the president — Vice President Mike Pence and 13 of Trump's 24 cabinet members.

Section IV reads:
"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President."

So what do these people think they're getting out of supporting him that they wouldn't get under Pence - and with significantly less baggage. Monumentally less baggage. They could get everything they have now, *and* Pence would go up against Biden and have a better shot at winning than Trump, so they'd be giving their odds of tenure a much better chance. 

What the hell is it that's keeping them supporting this man who daily, hourly gives them such grief? In three years and three months I have yet to hear an explanation for the GOP's sycophancy that stands up to scrutiny.

[comment]Let us look at two different scenarios. First, you have more ventilators than you need which means you spend more money than you need but a lot fewer people die than you expected. Second, you have fewer ventilator than you need, which means you get to play God and decide who lives and who dies.

Why? Because he knows he can blame us for the failures of his managment and take credit for the success once it's over. Brazen deceit has become a literal tactic.

<|startoftext|>[title]Sen. Murphy (D): Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That’s not a question. The question is this - as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?
[selftext]https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1212913952436445185[comment]That's exactly what Trump did. This will create a few, unnecessary jobs and rake in a few more campaign contributions to Republicans from companies within the Military-Industrial Complex. The reasons to impeach this asshat continue to build.
[comment] [https://i.imgur.com/GfE3TcZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/GfE3TcZ.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

Trump cries that Obama needs Congressional approval before air strikes.
[comment]Shut the fuck up. Nobody cares about congressional approval.

We just started a war by assassinating a top general. With or without congressional approval, we are the bad guys. This war is evil, and we should appose it on those grounds because literally nobody cares about congressional approval. The only reason congressional approval should even be mentioned is if we are arguing that congress would not have approved the action.
[comment]Isn’t this the distraction Trump wants, to get everyone off thinking about impeachment? Seems perfect to me.
[comment]Fuck Trump.
[comment]I’m afraid this isn’t going to be regional at all. As a result of this strike there will be attacks in the US.
[comment]I'll go out on a limb and predict that Trump properties will be early targets of retaliation.
[comment]Trump knew what he was doing. That's why he didn't tell Congress:

"A war between the United States and Iran would be a disaster. Even worse than the disaster after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Neither side can reasonably be interested in a military conflict. And yet both are currently in the process of escalating the conflict."  6 months ago during Strait of Hormuz escalation

[comment]Didn’t they say the Generals were going to stop Trump from doing something like this because they wouldn’t follow an illegal order? Isn’t assassination illegal?
[comment]Don't forget when we secured the Baghdad airport and risked lives to do so? Now its so unsecure that Iran Generals use it to attack us? You can't look at this as just an attack, have we lost Iraq? Time to come home.
[comment]Not only is a war convenient for Trump. One talking point I haven't heard talked about though relates to Trump/Republicans' BFF in the middle East. A particular guy/country who has a vested interest in killing Soleimani and potentially crippling Iran, but doesn't have the means to do it himself.
[comment]Congress should cut off all funding to the military.
[comment]Does anyone know, was Soleimani in Iraq legally? That would be an important factor in whether this was an assassination from a legal point of view.
[comment]And we are all still waiting ( after reading posts ) for some entity of authority within our government to actually enforce the law.
And, yeah this moronic clown and company DID just assassinate Soleimani . Fucking treacherous regime running the country...
[comment]You need to get Congress permission to declare war. And the guy was a terrorist. I’m not mourning his death and there are a lot of Iran People who are happy he is dead. So no this is not declaration of war so he did not need congress.<|endoftext|>

The son of supreme Court Justice Kennedy was the banker.

[comment]Is this the impeached and disgraced President Trump being referenced in the report?
[comment]This is like the second or third explosive report as of late. 

So many explosions. 

Is everyone ok?
[comment]Not really explosive in the sense that Russia in some way incentivized lending to Trump who in turn laundered Russian money. Probably did more than that tbh.

 But the new piece to the puzzle was the incentive to DB was a guarantee from VTB? Or was the news the fact that a guarantee from VTB was the equivalent of a guarantee from Putin? 

I keep saying, with Trump all roads lead to money.

[comment]Hey look! More evidence nobody’s gonna do anything about. So explosive.
[comment]To be sure, there is no doubt in my mind that DT is a kompromat under Putin's thumb but Forensic News? That site is sketchy and Kos should know better than to hitch their wagon to it.

You can tell they are from their expression as if they have a bottle of hand sanitiser waiting after shaking hands with their Democrat supporters.

They always look bored as if they would just "phone it in". No genuine smiles, bare minimum of brand.

Seriously I don't trust them.

Infiltrate. Disseminate. Eliminate. That's the Republican method; sway the states, distract the votes, race to the lead.

They're wingers for the other side.
[comment]I really don't want Trump Stresianding Bloomberg into a contender though.

[comment]Good on that governor.
[comment]Firing them was absolutely the right thing to do.

My only question is why the newspaper is pixelating their faces.   This is an official class photo they posed for and knew could be  displayed.  Show us their faces and let this follow them around when  they are seeking future employment.  I'd hate to think these people  could go out and apply for other corrections or law enforcement work and  potentially be trained and hired because they left this off their  resume.  No one who does something like this should ever be in position  where they carry a gun, a tazer, or a club and have lawful authority  over anyone.
[comment]Good.
[comment]The comments section has been essentially hijacked by people who rather talk about the Stanford  experiment,

which has absolutely no bearing AT ALL regarding the photo OR the West Virginia Correctional Officer class,

or the fact that they have been correctly fired after casually, stupidly, gleefully displaying Neo-Nazi salutes.

No one is offering the phony argument that the symbol began as a prank on 4chan to "own the libs",

which is fine; in reality since real White Supremacists and real racist mass murderers have been photographed, 

and caught on video, publicly using the sign, then if it DID begin as a prank, well, the morons played them selves.

&amp;#x200B;

So, are all of these students White Supremacists?

Probably NOT; SOME are, the instigators are,

but some of them very likely just followed along, caught in the moment of seeming camaraderie.

Were ANY of them making cognizant, correct choices as future correctional officers?

NO.  Absolutely NOT.  

They deserved to be fired for this, and they were.

[selftext]https://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-accused-genocide-letting-americans-die-betraying-us-2948388[comment]Obviously Fuck Trump... But this isn't genocide and it's irresponsible to try to say it is. Genocide is a systematic intentional action to remove a specific group from existence. Genocide is 8,000 Tutsis dying per day for 100 days. Genocide is Saddam Hussain gassing the Kurds. 


Trump is criminally negligent, and unbelievably petty, but he isn't organized enough to commit genocide.
[comment]I really hope Trump lives long enough to see what a fool history will show him to be. Corona virus will be in every history book. History will not be kind to Trump.
[comment]"Netizens", huh? Seems pretty serious..
[comment]I'd call it gross incompetence, not genocide.
[comment]What happened to the Jews is a Genocide. Rwanda, Genocide. Stupidity and poor decision making is one thing. With respect to the people that actually were killed for just being what they were, let’s find a better word than Genocide.
[comment]I think the descendants of Armenians who’ve been systemically killed by the Turks 100+ years would beg to differ.
[comment]Definitely not genocide. That’s not what happened, he didn’t commit biological warfare. He’s just incompetent.
[comment]We as Americans let that man be in office
[comment]This is a bullshit source stating an exaggerated version of the obvious to both increase its own status and discredit us.

Republicans kill lots of people by deliberate sabotage, all the time.  It's their agenda.  But it's not genocide, it's just sociopathy.
[comment]lol this OP literally doesn't understand the word "genocide"
[comment]Well, of course, it isn't genocide. that is just on a ridiculous level and although he's been bad, genocide is an entirely different universe. what I can say is that he is incompetent and has done a terrible job handling this crisis. his lack of leadership has resulted in chaos around the country and he could have done a much better job.
[comment]People love throwing big words around. As much as I despise trump he is just irresponsible and not fit to be president.
[comment]I get that trump has had a terrible response, but i have found it hard to come by concrete things(like, to use in an argument) that he has done/ not done that has made this epidemic worse. can anyone name anything in specific?
[comment]Genocide? That’s not the right word. Gross negligence is one of the words. It could be in the territory of some form of manslaughter although I only saw one (🙏) of those press conferences and that is the one where he said”what have you got to lose”. 

I think he was self aware enough to mention checking with your doctor which , if true, would get him off the hook.

But have no doubt, his gross negligence in this crisis has killed many and demolished an economy. We’re nowhere near the end.
[comment]Remember when back in like 2012 or something, Trump wanted Obama out of office because of 3 deaths of Ebola in the US... shouldn’t that be the same for him with a hell of a lot more than 3. (I don’t keep up with the corona stuff, idk how many deaths there were)
[comment]Jesus Christ

This is by far the winner for gross over exaggeration and shitty journalism I’ve seen over Donald trump
[comment]After the failed impeachment, it's now ok for the President to withhold funds and allow people to die if they don't help him out personally. I don't think its titled genocide maybe its just premeditated murder.

[comment]My God Bloomberg is so out of touch... I haven't followed him at all except the occasional Reddit comment and meme. 

He's running satirically right? Like he's gonna reveal in a month that it's all been an act? He's trying to teach voters that Donald trump can happen to the left? And we need to be careful?

I really thought it was hyperbole calling him the lefts Donald trump. You can feel the audience holding back boos when he was talking about his tax returns. My God.
[comment]Not a single viable candidate.
[comment]I like Biden. He's definitely not my favorite candidate, but I wouldn't have a problem with his nomination. But damn his speaking skills are the worst of these candidates. You can hear his age and it's really disappointing watching him stutter and unable to keep up with his own thoughts.
[comment]Is it just me.. or does it feel nearly IMPOSSIBLE to watch the democratic debates at your own pace??

I was at work when the debate started. Finding it impossible to watch from the beginning. Hell, I just paused it to put in my laundry and it JUMPED right to LIVE. 

This public information should be much much easier to find for voters. I feel like every single debate has been unnecessarily difficult to find. 

Can't rewatch it without some pundit's take or chopped up "highlight reel". 

Please someone correct me if I am wrong :-( but I have been pulling my hair out this year just trying to be informed.. and that feels so so wrong.

(sorry to rant).
[comment]I think Warren is taking a lead tonight. Good for her
[comment]This was a rough debate to watch. I think it will get more palatable once we narrow down the field. I didn’t get the presidential vibes from any candidate tonight but then again the bar has been set the lowest in our history as a nation.

[comment]Do we think any of the candidates on that stage would tab one of the others as their running mate when all is said and done? I’m having trouble thinking of a logical pairing.
[comment]Does anyone else wish these debates actually involved civil discourse instead of what feels like reality tv drama? I feel like they have to act that way because of the way the debate is structured, but it would be nice to just hear policy discussion without constant interruption or eye rolling from the other candidates.
[comment]You all saw strategy being worked tonight. Warren is in the 10-12% range and sees Bloomberg sitting at 19% (simply by spending). She went big game hunting tonight to try and pry some of that 19% into her camp. She likely succeeded, as Bloomberg came off as unprepared and disinterested. Mayor Pete at 15% went after Klobuchar's 7%, assuming he could get himself into the 20% range. 

Biden seems to be comfortable just ploughing along on his record as though anyone cares what he did 20+ years ago vs. what he'll do in 2021. 

Bernie is ... well, he's Bernie. He's divisive. You either love that crazy revolutionary hand-waving or you want to join the cops from the 60's dragging his ass to the pokey. The biggest problem with Bernie is that I actually agree with Bloomberg (which is gross): if Bernie is the candidate, he won't beat Trump. There's too much crazy there for him to pull the voters off their couches in November. (I realize this is a super unpopular opinion on reddit.)

Bottom line: tonight was about Warren and Mayor Pete trying to make this a smaller race by pulling a "This is Sparta!" to Bloomberg and Amy.
[comment]Disappointed at the lack of talk on policy, glad Bernie was the only person to give numbers regarding his universal healthcare plan rather than platitudes. That new study showing the $450b savings is a huge plus for him that needs to be argued, Pete was STUMPED at that response and could only fallback on a petty defense of himself, very telling moment on who has the most nuance behind their policy.
[comment]Bloomberg actually did alright
[comment]Am I crazy or is Bloomberg making a lot of sense to me? I mean initially didn’t look good when he got hanged up on but afterwards I’m really liking him. Also liking Amy Klobuchar

Maybe he should have tried expanding his base a little instead of spending the last three years just giving the middle finger to the 62 percent of the country that DIDN'T vote for him.

GOTV

Does Arizona really hate Martha mcsally/Trump that much?
[comment]Arizonan here.  We must NOT become complacent.  We must turn out in record numbers and vote for Mark as if he was 5 points behind.

[comment]Mark Kelly is a national hero. He's an engineer, naval pilot and an astronaut with countless medals to his name.

So no wonder he's leading Senatorial campaign contributions. His individual contributions are at $2.8 million while McSally's are at $1.9 million. Mark Kelly is outraising Martha McSally across the board, but he’s also picking up more individual contributions from unexpected areas, like some suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, where Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

[comment]Depressing part: still a huge chunk of America lived through the past 4 years and went "more!"
[comment]Cool. VOTE!
[comment]Just heard Joe Biden is leading what is called the haters group by 40% meaning the voters that didn't like Hillary Clinton for whatever reason and didn't like Donald j drumpf, we all know the reasons why they didn't like him.
[comment]FLIP
[comment]C’mon Kelly! I want to see this man in the Senate! 

Can’t wait, he would make for a great Senator.
[comment]Polling in Arizona is decidedly sparse, with the PI poll being the only one in May. But aggregating polls from February on, Kelly still has a 9 point lead. Only the two oldest polls show even a small McSally lead.

I think Arizona will end up going the same way on Trump and McSally. Right now, it looks like they will lose "bigly."
[comment]Bye Falicia
[comment]Got to give them both props for the hard work they’re doing. We can’t relax but these are nice leads.
[comment]It would be great if AZ turned blue.  I'm counting on Michigan and Pennsylvania though.  I've written off Florida, too many crazy folks down there.
[comment]This poll doesn't weigh by education and is more Dem-friendly than most polls. Also has Biden up 7.

[Polling average still has Biden up 4 though](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/Arizona.html) and [Kelly up 9](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/az/arizona_senate_mcsally_vs_kelly-6801.html). 

Plenty of time left in this ballgame.
[comment]As a note, the pollster (OH Predictive Insights) has a B/C rating from 538 ("average initial results") and typically slightly overstates Republican performance (&lt;1 point).
[comment]I’m newly registered to vote in Arizona and will proudly be voting Democrat down the ballot. I’m ready to get these scumbags out of office.
[comment]I'm sorry I miss quoted, the haters group are people that didn't vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald j drumpf, but 40% of them said they will vote for Joe Biden.
[comment]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/politics/voters-biden-trump-2020-analysis/index.html
[comment]I'm from CA, currently registered in TX but thinking of heading to AZ to make my blue vote count more. Glad to help.
[comment]I don’t trust Mark Kelly. If he’s elected we’ll never know whether it’s he or Scott that is governing that day. Like Christian Bale in The Prestige.

/s
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.
[comment]The 50 marker is really important here, and something that's very positive to see at this point in the race.
[comment]Assume the opposite, vote, get people registered to vote, get them out to vote, don’t leave anything on the field.
[comment]Can't wait to see the McCains come to an Arizona Biden rally preaching bipartisanship!  If there are any campaign rallies
[comment]Jesus's saggy left testicle that woman's face just screams "Karen" from a mile away.
[comment]woo go democrats!!!
[comment]A poster wrote for some reason a lot of people in the country hated Hillary most of the people that hated Hillary was the right, and they were so fucking wrong because look what we have now and look what it's gotten us into. Whether you liked Hillary Clinton or hated Hillary Clinton that WOMAN would have been such a step up from the deranged lunatic we have now it's not even close, if she's not the most accomplished woman in politics history then she's in the top five. All the right-wing does is throw shit at the left to see if it sticks and that's exactly what those right-wing trolls are going to do with Joe Biden and that's why we need every Democrat, Republican, independent oh wait and every idiot Democrat that voted for this deranged lunatic to come together to vote the orangutan out of office in 2020 so please, everyone get out there and vote or make sure to mail in your ballot for Joe Biden and Democrats down the board, let's show these right-wing trolls what a real blue Wave is on November 3rd. and continue to stay safe.

[comment]He may embarrass GOP women but he sickens the rest of us.
[comment]Question is, why is he only embarrassing to women? I think there’s a hidden message here about South Carolina women being the smartest between the two sexes.

[comment]Do not underestimate the power of soccer moms in the suburbs. They are a large group that is very active.
[comment]lol ok
[comment]Can we start calling him Leningrad Lindsey? Can we make that a thing?
[comment]I have a cousin who lives in SC. He posts anti-Trump/Graham/GOP stuff on Facebook. The replies from SC supporters are a shitshow of conservative lies and propaganda. Including women. The South is a lost cause.
[comment]/r/trumpgret
[comment]I wish to God that John McCain was still alive! I don't think Lindsey would dare pull this Trump-enabling shit if he was.
[comment]It would probably be the best thing for everyone if he lost the next election.  The senate gets rid of Lindsey and he can finally come out of the closet...
[comment]They should be embarrassed. He’s a disgrace.
[comment]He does given women from South Carolina a bad name.
[comment]*according to another politician
[comment]So you mean.... the pussy grabbing, thrice married, cheats on all of his wives, and walks into teen pageant dressing rooms president ....wasnt enough?

I honestly dont understand how any women can align with the GOP anymore.
[comment]Waiting for him to say “women of South Carolina, don’t abandon me! I suck dick just like you do.”
[comment]I just have one thing to say:
WELCOME LADIES: 
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
BUT MY GOSH WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? I bet if a man treated YOU the way this dirtbag treated women you wouldn't have stayed as long as you did with the man, at least I would hope you wouldn't have, because no woman deserves to be treated the way he treats women. As a matter of fact no person deserves to be treated the way he treats people. I can't believe I'm saying this about a president of our great country but then again, he's not a president at least not mine, he's a wannabe dictator and his name is Donald drumpf!!
[comment]My prior post was meant for a different headline but other than that welcome ladies, Lindsey Graham is no better than Donald j drumpf, he's a liar and the follower of the dear leader. Lindsey Graham will do whatever it takes for him to get a vote or do whatever it takes for him to be put into the drumph dictatorship. So ladies if your husband, boyfriend or girlfriendsl, aren't already on your side and voting against Lindsey Graham you know what to do to make them get on your side and vote with you, take it from a guy you know what to do ladies. hahahaha
[comment]The need to. One against Leningrad Lindsey
[comment]So they finally realized that he is gay?
[comment]Never underestimate the power of ignorance,cheating, intimidation and racism. I'll believe it when he's voted out of office only when I see it.
[comment]No offense but I'll believe that when I see it. White Southern women are super duper hung up on abortion.

I know moms with disabled kids who are like "I know my kid has preexisting conditions and is on Medicaid that Republicans want to cut but I gotta save da babies!"
[comment]Something is up with Graham Cracker. I smell another rat... If these republicans want to live in a Russia. Go there. Leave the USA to a democracy  🇺🇸
[comment]All due respect to Rep. Clyburn, but this is basically an anecdote. Him talking to one or two women who identify as Republicans who have expressed dissatisfaction with Graham and his Trump sycophancy, should not be taken to mean that this is happening on a large scale, as indicated by the word "flocking". Actual polls show that over 90% of Republicans, men and women strongly support Trump, and anyone who defends him.
[comment]Lindsay so nothing Graham... Has gotta go
[comment]The entire United States of America should be embarrassed by Lindsey.
[comment]'Bout time!!
[comment]People forget that Graham urged John McCain to turn over the Steele Dossier to the FBI in the first place.  So you could say Lindsey Graham is in the deep state and started the Russia investigation.
[comment]She is a horrible example for the women of South Carolina!<|endoftext|>

[comment]How is this not an offense worthy of incarceration. Should literally be jailed for this.
[comment]It's fine, let him literally waste his own time and the time of his fellow Republicans. The next Dem senate will just pass them when they get in.
[comment]There shouldn't be any way for one person to stop a vote in the senate...for either party.
[comment]We need to literally have laws passed to make what he is doing a felony offense.

It's fine if the votes aren't there to pass the bills. That's how it goes. But to table legislation voted on and passed is a violation of his oath of office. 

One man should not have the power to shut down the legislative branch. In other countries violence would break out over shit like this, yet here we just allow it.
[comment]How many of those has he actually read?
[comment]How many bills are sitting in the house from the senate?
[comment]Wasn't one of the main arguments in the Senate and by Trump's defense was how the trial would prevent the Senate from getting work done?

Na it's okay, just sit on those bills. When you're out of office and the Senate changes majority they'll get looked at properly.
[comment]"We're  not going to even vote on those." FTFY you unamerican POS turtle.
[comment]If they just sit, can a new senate hear and vote on them?
[comment]Guys, don't blame him! It's not his fault turtles are slow.
[comment]WTF? They aren’t even earning a paycheck! At least read the Bills and render a decision you lazy, worthless old people.

Hey MAGA’s, your tax dollars are just swirling down the drain. At least I can say the Dems are showing up, working and earning their paycheck, which is more than you can say.
[comment]But yet he is still getting a paycheck....
[comment]This guy is such a fucking cock.
[comment]Historically less than 8% of all bills even get voted on. This isn't news its just how the process works.
[comment]Can’t cancer or heart disease help us out with this POS Turtle?

[comment]This fool has done so much damage to this country. There's no way a senator from one state should have so much power. He does not represent the vast majority of us. We have no vote over him.
[comment]There is someone running against him.  I think her name is McGrath.
[comment]Don’t just place the blame on him. If the rest of the Republicans in the Senate disagreed with his actions, they could remove him as Speaker, and they haven’t.  If Trump disagreed, he would’ve pressured him to step down.  He is the face of a systemic problem with Republican leadership.
[comment]lol Cocaine Mitch is something else, isn't he?
[comment]Have they considered taking a few those bills back and amending them to add some pro-Putin and Pro-Russia sections?  They don't call him Moscow Mitch for nothing.

[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-livid-after-california-allows-statewide-mail-in-voting-these-votes-must-not-count[comment]Cuz Trump and most republicans would lose their seats if mail in voting was country wide
[comment]Kiss my fucking ass Trump.
[comment]Trump votes by mail himself.
[comment]He told everyone that republicans would never be elected of voting was easier, now everyone knows what they must do, you played yourself Trump!
[comment]Last election he claimed there were 3 million fantasy undocumented immigrants being bussed all over the place to vote in person, so he’s against that also.  Seems to me like he simply hates the thought of anyone voting.
[comment]No, sir. My vote will ALWAYS count!
[comment]I wonder if he realizes that Pennsylvania passed election law reforms, including new mail-in ballot options, *after* he barely eeked out a win there in 2016.
[comment]Let’s have the vote shoved up your ass.
[comment]The president of the United States is saying that the votes of some citizens must not count. This is getting normalized.
[comment]Good thing states run their own elections
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]Like it matters for him in California anyway, which he has zero chance of winning.
[comment]Trump Jail 2020!
[comment]*Absentee* votes.  Don't let them control terminology.  People know and are comfortable with absentee ballots and thats all this is.
[comment]Trump and the GOP seem intent on testing the ['4 Boxes' theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_boxes_of_liberty).
[comment]All the states rights Republicans are really going to give it to him for meddling in state elections and... Oh right.
[comment]The US military mostly votes by mail.  I guess their votes don't count?
[comment]So does that mean in Trump's weird world that states that have mail in voting, they don't count either?? Gimme a break!
[comment]Absentee ballots have been a thing since the US Civil War.  The US military votes by mail.  Is he going to disenfranchise active military from voting?

Trump only opposes mail in ballots because Republican strategists told him too many voters is bad for him.  The only fraud is Republicans trying to suppress the vote.
[comment]Oregon has voted by mail for years. Is he all the sudden going to say our votes don’t count either?
[comment]He should really just shut the fuck up. The states decide how they hold elections, not the Feds. Republicans were the one's who brought this all way to the Supreme Court. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder
[comment]He's rather transparently and poorly laying out the ground work to dispute the election if it doesn't turn out in his favour.
[comment]Wow they really should have the President take an oath or something to uphold the Constitution and let everyone do conditionally protected things like vote.

Oh wait...
[comment]&gt;‘These Votes Must Not Count’

Seems like a declaration of war on America to me.
[comment]Our president hates people voting. Lol
[comment]There should be an ad that basically paints Trump as someone who doesn’t believe in democracy, particularly voting, and put audio where Trump says that the USPS is a “joke” and this comment Trump said.
[comment]Is he really gonna try to say he’s win California otherwise 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[comment]Trump can suck my Washingtonian balls. We vote by mail here and our votes do and will forever count. No reason every state in the union couldn't do the same.
[comment]Statistically speaking, High voter turnout always favors the Democrats.
[comment]How is this not impeachable?  Oh right republicans are anti American cockroaches and tyrants who want to suppress anyone who doesn’t kiss their ass.
[comment]The point is that the Republicans know that the minority of Voters who do support Trump support him enthusiastically and will jump through any Hoops to vote for him. Therefore if you make voting as difficult as possible, only those who feel very strongly will vote, which will increase his chances.

In my opinion the reason he has such a enthusiastic following among the ignorant is a direct response to the election of a black president and many white people feeling that this threatens their prerogatives and privileges.
[comment]My wife and i have been voting by mail for the last 5 years. Military personnel vote by mail.
[comment]Voting is so undemocratic.
[comment]If not for the Cal Supreme Court ruling against the requirement Trump wouldn't have been able to be on the ballot because he won't disclose his taxes.

This is going to be the dirtiest, most cheating and vile election we've ever seen.  Buckle up.
[comment]Seriously what is the big deal?  Does he not want every American’s vote to count?
[comment]People should be allowed to go to the polls if they want. Although the military and Americans abroad mail in their votes, this should not be mandatory and there should be a way to anonymize the vote when possible. There are good reasons why the vote is secret.
[comment]Maybe if the GOP has popular policies then more votes would go to them... the problem is not the voters. The problem is policies.
[comment]Wait till he finds out about Arizona. 😆
[comment]And notably, has he deluded himself into believing he could win California? 🙄
[comment]Says the man who mails in his vote
[comment]I am not particularly well versed in politics and I am honestly confused. What is with people being against mail-in ballots?
[comment]This just shows you if you haven't already known that this guy is so fucked up in the head I mean he really thinks he can win California. Donald j drumpf is losing his fucking mind and the right-wing followers of this dear leader I guess aren't smart enough to realize it, because once again as I always say in a cult the dear leader is always right and you do what you're told and you never, ever go against the dear leader even though this wannabe dictator is always fucking wrong. And what a mother freaking liar this guy is my gosh I've never seen such a person in my life.

[comment]Make sure to means test the recipients first!
[comment]Come on Nancy you know better than we do that Donald j drumpf doesn't do what he is supposed to do, he does what his personalities tell him to do and that's depending on what personality is in charge at the moment, this is not funny I'm not trying to make a joke this is serious and this virus is a serious situation for all of us not just in the United States but around the world, and we have one of the dumbest m.f.ing wannabe dictators in charge. To all Americans please do not listen to Donald j drumpfwhen it comes to anything but especially the coronavirus rules,
please listen to the CDC recommendations to stay safe and free of the virus, I'm even talking to the followers of the dear leader at least to the ones that are smart enough not to listen to him but to the CDC.
[comment]He already did.
[comment]Heard he did this on early morning NPR...
[comment]Leave it to Democrats to be agains UBI because people who have money might get it too...

[comment]You did good Andrew!  Keep involved in politics.  Your ideas need you to champion them!
[comment]I liked a lot of his novel ideas, even the crazy ones.
[comment]He had some good ideas. Hopefully he stays in politics.
[comment]But he's the most popular candidate as decided by Reddit. /s
[comment]One of the few people running I respect
[comment]Girl bye
[comment]That dude was brutally honest about it. I respect that.
[comment]He was never gonna go far in this run, but he certainly made a name for him. I hope he invests his newfound political capital wisely and we hear from him again.
[comment]And that was the nicest article CNN has ever written about him.

Hope we get a good endorsement soon.
[comment]See ya in 2024 bro.
[comment]Thank you for running an amazing campaign Yang!
[comment]I was hoping he would gain some momentum as his ideas are fantastic.
[comment]What  a shame for yang to drop
[comment]The yang gang got gang banged.  Run for Senate!
[comment]It wasn’t his time yet, he made his mark and he’s young enough to return... at the end of the day, he worked really hard for this and I’m glad he can finally go home and rest with his family
[comment]hopefully there are other offices he can run for and add some experience.
[comment]I'll miss his campaign slogan.
[comment]Yang's ideas, impact and the movement he built were so important for many reasons. Presently, it expanded the progressive lane which gives a more positive perspective on other candidates as not so radical. And as witnessed currently by the rise of Bernie, a message over time allows it to percolate, mature and warm up voters to ideas that were once deemed too farfetched. In 10 years, UBI will be a very real discussion because of what Andrew Yang did in the past few months.
[comment]Wonder if Bernie gets a bump
[comment]I think yang should run for mayor of a major city (preferably NY for the exposure on UBI or Detroit to help turn around an area most affected by automation) and show off what his plans can do there. That way he can get some valuable experience and he can give the most extensive demonstration of his UBI plan yet.

I think he would be an okay senator or house member as well, but honestly I think a lower-level executive role is much more fitting considering his style and the fact that he's gonna have a much easier time implementing a UBI on a smaller scale as the leader than on a large scale as one of hundreds of congresspeople
[comment]Hopefully he is back in 2024 when more people know his name
[comment]I'll keep my yang sign parked right next to the BERNIE sign in my front yard.
[comment]UBI will eventually be a thing, crazy he was willing to push that mainstream now. I actually expected him to perform better though. I think he outclassed Pete in the debates, personally. I'm still confused what drives people to that dude, other than maybe his age. He is ridiculously smart, but doesn't really have any major policy plans other than... not being part of Washington? Is that all it takes nowadays?
[comment]Yang needs to run in the House or Senate.  We need Dems in Congress.
[comment]Yang’s campaign was too intellectual for this country and reading many of these comments proves that. It’s not that people are dumb and can not understand what he was saying because thinking that would contradict everything he stands for - but people aren’t used to a candidate who so deeply cares about fundamentally changing the way this country operates from how we measure economic success to how we engage with local communities to how we understand mental health and much much more. Yang stood for a better tomorrow and be believed in that. He has now fundamentally changed political rhetoric in this country and reopened the political sphere to normal Americans. It was hard to say goodbye but he really did shake things up and I’m so grateful for that. 

We NEED more people like Yang in this country and I hope he finds a way to stay acutely involved (cmon Bernie - you know what to do). 

Bernie bro in 2016 and I’m ready to return to his cause but never will I forget how an Asian man who likes math inspired me to think harder and want a truly happy country. Yang brought new ideas to the table - let’s not let them go too quickly.
[comment]He wasn't a bad guy and had he succeeded, he would have been a far better president than we currently have.  I applaud his efforts.   I hope the Yang Gang will become Bernie supporters!
[comment]Best candidate in the race by far. It’s a sad day.

[comment]Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

[comment]Ya reckon? I think removing 17,000,000 from the electoral rolls (8% of those who voted in 2016) is more of an issue.

Also, vote flipping voting machines that change votes to GoP.

Also, postal votes - that didn't get sent out. 

Also, minority discrimination where removing polling booths results in discouragement of mostly Democrat voters.

Also, Parscale's order of magnitude larger Facebook/Cambridge Analytica in its current iteration/Russia MkII scam.

Also, good ol boy Karl Rove's access to tallying servers. 

Also, substantive gerrymander in many what would otherwise be swing seats.

I love to be wrong, but I think Trump and the GOP have this sown up. They learnt from last time. America a functional democracy, not.
[comment]Hmm, Biden's base is also old folks. And Sanders has the best healthcare plan for dealing with such a pandemic. Good thing people don't vote on, you know, actual issues or anything! Gotta vote for whoever we're told is more electable.
[comment]It's actually middle-aged older African American voters that back Joe Biden along with I believe white voters with a degree, but seeing all theresults I've seen from the past 2 weeks Joe Biden is adding to his voter base he's picking them off left and right from Bernie or I should he's getting what some people are saying are Bernie's voters in the lower age groups, not as many but he is getting more than expected, and Bernie is getting less of the younger voters and other voting groups than he did in 2016. If you watched the news during the primaries then you know what I'm talkin about as far as Bernie's not bringing out what he brought out in 2016 and Joe Biden is freaking going way over what everyone thought he would do, and it all started in South Carolina, so I want to say something to a man that has more integrity in his little finger than the orange orangutan, wannabe dictator has in his whole body and that person is mr. clyburn of South Carolina. After he came out and endorsed Joe Biden it was like a godsend and once word got out South Carolina did not disappoint and I believe the other states especially the southern States followed South Carolina and James clyburn who gave such a beautiful speech prior to endorsing Joe Biden that people took it to heart and to the bank, so whether you vote for Bernie or for Joe Biden all I hope for is we all get behind whoever the nominee is. I finish all my posts like this, no matter who the Democratic nominee is whether it's Bernie or Biden in the White House we will get something we want, but if it's the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpf then we get nothing we want.

[comment]I can only speak for North Carolina but our rural areas have lost both hospitals and clinics over the last four years. There are some very poor and isolated counties here and I really don’t know how they would fare if this virus gets a foothold in their community.
[comment]I want to believe something will bring trump down but it’s not, they will find ways to blame others and call it a hoax.
[comment]I have run out of give-a-shit for those rural Trump bumpkins.
[comment]Well I’m not convinced that the risk of getting sick is gonna stop him. I think a recession based on the virus will hurt him the most because it will be Easy for dems to say. “Trump said he’d separate us from trade deals that can hurt the economy but look we’re still so tied up in foreign manufacturing that small business are being shuttered because factory workers in China can’t work”
[comment]Trump is going to hurt those that support him the most. As long as he’s triggering the libs, they could care less and will throw themselves over the cliff willingly. He said he loves the poorly educated because he knows he can manipulate them more easily. They’ve been brainwashed into believing the libs are the enemy.

Better late than never, but I'm still dissapointed in them for turning over the one issue that affects them most if I'm not mad about every other chance they had and wasted.
[comment]I don't believe it. They will swallow his BS whole and he will blame Democrats. He'll probably try to sell them his Trump-Dont-Care health plan which is a completely fictitious made up bunch of invective and flatulence.

[comment]Lol!!  You're still planning on running Joe against him, though...so it won't matter.
[comment]The response from Trump is shameful.  People still do not understand how contagious this virus is.  Granted, for those who are healthy, it is not much of a bother.  The problem we will have in this country is the lack of equipment, resources and personnel to deal with those that will become sick enough to need a hospital bed.  We do NOT have enough beds or ventilators for the people that will need them.  WHO do YOU think will get the precious hospital beds &amp; ventilators???
[comment]Vote him out.  Vote blue!

[comment]If there is ever a democrat majority, they need to ram through a shit ton of ethics legislation. Including defining impeachment procedures and removal criteria. 

Maybe even a law enforcement agency that works for Congress that investigates ethics violations in government and isn't subject to executive branch control.

So many lies and misinformation spread  that has irreversibly destroyed 20-25-% of conservatives, with them likely to spread the same nonsense to their offspring . Our country is doomed if we don’t take the senate or the presidency. I’m actually worried about something I never thought was possible ... a civil war. We effectively can’t stop republicans from doing anything . We can’t go to the justice department, nothing is getting done in the senate and trump has likely committed more crimes that barr is covering up . I honestly wish we had some crazies like the right does at this point . We are going down a path that will be very dark and we don’t have enough things in place to fight back .
[comment]The day that Mitch kicks the bucket will be a good day for all of us.
[comment]It really is disgusting and incomprehensible, that it could come to this. The US always had the anti-Russian mentality, but behave worse than Putin right now. And they do it without trying to be subtle about it. It's fascinating in a sad way.

I find it so weird sitting here in Europe and our media don't make too much noise about this. Of course we are all busy with the most threatening virus of all time (/sarcasm) and the conclusion of brexit (even though the real end is still a year away).

I hope we learn from this as we should after every failure. It was an interesting experiment but someone really should pull the plug now, before it gets out of hand (or did we already reach the point of no return).
[comment]I don't think it's a cover up if they've all decided that he committed the crime but the crime is no longer impeachable. There is so much evidence even from the first investigation that they actually changed their argument over time to be "he did it, we know it, but we don't care". I guess it just surprises me that power is more important than legacy.

[comment]To all Democrats, do not despair. History shows that the outcome of this trial is actually good for Democrats. In late 1973, less than a year before his resignation, Nixon lamented to an advisor “it’s the cover-up that gets you.”
Shar Democrats need to  do, is to build evidence upon evidence to turn public opinion.

In the US, 70,000 Americans have died and unemployment has hit 14.7%. The difference: competent government that heeds experts. Vote for that in November.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1258763760413683714?s=09[comment]Another difference;  They have a more intelligent, more compliant populace.
[comment]More points:

They also got hit with MERS more recently, so an epidemic was less abstract for them.

They also have a homogenous population with social solidarity. In the US, we have very poor social cohesion and strong distrust of government. People in the US reject social programs that help them if someone else who doesn’t look like them gets helped more. 

Thought experiment: HRC is president when this happens. Doesn’t matter how smart or competent she is. Easy to imagine Mitch refuses to bring any stimulus to the floor of the senate. Using the DPA to increase testing capacity is called an authoritarian over-reach and Cruz and Cotton call for impeachment. The president, while quite powerful, is less powerful than we often imagine.

It's a shame she wasn't more mindful of where and how to campaign and that Dems thought she was a shoe-in to win in 2016.  This situation would have been much different and far less dire if she were President.

\*edit - spelling

[comment]In a parallel universe, Hillary Rodham Clinton is the 45th President of the United States, and Covid-19 has been significantly mitigated there due to having a functioning Pandemic Office and listening to the scientific experts.

Thanks
[comment]Trump rode the Obama economic recovery that brought the economy to an all time high and lowered black unemployment.

Every president supported Israel.
Trump has done nothing but work against economic success 

He’s been pumping the economy with terribly low interest rates which is unsustainable and he’s destabilized the Middle East by doing what the far right thinks is best...not peace but antagonistic moves to bring about war.
[comment]I have been thinking of how to describe this presidency. It’s like there’s an extreme hypocrite at your church that you can’t stand to be around. This person has a group of influential friends who influence the decision making. This group usually has no power really, they are just all harmless and meaningless gossip. Suddenly, the pastor at the church puts this person in charge of the larger leadership role and is allowed to grant the friends of his liking to nearly all leadership roles. It’s now impossible for you to go to this church. Well, unfortunately we don’t have the option to leave.
[comment]Yeah this is correct. I can’t do 4 more years. Get me out of this circus.

[comment]paywall fail.
[comment]*Full text if paywalled for you; written by Fintan O’Toole*:

Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.

However bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.

Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world’s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world’s leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic.

As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, “The United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus – like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.”

It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time – wilfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party, and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence.

The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis,
demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.

If the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world’s leading nation – an idea that has shaped the past century – has all but evaporated.

Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in Düsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?

It is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.

What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump – he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety.

Thus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3 that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.

In Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and “recreational activities.”

Georgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1, explained: “We didn’t know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.”

This is not mere ignorance – it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the “deep state” and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.

Trump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.

The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump’s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has “total authority”, and on the other that “I don’t take responsibility at all”. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.

But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump’s presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand “freedom” in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that “freedom” is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (“I Need a Haircut” read one banner this week in St. Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.

Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder.

And the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.

That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US – it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality.

And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked “American carnage” and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element.

As things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.

Either way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again.
[comment]I'm a single issue voter....

Donald Trump's philosophy is

If at first you don't succeed, 

Lie, lie again.

Everybody lies, but Republicans lie more than Democrats, and Trump lies more than anybody else in the world, over 18,000 lies and Counting..

And, you'd think with all that practice he'd be good at lying by now but he can't even keep his lies straight from one hour to the next.

Why do people keep forgetting this.

When you tell a lie you insult the intelligence of the person you are lying to and you destroy your own credibility.

**When Donald Trump lies he destroys America's credibility, and our place in the world.**

**AND HE INSULTS THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOU, HIS BASE,** 

as they are the only ones who still believe what he says.

I think most people can agree that 1) adults need to be in charge of the country; and 2) a good faith opposition party is good for democracy overall.

[comment]the kids voting for Bernie are being brainwashed by Russian propaganda.

The Democratic Party needs be the adults and rein in the wild tantrum caused by the Bernie Bro-Shirts. People who actually know how to get things done in Washington should be the ones that decide who the nominee is because they're the ones that have to work together with the Republicans to compromise.
[comment]ViVa Sanders!
[comment]Article said that 4% of precincts reported in. They can call it for Bernie with 96% unknown? What am I not understanding?
[comment]BLUE WAVE Bernie Or Bust!!!    Lets Go DFL Democrats!     Register everyone you meet to vote this year !!
[comment]#NotMeUs #MedicareForAll #Bernie2020
[comment]Honest question for non Bernie Dems. If Bernie he plurality but not the majority are you hoping to pull it out at the convention? And what impact would a brokered convention have on the general election?
[comment]I'm just glad we knew who the winner was on the day of the caucuses this time.
[comment]I've heard a lot about the Latino voters who chose Bernie overwhelming at 51%, but I think the biggest surprise was self-described moderates/conservative democrats who chose Bernie exactly the same as Biden, 24% to 24%.

<|startoftext|>[title]Trump Can’t Postpone the Election — Congress could push it back a few weeks, but the Constitution sets the end of the term on Jan. 20.
[selftext]https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-cant-postpone-the-election-11588175516[comment]Paywall workaround:

http://archive.is/3M9Li
[comment]People keep saying this, but the fact of the matter is that Trump can do whatever Congress lets him get away with -- and so far, that has been literally anything.
[comment]I don't think the constitution is going to stop Trump from doing what he wants. It certainly hasn't so far.
[comment]Well also it’s not 1 election, it’s 50 at the same time
[comment]One would think that will all the complaining the left did on Trump and his sexual assaults, the Democrats would have a even slightest bit more integrity picking their nominee. Lol what a joke this system is.
[comment]Trump can cancel the election. But Nancy Pelosi will be sworn in as president on January 20th.
[comment]yay--i have hope for a new begiining come jan 21
[comment]Instead of canceling it, he just gets all voting done by mail (which Democrats can't oppose because we're all on record supporting it), then defund the Post Office so that's impossible, and then it's up to state legislatures to select the electors for us (which in turn can often be bribed).
[comment]Let him postpone it all he wants, I'm sure President Nancy Pelosi won't mind.
[comment]Jeez, if only there was a safe no contact way to vote.
[comment]Something tells me that January 19th is going to be a hell of a day....
[comment]What if they passed some sort of executive order extending his term? it appears executive orders can override the Constitution so....
[comment]That is going to be a very nervous few weeks
[comment]On January 21st Trump will be just an ex-President without power no matter what he wants. The only way for him to stay in office would be to change the Constitution or overthrow the government. If he were to throw a tantrum and refuse to leave he would be escorted out by the Sargent of arms. He’ll have as much right to sit in the Oval Office as you or I unless one of us is elected President.
[comment]He could refuse to leave office.
[comment]Trump will just appoint himself "Acting President" like he has done to skirt every other position.
[comment]You can rely on the fact that he will definitely try. Let's not rule out the right-wing SCOTUS Judges getting involved on his behalf either before or after the election.
[comment]If Trump declares a national emergency due to the pandemic and says he is suspending the election to prevent further spread, ALL of his supporters and the entire right-wing media apparatus will applaud and give him their full support. No one in the Trump administration, the right-wing media or the majority of people in the GOP give a shit about what the Constitution does or does not say. They only care about power. Mitch McConnell will completely support a move like this. Why wouldn't he?

Edit: Spelling and grammar
[comment]Not true.  They could and his term would expire with the VP as well.   The result would be speaker of the house taking over assuming California Gov appoints her as a representative after her term expires,  which he can do if voting is postponed
[comment]Get him out now. He’s fired. We need impeachment for this present matter!

<|startoftext|>[title]If Bloomberg Wants to Buy an Election, He Should Run as a Republican Against Trump—Not Sabotage Democrats
[selftext]https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/11/if-bloomberg-wants-buy-election-he-should-run-republican-against-trump-not-sabotage[comment]Kind of like Bernie with money?
[comment]He is for gun control, raising taxes on the rich, expanding obamacare... why would he run as a republican when he is clearly a democrat.
[comment]Definitely not the biggest Bloomberg fan but he’s quite a bit to the left of Manchin so how would running as a Republican make any sense?
[comment]He shouldn't be able to run as a democrat, period.  The rules shouldn't be changed so that he can participate.
[comment]https://www.dan-margolis.com/why-im-supporting-mike-bloomberg-for-president/
[comment]We’re presupposing he cares about the country though, and not merely his own vanity.
[comment]Still disappointed Trump had no serious primary challengers.  Infighting is one of the major reasons we lost in 2016, maybe it could've done Trump in.
[comment]You can't buy something that isn't for sale....quit being for sale
[comment]Stop, ask, frisk was originally passed with bipartisan support.
[comment]Um, party lines arent just chosen at random. It's based upon a loose set of principles. I'm not for trump but calling for a candidate to switch sides just to get trump out totally sounds ignorant. The president is a figurehead in many regards. The party has more power than the President. If you don't believe me, just look at the impeachment trial.
[comment]Mike should run as a Republican because he's a fucking racist ass hole
[comment]Heck ya! He's a republican anyway.
[comment]This argument fits into both the Bernie Bro camp and the Russian sow Democratic distention to help Trump camp.  Regardless, UNIFY or Die.
[comment]Except that clearly a good amount of Democrats support him in recent polls
[comment]Why would he run as a republicans?
[comment]Commondreams is leftist breitbart. It is not a legitimate news source.

[comment]More Bernie Bro spam.
[comment]That $600 million dollars could be spent in so many better ways than stupid commercials. If he took $600 million and fed and clothed people he would have a staggering number of votes right now. Instead we get to see his lame commercials which is nothing but an ego stroke from a racist guy who will spent over half a billion but doesn't want higher taxes on himself.
[comment]What Bloomberg should do is buy Fox News and make it an actual news station instead of a propaganda machine.
[comment]GOP is for when you steal the election, not buy it.
[comment]Anyone who would post they prefer Trump to Bloomberg, or would abstain is likely a Russian troll. Yes Bloomberg overspends in ads but at least he has integrity. I'm not saying I prefer him as the nominee but I prefer the Democrat nominee over Trump

[comment]**But don't get complacent! Vote no matter what!**
[comment]Real talk raw economic forecasts in this insanity seem inadequate.  

Also something that has Biden winning OH and N.C. but not Arizona seems laughable.
[comment]Don’t miss this one. Register now.
[comment]Don't get me wrong I'll eat a literal crow if it ends up true but this model is dogshit
[comment]VOTE
[comment]I know everyone hates this comment.

Polls are only accurate when we work to get everyone registered and to the voting booth! But most importantly, get yourself registered and to the voting booth. The vote is all the matters.
[comment]Still way, *way, way,* ***way*** too much red. 

But then, 30% of the country are certified idiots, so...
[comment]We’ve heard this before. Fucking vote
[comment]We won Hawaii last election lol and I think we flip Florida or Arizona instead of ohio
[comment]Promise?
[comment]marketwatch trying to jinx us
[comment]When people say “don’t get complacent and don’t trust the polls” - correct them by saying:

“Run up the score on the gop.  Vote your ass off!” - it uses positivity and optimism as the catalyst to vote and look forward vs. using fear.
[comment]Do not get complacent!
[comment]OH and NC, but not AZ? Suspect.  And HI is not flipped
[comment][This](https://www.270towin.com/maps/0mjkZ)is my prediction as of now.
[comment]Look realistically he lost by over three million votes last time and still here we are. So nobody get any kind of hope until 2024 and even then he's probably going to win again
[comment]Ignore this, he could still win. Show up and vote!
[comment]VOTE and make sure your friends do too.
[comment]That would explain why the Democrat states are against opening up "and I thought it was because they were saving lives". 
The economy will thrive and you all know it.
[comment]In normal times with a candidate who could tie his own shoes maybe.
[comment]I really hope this ages well
[comment]Sad that he doesn't face historic defeat irrespective of the economy, but if that is what it takes, I'll take it.  We need him OUT (and jailed, but I'm not holding my breath).
[comment]Doesn't matter. Campaign and vote as if we were 5 points down in every state.
[comment]This is not an accurate interpretation. They are looking at these number and drawing conclusions based on the unemployment rate and other economic statistics, but they fail to account for the level of blame that is shifted from Trump to the pandemic. In a normal year with an economic collapse and 20% joblessness yes the sitting president would get railed in the next election. But that is not the case, many of the people they expect to abandon trump won’t because they don’t see this as his fault.
[comment]If Trump loses we will not know whether he truly lost until December 14 when the electoral votes in each state have to be certified. Trump being Trump he will sue the heck out of the states, claiming widespread voter fraud. It will be Florida 2000 on steroids. If his loss is close, with the help of his friends at the SCOTUS, he could even pull it off by "uncounting" some democratic states... So, we'll have to wait....
[comment]PA isn't flipping, sorry. This is based on a crazy small sample size, sure, but I'm from PA in a mix of city/rural area, and every seems to have pegged Democrats as evil power-grabbers of the pandemic.

Covid is certainly not damaging Repubs here. They let the problem get so bad it takes drastic political action just to sort of flatten the curve and then blame it on "government" and people eat it up, as if Republicans weren't part of the government. It genuinely pisses me off.
[comment]God I hope it’s right. I just remember the trauma of 2016 when all the polls showed Hilary was ahead and then afterwards I couldn’t even get out of bed.
[comment]For Pete's sake! Do we need to have the world falling apart for people to realize how despicable, incompetent and retarded Trump and company is?
Yeah, we are even more retarded than him.
[comment]Also, they have Arizona red-- I think its going blue this time, Mark Kelly is going to drive people to vote for him, which means, not Trump.
[comment]Pennsylvania is going to be red. People love him here.
[comment]I don't see how Arizona doesn't flip blue. "Let old people die to save the economy" isn't real popular with all the old people here. Also Kelly should crush Mcsally.
[comment]Didn’t we get complacent in 2016, and we ended up with trump. I hate the feel good, we got the bad man based off polling. 

Trump only faces defeat if we VOTE. Polling does nothing but give people false hope that we’ve won. PLEASE VOTE AND DON’T BE COMPLACENT.
[comment]Historic as in someone punting him ala Uncle Phill style out of the white house after he loses, or as in loses by a huge margin despite voter suppression and russian interference?
[comment]VOTE
[comment]Why is Hawaii labeled as flip to blue? Wasn't it already blue
[comment]If we work, Arizona can flip. If we work, Florida can flip.
[comment]Doesn’t matter. Honestly, I feel that these studies just shouldn’t be put out. It makes people feel like they don’t have to go out and vote. No matter what, EVERYBODY GO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. This is going to be my first Presidential Election and I fully intend to make it count.
[comment]Based on what I have compiled - it’s 337-201 for Biden. This is based on RCP Averages and if no polls, then I just used the 2016 result. Chances are if there aren’t polls, the state isn’t changing.
[comment]I watch and read these reports everyday but its important  that make GOTV outreach our priority. Especially with absentee ballots a main-point of frame. Talking about how to  register, rules and regulations, lastly, the court battles ahead.
[comment]Trump lost bigly in Hawaii in 2016.
[comment]Plus he's a monry-launderer for the Russian mob.
[comment]How is economy his fault ? It was booming before the virus. Did you ever give him credit for unemployment all time low and s&amp;p all time high?
[comment]Today as I was heating up supper I thought anyone who voted for this ass clown should be paraded in the streets to do the walk of shame. They brought shame and dishonour to America.
[comment]Even propaganda couldn't keep them out of hot water this time.
[comment]IGNORE THE POLLS!  They were WRONG in 2016.  To say goodbye to Trump,  you must VOTE!
[comment]Cool story, but forgive me if I don’t trust white people to vote for a democrat just because Trump is a liar, an asshole, a cheat and a danger to this country. All of these things were true in 2016 and they’re even more true now. Ugh.
[comment]Weird that the map has Hawai’i as flip to Democrat. Hillary won here in 2016 with the highest margin of any state.
[comment]Lest we forget how he won the first time.... Trump could lose the electoral vote "bigly" and still get a 2nd term ..... every single vote will count<|endoftext|>

Biden needs to beat Trump electorally.  In 2016, Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million by won the electoral college by 5 states with just 75K votes.

Biden needs to beat Trump overwhelmingly to show Republicans that this country wants none of the Republican bullshit.
[comment]Bull$hit. Anyone remember this?  [Hillary has a 93% chance of winning](https://i.imgur.com/gaQLSFW.jpg)
[comment]We need to beat trump in a landslide. Everyone has to vote. If we only beat him by anything less than 10% they will attempt to invalidate the election and start a civil war. Everyone in every town across America needs to vote against him and all republicans. Only then will we find peace.
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.

Keep fighting until January 20, 2021. Keep working on non-political friends. Win at the dinner tables and coffee tables. We win when we vote. We win because we have better ideas and an inclusive vision for America.
[comment]All he has to do is smile and not say anything and he should win.
[comment]Just thought I’d remind you guys that Hillary was supposed to have the same sort of lead in the polls
[comment]Only if we vote for him! Go Joe!
[comment]This is still way to low. Its actually fucking depressing.
[comment]It don’t matter if we don’t vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.
[comment]I don’t care. VOTE
[comment]Let's wirk harder to a point that Biden be 80%ahead of TRUMP...let's not make same mistake of 2016
[comment]Polls don't matter. Vote
[comment]That lead aint big enough
[comment]Not good enough. Run up the score. Lets beat him by 20 points and humiliate the fuck out of Trump.
[comment]I'm not very enthusiastic about voting for Biden (seems like a nice guy just super out of touch) but I will. Same as I did for Hillary. I really wish the Democratic party could come up with better candidates.
[comment]Trump isn't even trying to be a real President, leading the country through a period of building crises. The stupid thing is that in times like this the country yearns to be led. Anyone who even tries gets some benefit of the doubt and receives bipartisan support, like many Governors from both parties currently.
[comment]This isn't just about Republicans either, it's other Democrats who are fine with another 4 years of Trump because Bernie lost or because they only agree with 90% of Biden instead of 100%
[comment]Got to keep it up! Have to spot Trump at least 5 points, imo, because of Republican voter supression, fraud, and an unbalanced electoral college.
[comment]Trump's not completely stupid -- he's trying to start a civil war because it's basically his only chance. Barr's going to help him round up his enemies, you just watch.
[comment]Don't get cocky folks, Trump used the complacency strategy last time too.  Everyone was so sure Hillary wod win they just didn't bother showing, or voted for Jill Stein like I did.
[comment]And yet, Trump leads in *every state he won in 2016*.
[comment]Remember when Hillary had a 20-point lead. These polls are jokes
[comment]We must VOTE to make this happen! Believe no polls. And it has to be a landslide so that Trump cannot refuse to leave OUR White House.
[comment]Compared to 2 points two months ago. Holy shit
[comment]I would like a moratorium on all posts about Biden being ahead. If every single one of our blue asses doesn't turn up in November, we are sunk. Don't forget everyone in Wyoming gets 2.4 votes to yours, or something like that. VOTE!
[comment]Obligatory and unnecessary: "don't be complacent" and "I hate polls like this. We have to get busy"
[comment]Remember nov 2016 and the distortion that could be caused by electoral college system. It is not popular vote based election and Russian government is helping him. 
Don’t be overly confident on this.
[comment]DONT TRUST THE POLLS! REMEMBER 2016? PLEASE VOTE!
[comment]More importantly a poll came out with Biden up +6 in Michigan.
[comment]Polls don't mean shit.
Except the one taken on November 3rd.

Fuck these polls.

Vote.
[comment]Keep him hidden and don't let him talk. We need to remove Trump, and this is the garbage fire we were given. Prop him up!
[comment]Just VOTE! PLEASE!! I don't want to see the US turn into an authoritarian dictatorship.
[comment]Let’s not get cocky!
[comment]Biden will gain some ground the next few months albeit slowly.  Luckily we get to replace one asshole with another - yet a lesser asshole.

[comment]No man can walk so long in the Shadow that he cannot come again to the Light.

[comment]Fox News is acting like state media more than ever, broadcasting the trial without sound and with conservative pundits "explaining" what is happening by using GOP talking points. It's total bullshit. It's like the two sides are arguing from different realities. This is why Nancy Pelosi (to give some credit to her political foresight) wanted to hold off; she knew the Republicans would be shredding the Constitution on the senate floor. Almost half the GOP senators skipped out on the trial entirely the first two days. The right is claiming the left is partisan, and here they are with their minds already made up to exonerate.

This is how we should frame the charges against the President:

The President hijacked Congressionally allocated public funds and used them as bargaining chip in a sleazy personal deal for his own benefit with the government of a foreign nation. This is a slippery executive slope that leads to presidents openly giving and receiving bribes to influence policy, and even misappropriating public funds entirely for their own gain.

The president, like every president, is governing the whole country, not just his base. He is accountable to those of us who did not elect him (the majority in fact) and who are unhappy with his business as usual.

[comment]It really doesn't matter who is president both parties are the same and never get shit done. That and it's more important who is in the House and Senate. They make the Bill's and set the budgets. They maintain the status quo so they stay in power and we stay on the bottom. Hillary probably would have been better than Trump, but fuck the DNC for pushing her and Biden over Sanders. Blame the DNC for pissing a bunch of people off by them pushing who they want to run, instead of us voting who we want to run. Don't let either party let you get sucked in to their bs. Always vote for who you want to run, not who your party wants you to vote for.
[comment]Hillary would not have let things get like this.
[comment]And those people are doing it again with their EvRyOnE eXcEpT BeRnIe Is A rEpUbLiCan.
[comment]The Russians did a helluva job pushing this narrative in the primary and general in 2016.  If you fell for it, shame on you.  If you fell for it again in 2020, you have no excuse. 

If Bernie Sanders loved his country, he would have understood what the FBI told him about Russian interference on his behalf and suspended his campaign.  What they are doing (and did in in '16) is triangulation.  Use Sanders to poison the well in the Democratic primary, suppress support on the left, then prop up Trump while pushing the false "Hillary/Biden is corrupt" narrative to stoke up the plurality of dumb dumbs on the right to have enough of a plurality to win in a low turnout situation.

There's a reason Trump had Rudy Giuliani do what he did in the Ukraine: he didn't want to face Joe Biden in the Fall.  Getting Biden out of the way was the goal that made him impeachable.  

Because it always goes back to Donald Trump.
[comment]With the amount of love Wall Street had for HRC and Bill I think they are not the savior that we had hoped for. The reality is no political party is in a position to deal with this. The closest thing would be what this party calls a revolution that no one wants. 

A question that I felt like they missed in the debate and the thing Biden keeps talking about when asked about Yang (not the MATH). He says Yang has a vision for the next industrial revolution and it is upon us. That should maybe be the focus. I know we fear that airlines going BK is bad. Instead of infusing money into the corporations that are profit over people we should maybe hear what Yang is thinking is coming, something Biden agrees with, and then maybe the money we are printing is used for this approach. Giving Casino's, Airlines and others this money that just evaporated and did nothing to stabilize the market and think about how the people can be a part of owning the next iteration of those. 

The what we could of done is not important. What a Democrat should do is look at the future. Where are we heading vs the past and using whataboutisim, that is the other side. We gotta be thinking about tomorrow not 2016 or 2008.
[comment]Hillary would've only been slightly better. Our system is broken.
[comment]Actually Joe and Hilary supported the Irag war like a republican....
[comment]STOP BLAMING THE PEOPLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM!

Seriously, get over it. It’s almost 4 years later - start focusing on the future, not the past. You aren’t going to change anything by making people apologize and explain themselves for not voting Hillary - especially when the people did vote for her but the electoral college flipped the results. 

There’s so much misplaced anger here and you’re just driving people apart in a time that we should all be rallying together.
[comment]Hilary hate is a real disease. How anyone could think she and trump are the same or that she’s worse is beyond me. It seems people still haven’t learned their lesson.

We sold them those weapons.... 😂😂😂😂then went to war about it. Stupid war that should not be forgiven so easily
[comment]But her emails!
[comment]After the developments over the last four years of this despicable administration, I feel like these discussions are almost moot.

The Republican party have fucked our system so fully that it's almost useless for their adversaries to continue. When we win, they dig their heels in and prevent any progress we attempt. They showcase their trademark faux feelings of being offended, and then begin the Fox News rollercoaster of misinformation and vitriol. I can't decide whether I blame the lawmakers for being so comfortable lying to their constituents or their voters for willingly believing such hateful bullshit.

Thanks to Mitch McConnell, Donald McGahn, and the Federalist Society, nothing can be accomplished anymore. They've changed the rules, pumping out confirmations for incompetent, strongly conservative judges at breakneck speed. Lifetime appointments, ensuring a small group of selfish assholes will be the only ones with a fighting chance at the pursuit of happiness, for at least the next twenty years. 

I realize it's what they want, but I can't help it; I've lost all hope and can barely bring myself to stay informed. Even if we win, we've already lost.
[comment]They will never admit to their bumbling mistake of voting for the anti christ
[comment]It's fucking unbelievable that any Democrat could make the analogy of someone being "wrong on the level of the Iraq war" when Democrats apparently forgot that *Joe Biden fucking voted for it*!

Hold people in contempt and have them arrested if they refuse to cooperate. I understand the need to gradually tighten the screws on Trump, but at some point we’ll need to go beyond tough talk if we want to get these goons out of office.

[comment]She is not dumb.
[comment]The irony is that after all the years of being demonized by GOP she emerges as a central force in guiding the investigation in to abuse of presidential power.

But the president is just the tip of the iceberg - the figurehead - of a greater problem. We have the president we have because of a failure of the GOP to provide any other alternative. If for no other reason than by omission the party allowed Trump to be the standard bearer for the party. But in reality he is just a red herring, a distraction while the GOP continues to dismantle governmental regulatory controls and allow big business free rein at the expense of the American people.

Time for a change.

<|startoftext|>[title]Obama Said Publicly Shaming People On Twitter Is "Not Activism"
[selftext]https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/obama-call-out-culture-yara-shahidi[comment]He's right.
[comment]Still making space for the shitty behavior of republicans, i see. This sounds noble and everything, but this mentality is why the Bush regime was never investigated for war crimes, and why republican shittiness was given space to escalate during Obama's administration. You can turn the other cheek TOO much. Sometimes you have to block the punch and say "ENOUGH, fuckers!".
[comment]I love Obama but molesting women went from “what you gonna do?” To jail mother fuckers and destroying careers from shaming people on Twitter. I get where he’s coming from but he cites ambiguities but Is missing the ambiguities of this phenomena. Also a significant amount of acceptance of lgbtq issues that came from this. Good and bad Stuff came from this just like every other thing human beings do. So moving the needle massively for at least 2 groups of people that are marginalized makes me err on the side of this is activism
[comment]That is true.
[comment]Winning the war of public opinion is very important however. Republicans prove this with their endless smear campaigns and frankly Democrats need to fight fire with fire more often.
[comment]I would think this is common sense but here we are.
[comment]Sometimes it is...
[comment]I really miss that dude.
[comment]I mean it's also the purity tests. Warren supporters hold every other candidate to impossible standards while deriding everything they don't like about their candidate as an unfair attack. Her cultish populism scares me.
[comment]He couldn’t of summed  it up better. Cancel culture on social media is essentially armchair activism for the most part.
[comment]Hey, where did we land on that Kony 2012 thing?
[comment]I miss having him as president but dude, if he would've clapped back more often and quit seeking compromise with bad-faith rat-bastard republicans, we might not have had to be in this mess now.
[comment]Fuck that means that like 97% of millenial and gen z activists are actually activisting
[comment]Who is surprised that Obama gets it. Just think of how much better off the country would be if there was never a 22nd Amendment.
[comment]What did he say about posting memes on Reddit about Hong Kong? Because if that's not activism, then I don't know what to believe anymore!!
[comment]Obama has a small point that it is not enough to simply shame bad language on twitter.  He goes way off the rails when he then claims:

" “This idea of purity, and you’re never compromised, and you’re always politically woke and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly,” he said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.” 

Isn't it funny how dems are always told to compromise but Republicans NEVER do since Newt Gingrich?

&amp;#x200B;

Given that the ideologically pure Tea Party kicked his ass for 10 years straight, took the house, senate, judiciary, blocked his nominees, blocked his legislation, dismantled much of his legacy, then took the white house and put a criminal in there who is now stacking the courts with judges who will likely never be removed.  You'd think Obama would have learned that all his compromise with Republican Right Wing Tea Party has only made them stronger and Dems weaker.  Sometime I wonder if this guy was secretly Republican all along.  He reminds me of those cowards who appeased Hitler and Confederates pre-war, and all the compromises only made the evil people stronger, bolder until it blew up into all out war.
[comment]Only 22% of Americans use Twitter. 10% of those 22 are making 80% of the content on Twitter. Twitter is not real life, and we need to stop acting like it is.

[Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/)
[comment]So nice to hear a president that speaks in complete coherent sentences again
[comment]Yeah, 'direct action' would be burning their house down yourself.
[comment]It’s not activism, but it’s not necessarily bad either! 

Some people/institutions should absolutely get roasted all the time in every context imaginable.
[comment]but,, how else will the "woke" ones let us know who to hate?
[comment]The Twitter verse simply needs to be ignored.
[comment]Then publicly shaming them in real life isn't activism either. But that's what protests are and you can literally do both.

Because that's how free speech works.
[comment]Oh look, a Boomer who doesn't get with the times.

It does count as activism, especially considering the undeniable IMPORTANCE of social media to the Millennials. Sure, a Boomer sees it as a little distraction on the side, but to the younger generations?
[comment]No shit. Young progressive twitter’s “cancel culture” is beyond stupid and the most any of them will ever do for political activism.
[comment]Yeah, but I remember 2 or 3 protest who genesis was Twitter. So, I disagree with the president on this. Twitter has motivated many to run for office,  and get support and funding. Ifnit were not useful Trump would have been on it for the last decade.
[comment]The truth hurts.
[comment]Trump could learn a lot from President Obama if he wasn't so freaking jealous of him. If Trump had just an ounce of the class and integrity that President Obama has,  then he probably would not be in the situation he is in now. 
And, frankly,  no one should insult anyone in any way when they know nothing about that person.
[comment]&gt;Obama went on to say, "This idea of purity, and you're never compromised, and you're always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly."

&gt;Calling for more nuance in difficult conversations, Obama said, "The world is messy, there are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you."

Glad he's saying it.
[comment]I disagree, calling out bad actors and publically shaming them is absolutely legitimate activism. It's definitely not the only thing a person should be doing to effect change, but I disagree with, B-Money on this one.
[comment]Lol, idiot.
[comment]But bombing the middle East multiples times a day during your entire presidency is?

Of course, I’m not one to automatically assume the constitution is important to others; it’s certainly a mixed bag, and a racist bourgeois one at that. 

I’m of the opinion that if we decide to get behind politicians who stop diverting the blame away from who is really responsible for our societal ills (monopoly enterprise, intelligence agencies, bipartisanship - in that order) and start taking steps to really help the working class, there’d be a less dense accumulation of grievance and therefore less raw material to be churned into misdirected hate by politicians and talking heads on both sides

[comment]She’s a grifter and a con.
[comment]To me she seems believable that something happened to her, though at this point I couldn't say what. Contradicting details and confusion over what exactly happened, and how they responded, isn't exactly unusual, and neither is suddenly coming forward about it much later. There is reason to believe something traumatic happened to her based on what could be found through some past testimony and documentation from her divorce.

What made me finally lean in Biden's direction, as an outside observer, are the logistical problems for him to attack her in the way described, the apparently impossible fund raiser story, and the lie she told about her education. As an outside observer, I can't in good conscience say Biden likely did it. I'm glad some journalists took it seriously, and were able to put out a more clear investigative report (like PBS), woth extensive interviews with past colleagues and experts. That helped some in me change my opinion.

<|startoftext|>[title]Virginia will eliminate a state holiday honoring Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. It'll make Election Day a day off instead
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/virginia-ends-confederate-holiday-replace-election-day-trnd/index.html[comment]Sweet. Election Day should be a paid holiday nation wide.
[comment]Yay!!!
[comment]"But how will we win if we let people vote?" -Republicans
[comment]What — legislators did something sensible? I think I finally landed in a universe I can enjoy!
[comment]My mother belongs on /r/insanepeoplefacebook. She said this is a precursor to the left coming to take all of our guns away.

She's a midwesterner who has transplanted to florida and is semi-retired. She lives in a boomer echo chamber where any mention of removing statues or removing public adoration for the confederacy is somehow the left planning a takeover and indoctrination. It's downright looney.

I got tagged in one of these where she was all "see"? 

I typed in a public post that both Obama and Clinton each had 8 years to take our guns and couldn't even get that done. Gosh, what shitty presidents.
[comment]I have a feeling this could enrage Republicans and turn state red again OR (if enough people vote) state could be blue for a long time.
[comment]Yup yup. Yup. Hopefully passed before 2020
[comment]Good.  Election Day should be a day off nationwide.
[comment]Well good for Virginia!!! Now can the rest of the country do the same for election day?!?!
[comment]Its unfortunate that people such as myself still won't get this holiday off work. But this is a huge step in the right direction.
[comment]This day was actually Lee-Jackson-King day in Virginia until 2000. Yes. You heard it right! It celebrated Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson...as in Lee and Jackson of the Confederacy AND simultaneously Martin Luther King..of...I don't really need to go on. Do I?

Is/Was Lee-Jackson Day a day people get off work in Virginia? I didn't think so. 

I don't predict this is going to make too many people angry except maybe in rural areas? Now, tearing down the statues is a totally different ball of wax.
[comment]Robert E Lee is a goddamn hero. He could not bring himself to fight against his homestate of Virginia. He is also the reason why the Civil War ended at his surrender and shot down southern ideas of continued insurrection following the surrender of the south. The union would not have reunified without him.

The Civil War was fought over slavery, but that is not why Lee fought.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this day should probably be removed, but don't make him into a villain.
[comment]How bout the next one be the Day of Straight Up Compassion.
[comment]This is an amazing development.  Voting is always the most patriotic holiday.
[comment]Those infamous historical figures should be talked about so people don’t repeat history, but I am glad they aren’t being celebrated and that Election Day is a day off (as it should be). 

I’ve had parents who watch the Hannity channel flip out over this, saying the left is trying to rewrite history (and yes they are boomers). I’ve explained to them how Fox News is very unreliable and that America isn’t erasing history, we are simply not celebrating the confederation. We will learn about them and not forget about that time period, we just aren’t celebrating traitors, which is what they are. Maybe if people grow up seeing that these figures aren’t being celebrated than the whole “the south will rise” mentality will start to fade as well as bigoted ideas.
[comment]If you wonder why you suddenly see so much news about common sense reform happening in Virginia, see [this](https://i.imgur.com/BpAwiII.png) and [this.](https://i.imgur.com/nk6aXgY.png)

Virginia has an entirely Democratic government right now.

I live in Michigan. We've had the exact opposite for a solid 8 years, a trifecta of GOP control. Our roads are shit, our schools are shit, Flint happened, were still fighting the federal government over trying to keep the Great Lakes clean, it's like Mad Max over here.
[comment]You creatures sicken me.
[comment]The Confederate government issued a standing order that all African-Americans caught in uniform were to be killed on the spot or sold into slavery. There is no record of any Confederate general protesting that illegal order. Lee never tried to stop his men from murdering blacks they caught.

Robert E Lee and Stonewall jackson are war criminals. That's your heritage.
[comment]Good! I hate participation trophies.
[comment]I'm sorry to say this because I don't know you but it sounds like your mother could be a casualty or even a member of the dear leader Donald j drumpf cult following and for your mother's well being you need to stop her if she is doing this from only watching state-run FAUX NEWS because this is where most of the lies are coming from and the other news station is oan one America news this new station makes FAUX NEWS look almost normal, I mean oan is the conspiracy news channel these people are absolutely batshit crazy. And no the Democratic party or anybody else want anything to do with taking people's guns it's just a right-wing conspiracy talking point but tell your mom what isn't a conspiracy talking point but is the truth,It's that Donald j drumpf wants to take healthcare away from people especially people with pre-existing conditions and he's lying to everybody when he gets on TV and says he's trying to save it and if she doesn't believe you just get online because there's a case pending in federal court right now from the Democrats to stop the administration from taking healthcare away.

[comment]There could be a hundred videos and these white pigs are never going to see the inside of a jail. Just the way it is. 

1. It's the south. 

2. The shooters are white.

3. It a former cop, and his son. 

4. The victim is black. 

5. The D.A. is *already* making excuses for NOT arresting them.   

6. Did I mention a white, former cop, in the south, shot a black man for no reason and the DA refuses to investigate.

Pretty much a lynching minus the crowd and souvenir snatching by the assembled crowd.

Damn, time literally stands still in the south, doesn't it?
[comment]#blacklivesmatter
[comment]Maybe someone can explain where the proof of the white guys being guilty is in the video?  I don't see it.  What I see is the black man running toward the truck, I see the video suddenly showing a view of nothing, I see the black man run around the side of the truck and then I can't see what's going on.  I hear gun shots, I see the black man and the white guy struggling over the white guy's gun... then I hear the last gunshot and the black guy finally starts to try and run away from the guys before he collapses.  But no where do I see enough to know what the hell was going on.  Yet here we have all these people dead set that it was murder...  at the very least someone explain why he was running toward the truck and trying to wrestle a gun from the white guy.
[comment]It’s upsetting how many comments here bringing up armed protesters, while the focus should be terrible police force.
[comment]Not a single armed black person protesting as far as I know.
[comment]Murica'. Claims to be first world, yet kills innocent people.
[comment]Why is this posted on this sub ?
[comment]This was a goddamned lynching. But everyone should understand that these men will not be arrested for this, much less convicted. Too many of their buddies working in law enforcement. Nothing will happen to these men unless the citizens take it upon themselves. Protesting will accomplish absolutely nothing.
[comment]We all bleed red.
[comment]Things will regress further if these two pieces of shit don’t get 20 years to life
[comment]If 2 armed men cornered me I also would be scared for my life and would fight back. You can't outrun a gun, so he probably saw fighting back as possibly his only chance to get away.
[comment]It's really important to understand what happened here. This is a hate crime. A black man was hunted down and killed by two white men after being racially profiled. If the racial roles had been reserved the black men would already be in prison. But the two white men who viciously murdered this black men are still free.

It's 2020 and this kind of racism still existed in the United States.

Again I think 50/50 in the Senate is quite likely.  Colorado, Arizona, and Maine are big trouble for the Rethugs.  And Cal Cunningham is a strong candidate who will outperform Biden in NC.  But after that things get pretty uphill.  If we want a working Senate majority, we're going to need a landslide where some of red state Senate races are in play.<|endoftext|>

[comment]what about all the people arrested and killed for nonviolent crime
[comment]Police brutality doesn't just encompass killings. There are endless videos of black people being brutally beaten by police while not resisting in any way. None of us should be supporting authoritarian violence against any race.
[comment]This kind of stuff is pushing me away from the party. This is plain ignorance that I cannot stand behind. Goodbye.
[comment]Despite the fact that African Americans commit 50% of the crime they only make up 30% of those killed by police, which means the police are less likely to use lethal force on African Americans.
[comment]Tweekers. Nobody is up in arms about tweeker deaths.
[comment]Jesus, what about sample size? Aren't black people only 13% of the population?
[comment]What’s truly sad about all this rioting is that it’s minority communities that are being destroyed and most likely will never rise up again
[comment]Such a stupid ass take. No one's denying law enforcement has a difficult job that may, on occasion, result in death and injury. The point is that law enforcement officials have been getting away with callous and almost hateful murder of it's citizenry and specifically the black population for far too long.
[comment]Another thought to add:

I'd figure that the arrest rates for African Americans are higher than it is for white people. They could have more deaths total but significantly more arrests which would be even worse.

Edit: I should proof read my spelling...
[comment]What the rioters are doing now, no police for has done or can do. They say they are for the people yet they are the ones affecting more minorities than any law enforcement
[comment]This means nothing without context. If you have 1000 black people arrested and 4 of them killed during the process against 2 whites arrested with 1 of them killed, you can brag that 50% of white people are killed during their interpellation against 0,4% from the  black community. It's bs but the numbers are correct. The demographic perspective is also  necessary: if 12 people die out of a community of 15 persons when 30 persons die out of a community of 300000, the second one is a tragedy that may reveals some problems inside its society, the first one is a genocide.
[comment]Yea but also per capita isn’t taken into account, is it?
[comment]So the problem is: A lot of people are cops that shouldn't be?
[comment]Ok. How many blacks/whites are killed during NON-VIOLENT arrests?
[comment]1. This small selected statistic (without citation of real data by the way), asking “how” is an argument based upon weak foundation. There are countless other statistics that would indicate that the system is racially biased towards African Americans.

2. George Floyd did not commit violence, so why are you referencing this statistic in the first place?
[comment]Do you guys not see that white people make up 70% of the crime and blacks make up like 29%. So by my math shouldn’t be that more whites should be killed by cops seeing how many crimes they commit.
[comment] Where are all the videos of cops actually using racial slurs? It's bad for anyone to die like that but damn it we need to focus on black on black crimes and fatherless families. And get off the plantation of welfare.
[comment] Well, a lot of blacks are killed without being accused of a crime. So....
[comment]George Floyd wasn't committing a crime, he tried to cash a $20 check and was then slowly choked to death for 8 minutes
[comment]Ok so I just had a progressive argue against this point with me. Someone please chime in if they can refute it.

Their argument was sure more white men are killed by the police. Even though black men commit more of the crime. However the only reason black men commit more crime is because the black communities are over policed. 

So there is more from being committed in white communities but the police aren’t there to catch it because all the resources are spent in black communities.

My only arguments were what empirical evidence do you have for that? As well as low socioeconomic status tends to lead to more crime which is rampant in the black communities.
[comment]They dont care about police brutality at these protests. I was there.
[comment]Truth is 99% perception and 1% facts. add on top most people just want quick and easy answers to complex problems, this will always give you delusional responses.Americans don't really know what they asking for in these protest, they just know there's a problem and they want it fixed with the easiest and quickest solution. and of course that's never going to work, and most likely make to problem worse or move the problem elsewhere. but they keep fighting for it none the less.
[comment]No, not true
[comment]But my emotions!
[comment]Can I see some stats on non-violent crime? Because most of the cases of black people killed by police were in cases where either they were being charged with a nonviolent crime, such as George Floyd, or cases where no crime was known to have been committed.
[comment]Isn't the issue about brutality and killings without even being arrested?
[comment]Fake asshole!!!
[comment]What about non-violent
[comment]I’d be curious about how many were “justified” and the amount of armed vs unarmed
[comment]how about the peaceful black people being killed! you're a fake puppet!
[comment]Is it not clear that what's missing here is the number of African Americans arrested for non violent crimes that are killed. That's the hidden number here.
[comment]Yes but we don’t now what the black people did and what the white people did. It’s not a matter of fact how many gets killed it’s why
[comment]“Are Coos Racist” and “The War On Cops” by Heather Mac Donald are both brilliant books on the subject.
[comment]How about:

1) how many other cops have as many complaints against them and are still cops? 

2) who reviewed all of these complaints against this cop and decided he could still be a cop?

3) were any of these complaints ever brought to the attention of the mayor or DA? If so, hold them accountable at the ballot.

4) these complaints should be reviewed by a committee that includes citizen representation.

If you really want to fix the system, start asking these kinds of questions of every mayor, chief of police and DA in every district and precinct across the nation. Keep asking until you get acceptable answers. This would be far more effective than protesting or rioting.
[comment]Are there stats for for non violent crimes and being killed by police? Also what about other races?
[comment]Y’all know data can be modified with it still be technically true right? There is a reason he didn’t post for all crime not just violent.
[comment]What about non violent crimes?
[comment]How is it possible?

It's a statistic not per 10,000 violent crimes, it's not even per 10,000 people arrested. The statistic is # people killed per 10,000 arrests.

If 1,000 people are arrested 10 times. That'd be 30 killed per person arrested.

If one group commits 2 crimes per arrest and the other commits 3 crimes per arrest, that's enough to offset the difference.

What is the actual truth? Difficult to say without the numbers. But, there is ample evidence that blacks are targeted for arrest at a far greater rate than whites.

Additionally, it's not only violent criminals that are shot. For those two years, 5.9% of whites killed were unarmed, while 8.4% of blacks killed were unarmed.
[comment]How many more 10s of thousands of black people are arrested over whites though?
[comment]Without the numbers for people killed while being arrested for non-violent crimes or receiving a citation, this is an incomplete dataset.

The protests are about the use of excessive force on non-violent alleged offenders.
[comment]When were we talking about VIOLENT crimes?
[comment]This is the stuff we need more of.  I'm getting lit up by friends and family for standing by my ideal that this is a police issue, not a race issue. I've been educated that I'm a racist.
[comment]If black people are arrested more frequently for violent crime than whites it would both account for this statistic and be evidence of pervasive policing bias. This one fact by itself isn’t really enough to prove anything though it does provoke interesting conversation. Also where is this stat from? Jc
[comment]More white males since 2017 have been killed by police than black males, just sayin.
[comment]Yes and black Americans make up 13% of the population. All killing is bad, but there is a bias against black Americans, which has been the case for a while now..

Anyone who wants a source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/
[comment]It’s not just about racism. It’s about the institutionalized police state. Black cops have abused the power to white civilians too. It’s not just racial but also an issue of police having zero accountability
[comment]Far too many people brigading this thread think this is some sort of attack on black people, as if they are being blamed or demonized.

I think the vast majority here recognize that black people disproportionately suffer from socioeconomic issues due to racism and other reasons. They are targeted for petty crime, frisked more often, and put away for charges other people may not be convicted of. Our horrendous prison system destroys their life, and puts them in contact with hardened criminals.

But that doesn't change the fact that police killings are directly proportionate to violent crime. For whatever reason, police killings are a color-blind issue, everyone should be equally pissed off. Trying to frame it by saying, "I'm tired of hearing of black people die." just comes off as ignorant. You are hearing of black people die for the same reason you hear about car chases - they draw in views.
[comment]Although the links provided are still confusing as there is too much info i don't know where to look lol i'm just going to assume the numbers are correct. The way i see it is every person of every race should be treated equally and have the same priviliges. These figures just prove to me that we all need the band together in solidarity to make the change happen and kick racism once and for all. I am a white man from the UK and i've realised it's not enough to just not be a racist but we need to do something about it. The governments over the decades/centuries have had all the power to make this happen but they have chosen to ignore us and divide our nations and will continue to do so,  so the blame lies almost entirely with them. It is now up to everyone of every race to challenge our governments and force equality measures.
[comment]Simple explanation, only look at the numbers for when the murdered was not peaceful and then also add the people killed not during an arrests (again while peaceful) and then you will see the bias.

[comment]Wonder why BLM doesn’t protest black on black crime. Oh wait they think black on black crime is cause by white people
[comment]There's a lot of back and forth on that thread, his sources actually aren't very good, one of them actually states that they were counted at under half the reality, as lots of precincts don't report the killings. Some people on there also cited other sources on there that said that black people get killed disproportionately more, but this is probably due to the disproportionate amount of crimes they commit. It seems like there are sources that show both sides being correct, so it's hard to really work out what's true and what to believe.

[comment]If you look at the statistics, white America hates all minorities but then also loves Asians more than themselves.
[comment] 60.6%  of the population are white 
12.3% are black 

So maybe run those numbers again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]How is the left so dumb?
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/r3p4t6i2i2v41.jpg[comment]I dont think all of them are dumb it is just they blindly listen to the media and do whatever they say
[comment]Shouldn’t it say , “People who Listen to the President”. -
[comment]https://twitter.com/MichaelCoudrey/status/1254212267324784645?s=20
[comment]This is how one ends up on the left.
[comment]Some things the world may never know.
[comment]Why do you think it’s people on the left who are listening to Trump and following his advice? 

Poison control calls regarding exposure to household cleaners in NYC have gone way up since his comment.
[comment]Sometimes I wish they would and have natural selection sort them out. lol
[comment]i can't believe this is a real sub
[comment]I really don’t think it’s the dems that the drinking bleach joke is referring to. Its not like dems listen to Trump anyways, they’re not going to start because of this. I’m fairly certain this is the dems attempting to make fun of or mock republicans for “blindly following” him. This is just trying to flip the narrative and say “nuh uh”. Not coming to the dems support but I think you’re misinterpreting the joke the dems are making and claiming it’s the Republicans making the joke
[comment]I wouldn't even care if people drank or injected bleach or lysol at this point because you can't fix stupid and I'm tired of everyone having to try.
[comment]Left?
[comment]I was talking with my S/O about this today. The media has been so successful in convincing the left that Trump is so stupid that they genuinely believe stories like this now. 

If you hear the media report that a functioning adult said something so stupid that even someone with an IQ of 50 would know it's stupid, how can you possibly truly believe he really said it, a natural human response would be "There's no way he said that, you're lying or misleading or misquoting or something" but they have been so brainwashed into believing he is literally retarded that they believe more and more implausibly stupid things.
[comment]Yes "misinterpreted"
[comment]Wouldn't they be the ones NOT listening to trump?
[comment]Trump didn't even say that lol, nancy pelosi is just a piece of human Trash
[comment]Dude honestly I'm not voting for Biden. To be honest I cant vote for anyone. I'm from South Africa, I just love american politics. I didn't mean offense. I was just sharing the view of a foreigner who comes from a country with a difficult past full of lies and misinformation. So I take an interest in this all. 

Bidens a joke and a fool, but I dont think he has racial division, corruption and self enrichment at heart. As south park said it really is a douche and turd sandwich. 

To be honest it's hard to believe what's happen to America, the once pride and envy of the world, now looks like a wounded clown. All I hope is you guys recover from this.
[comment]You guys remember a few years ago when people, mainly teens &amp; young adults, were dumb enough to do that stupid Tide Pod challenge all because The Onion did this satirical story  [So Help Me God, I’m Going To Eat One Of Those Multicolored Detergent Pods](https://www.theonion.com/so-help-me-god-i-m-going-to-eat-one-of-those-multicolo-1819585017)? From there it went to Twitter, Tumblr, and eventually YouTube where a Aaron Swan started the challenge. All of that was because of social media and complete and utter irresponsibility. No, I do not say it's completely his fault for this. *However*, in this age of narcissism where everyone needs to share everything and will do just about anything for recognition, karma, points, etc., it was *somewhat* Swan's fault.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, as the leader and Chief, President Trump is supposed to lead by example. He is not to make asinine statements and leave an impression that it is acceptable, smart, witty, cute, fun, etc., to do things like inject disinfectants. He is speaking to the same audience that Aaron Swan spoke to. Impressionable people. Whether you guys like it or not, he messed up. You cannot justify what he said. It was dangerous. Now you're probably thinking I'm a leftist, or Anti-Republican. In fact, I *am* a Republican. But I am also a responsible person and a realist. Is injecting disinfectants dumb? Of course it is! But don't dismiss the fact that people listen to our President and will, at his direction, be willing to try things that are dangerous. He's our leader. Again, lead by example.
[comment]Darwinian for sure. If you’re that stupid ..
[comment]Wow it’s honestly refreshing to see conservatives be self aware enough to be okay with making fun of themselves. Well done OP
[comment]Here’s the reality: he could say the sky is blue and they’d find some way to object.  In this case, they’ve once again taken something out of context and plastered it into headlines so that their base, who only reads headlines, will get riled up.
[comment]The Right be like, Electrolytes: It's what plants crave!
[comment]I’m pretty in the middle and what he said was still bad. Then to say he was being sarcastic. Maybe save the sarcasm for after a pandemic. 

Also why not just admit fault like ever.
[comment]well they elected a reality tv star so thats why
[comment]Listening to the full transcript of this and other Trump faux pas that got blown up, the real issue seems to be that Trump doesn't have the filter that causes most of us, when we're spitballing ideas, or just learning about something for the first time, to keep this news to ourselves.  


Do such impromptu statements by him get blown out of proportion?  Yes.  Does he need to learn to contain them better in order to better project calm leadership?  Also yes.
[comment]This post makes me want to leave this sub
[comment]These are the people who force politicians to speak a different language and be very rehearsed, evading, and indirect vs. just speaking plainly.
[comment]Keep Ina Garten out of this!
[comment]as a trumper i think he should control what he says
[comment]If they were average IQ or higher, they wouldn't be lefties.
[comment]Dat projection
[comment]They ate Tide Pods so what did you expect?
[comment]Why on earth do you think the left are the ones listening to him?
[comment]Dont get me wrong, he says some dumb shit. We aren't brain dead, so we know this. However...its is not nearly as bad as the Democrats make it seem. Especially compared to their Candidate. However, its so horrible that they hear one thing and run with it for weeks in end in attempt to smear him as much as possible. It is ridiculous.
[comment]The left has never been more of an ouroboros than they are with this stupidity. Not one person on the right is falling for this crap.
[comment]The only people who think he meant anything approaching reasonable are his lapdogs Even Trump disagrees with you. He's had to lie about it being sarcasm because even he realises what he said was dumb...why cant you?
[comment]Except it isn’t the left that is calling in asking if this works....
[comment]r/therightcantmeme
[comment]Cuz they went to college for liberal arts
[comment]Trump is perfect. Trump is divine. Trump is infallible.
[comment]The Trump deranged media obviously jumped all over this. For some, whose blood pressure doesn’t rise at the sight or sound of Trump, find it refreshing that he does sometimes think out loud. Say what you like, wrong or right, Trump is spontaneous and consequently honest most of the time
[comment]If this is this subs biggest hangup and the libs fav (at the moment) drum to beat then damn we still got it pretty good!  He’s a great Prez and he’s denounced and demonized by every last person in the media, liberals and all RINO’s. They charge him with BS hoaxes and straight up coup attempts on a regular basis. They’ve all been proven completely false and blaming him for corona is the latest. You’ll see during the debates how well he speaks as he obliterates Biden.. same for November when he wins in a glorious landslide.  This bubble of Reddit and twitter aren’t an accurate representation of the American people.
[comment]Still he's the only Prez that has the guts to stand up to China
[comment]He seemed kinda direct about his statement. He just says dumb things.
[comment]Donald Trump: “I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that.”

The right: “HoW iS tHe LeFt So Dumb?”
[comment]Wait I thought he was being sarcastic
[comment]They weren’t ever taught to think. Sheep since day one
[comment]This has to be a joke. 'misinterpreted'? You lot can't be that stupid
[comment]Impeachment didn't work, so now they are purposely being obtuse. They would absolutely kill themselves in a bid to "gotcha!" the President.
[comment]oh, right we should inject it, not drink it. oh actually sorry it was just sarcasm on national television in the middle of a pandemic.
[comment]this is an astonishingly stupid post
[comment]https://www.newsweek.com/gop-maryland-governor-says-state-received-hundreds-calls-asking-if-its-ok-ingest-clorox-after-1500274
[comment]You mean you trump lapdog are the stupid one right?
[comment]I won't be surprised if people on the left intentionally drank it to stir shit up.
[comment]The amount of people I made mad with this post is fucking hilarious XD
[comment]Are they just deleting every democrat comment?
[comment]Left: Omg he said inject disinfectant into the body, he’s so dumb.

Right: No, he asked if it was possible to use disinfectant to kill corona in the body. He’s not a medical expert, he’s the president.

Trump: I said it sarcastically, to make fun of reporters like you.
[comment]You’d all be making memes of Obama doing this if he said exactly the same thing
[comment]If Trump didn't out right advise this...you all have to admit that he suggested it....

Take an honest look at what he said.....take a step out of the echo chamber
[comment]What did he mean by his statement then? I'm curious
[comment]Please don't ban me for this question, but I seriously don't know what he meant. Can someone please help me understand, normally I am with Donald but this one has me a little perplexed
[comment]How is that any American can possibly think the media is impartial? It's clear that they're out to attack him daily for any and every excuse they can make up. And we are supposed to trust them to fairly moderate the presidential debates? Trump should just bypass them and do something online directly for the voters.
[comment]These comments are why I left politics. Lol who the fuck would try and pretend that suggesting injecting disinfectant isn't some of the dumbest shit ever said.
[comment]So what did he mean?
[comment]Why is that liberals who have such an affinity for Socialism and Communism try to paint conservatives as fans of Putin?
[comment]you are very stupid and so is trump
[comment]Lol the left so stopid. MR. trump would never suggest this
[comment]I think the issue is not that people are stupid or may do stupid things. Many people from all social classes and all political wings are sometimes stupid or sometimes say stupid things. Many well educated people also do or say stupid things.
That is ok, we do not have to be smart all the time. We all deserve take break.
Except when you go on national television during a crisis and you are the President of the USA. Then you really need to put your game face on and be smart. There is no leeway for saying stupid things in such a situation.
Personally, I am not American, but I travel to the US regularly and have family and friends there. I sympathize with you all in this situation and wish you all the best to overcome this challenge despite the handicap.
[comment]“I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that...So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body...,”

Did he tell people to inject or drink disinfectant? No.  But he suggested it be studied as a cure. It's like someone saying fire kills germs and suggesting we should get it "inside the body" to study it as a cure.
[comment]If you believe he was being sarcastic or making a joke, you’re a gimp of the highest order
[comment]Something that you inject that disinfects you from disease is called medicine. The fact it's even been suggested as something new to consider is worrying.
[comment]Let's run through the timeline of this shall we?

1. He says we should look into injecting disinfectants.
2. The media reports on what he said making him look incredibly stupid
3. Fox news and other right wing news outlets claim he's being taken out of context.
4. Trump, as expected, cannot bear to look stupid so he tells reporters he was being sarcastic.

So tell me was he taking a national crisis lightly by being sarcastic? Was he taken out of context? Or is it more likely he's a bumbling fool? One would think all of you would say he was being sarcastic as that is what he, himself said, but no in your defense of this nonsense you people are all over the road. Get a grip on reality and face that you elected one of the dumbest people alive.
[comment]Trump literally said, “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute,” referring to disinfectants such as isopropyl alcohol that had previously been brought up at the briefing. “And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets inside the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.” When he was later pressed by The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker on why he was trafficking in such speculative ideas, Trump didn’t back off or give any indication it was some kind of ruse. Instead he got angry with Rucker.


But setting all that aside, Trump just threw all those people who made the argument McEnany was making under the bus.


One of them was Breitbart News, which Thursday night quickly ran what it portrayed as a fact check of Trump’s comments. Witness this amazing argument: “Trump used the word ‘inject,’ but what he meant was using a process — which he left ‘medical doctors’ to define — in which patients’ lungs might be cleared of the virus, given new knowledge about its response to light and other factors.”

[comment]Fuck Teddy Roosevelt!!! P.O.S.!!!

I like that Peyton Manning is in a tie on the upper right side, though. Still sporting that 8-head.
[comment]Why the hell would Teddy Roosevelt be there by Trump?  One was a conservationist, the other one wants to destroy everything that Teddy stood for.
[comment]TRUMP 2020!

[comment]I like how far they put Taft back there 😂
[comment]The fact that half the comments are calling this painting terrible shows that half this subreddit doesn't belong here
[comment]Painted by Andy Thomas. Good piece. The woman approaching in the background is supposed to be the first woman president. There are also a couple more nods in the piece.
[comment]Trumps head is too big.

<|startoftext|>[title]And this is why we need guns people! When the govt becomes a police state and comes to your doorstep shooting for you being outside your OWN house
[selftext]https://streamable.com/u2jzoo[comment]They’re using paintball guns, just an fyi. It’s shitty and they shouldn’t be doing that, but it most certainly doesn’t justify shooting them
[comment] Follow police orders you fucking idiots. What do you think is going to happen when you disobey orders from a group of terrified, riled up police members.
[comment]what are you going to do with your guns? shoot police officers? go to jail for life for killing a cop?
[comment]All over bully and shutting down barbers and restaraunts. But the riots start and no one is around.
[comment]It's a curfew, what do u expect, an invitation?
[comment]Was this done because they weren't obeying curfew? A curfew imposed because were being criminals. The officer said "Stay in your home".
[comment]It’s how they are doing this. They look untrained. Lack of training and lowered standards is what cost the first life.
[comment]I bet people will be 100 times  happier to see these cops than a group of rioters burning down homes and property.
[comment]You’ll discover very quickly the difference between the police and military.
[comment]But if you got rid of all the guns then no one could shoot at you on your own porch.just saying this article seems a little flawed in how it sounds
[comment]Could someone tell me why this was quickly posted here but it took a while for it to appear on r/Conservative and it seems to be quite controversial there? Do these subs not have the same demographic?
[comment]I guess the government has decided the white neighborhoods need to get on board with the coming summer of rage.
[comment]The 2nd amendments purpose is literally for this situation
[comment]I would shoot them with my scout, would tale at least 2 withe then if they entered my house no problem I have my 12 gauge
[comment]So what do you do when you run out of ammo after shooting back at the popo? This is when logic just crushes your entire argument
[comment]Given what happened here I wanted to clear up what is happening in Minneapolis. What happened last night was that the rioters were going into porches and pretending to live in some of the houses. This doesn’t excuse the behavior but I’m just explaining WHY they ordered her to get inside. 

The media also will not talk about the fact that police officers in Minneapolis were getting shot at and Molotov cocktails were being thrown.
[comment]I'm pro-gun and believe in keeping the government in check, however, you defending your home with a gun when this parade comes to town will get your family killt.
[comment]How would you shooting back have helped this situation?
[comment]I’m okay with the National Guard showing up to try and stop the riots that are hurting and killing people, but this is a step too far, imo.
[comment]Where was this?
[comment]The entire MN police force seems to need retraining...
[comment]When ya act like assholes and loot &amp; burn shit down- that’s the result. Don’t be mad at the national guard or police- be mad at the assholes taking advantage of a situation.
[comment]That’s why we should be fighting to lower taxes on the middle class. All we are doing is giving more power to the government and less power to the people.
[comment]The title is very misleading, it’s implying they are shooting live rounds but it’s just paintballs. Considering people are burning the city to the ground in “protest” it seems like the best thing for everyone
[comment]Or try not burning down the city provoking factions specifically meant to establish order.
[comment]Kill the Nazi police officers on sight. Any officer "following orders" is a threat to civilian lives. They have no capability to think for themselves and no empathy to consider their victims' lives. Everyone needs to get their guns out now or arm up if you don't have any. Set traps around your house if you can.
[comment]We should all know the context of massive riots in Minneapolis.  Along with that, the burning and looting.  They have shelter in place orders and probably curfews.  This stupid woman could have walked in her front door.  That’s all they asked for her to do.  Since she wasn’t cooperating, the got bean bagged.  Sucks to be stupid.
[comment]No, this is when we draw the line, and we start training officers to actually protect and serve
[comment]I wonder *why* they are patrolling in the first place, it couldnt have anything to do with the large scale riots and "peaceful" protests, could it?  I don't think the media brings enough attention to why these thing happen.  It/they only give attention/shame to the governmental effects, and not the "civil" causes.
[comment]We need to organize a counter-protest for the police, build a giant trapdoor underneath it, then drown them all in pepper spray. And also, piss on their graves when they die.
[comment]Cops like these are nothing but Government boot lickers - no different than Nazi Germany!! 
“Just following orders” - Tyrannical cowards.
[comment]Bruh, shooting the cops in retaliation or even brandishing my gun in response is gonna end badly m’kay?
[comment]Yeah cause opening fire on a group of ~20 cops sounds like a great idea!
[comment]They want to be Democrats, they want to be Socialists, they want to be on the left, this shouldn't surprise them.
[comment]This will resort more protests because only in masses can the people stand up.
One individual guy shooting back will just resort in a gunfight. But protests involving thousands is a whole different ballgame.
[comment]Random pallets of bricks are just randomly showing up in downtown Dallas... this isn’t a protest, it’s a well funded insurrection. Governors are activating the National Guard for good reason.
[comment]Were riots nearby this neighborhood?
[comment]I say listen to the police orders to go inside
[comment]Reminds me of Modern Warfare 2. "Fall back to the Burger Town !"
[comment]I’m with you here OP. People seem to forget which side they are on. Anti-authoritarianism is what this is about; not just when it’s in their favor!
[comment]I can assure you opening fire on officers wouldn't help
[comment]It’s almost like the second amendment becomes functionally useless in the presence of actual authoritarianism.
[comment]While I’m not defending the shooting here, they did tell them like 20 times to go inside before firing (plus it seemed like they were using rubber bullets, no intent to kill). I can understand that they want people to go inside to stay safe when people are rioting in the streets, I don’t think that’s unreasonable considering we’ve forced people to stay in their homes over a lot less
[comment]I know this will get a lot of hate but:
A, You see the situation in Minneapolis right now. The police need the situation completely under control. B, They yelled at them several times to get in the house. And C, they were using paintball guns.

I’m completely pro guns but the purpose of the 2nd amendment is not to protect against cops armed with paintball guns trying to control a riot.
[comment]Looks like ANTIFA sitting around planning. The National Guard said go back into your house. ANTIFA had a choice and they chose to disobey the authorities. These looters paid the price. Oh well.
[comment]Get inside sounds fine.
[comment]I actually am a big lefty and came here just to read what everyone on the right was saying right now and I just wanted to contribute that I agree, this is why we need guns, this is what the second amendment is for. There’s clearly an abuse of power by the state happening. Ok bye!! Xoxo
[comment]Folks as bad as it looks, please read the direct quote from the Curfew page and realize they are within their right as officers to do what they did.

Can I be outside my house (on my property) after 8 p.m. and before 6 a.m.?

Yes. You can be on your porch, yard, patio, etc., but if a law enforcement officer or other public safety official asks you to go inside, or take any other action, you must follow the instruction.<|endoftext|>

[comment]You know, maybe she reached into her past, her father was a decent man, or maybe she just got tired of being a shill for the Democrats. O feel like I went back in time with this interview.

Don’t be surprised if Billary gets called in from the Bullpen.
[comment]One part of this story bothers me.  If I filed a report 1) I would ask for a copy and 2) I would know the name of who I reported it to.

Obviously, innocent until proven guilty in the USA if Democrat, but guilty until proven innocent if a Republican.

The hypocrisy is amazing, but again this part seems odd to me.

[comment]There will be a crisis over this. The party will twist and turn and finally put forth a candidate who has no chance.
[comment]What's wild is that people are saying Mika "pushed" Biden in this interview. She didn't ask him about the "hugs, kisses, and touching that women said made them uncomfortable." stuff that the NY Times tweeted and then later removed, she doesn't ask about the Larry King Live video, etc.

Biden says the University of Delaware stuff can't be released because it has records pertaining to his job like his positions on topics and interviews. She should have asked why the public cannot see, as Biden says, "...all of those things relating to my job."

This was a pretty softball interview overall
[comment]It’s hard to comprehend how hypocritical Biden is about his secrecy talking to foreign leaders when Biden and the left demand to know what was said and investigate Trump every time time he utters a word to any foreign leader.
[comment]so... don't release the records because they show my record and that can become "fodder"...

is he not proud of his record?

[comment]Even if those records don't have anything to do with Reed there is obviously something in those records he doesn't want to be seen.

[comment]It would be funny to watch if it wasn’t so sad
[comment]R/Politics says this isn’t a trial and it’s a job interview when Kavanaugh got accused so no due process is needed. Biden is interviewed for a job so he doesn’t need due process.

<|startoftext|>[title]The truth
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/ptea613ima251.jpg[comment]They aren't entirely wrong, but your point is certainly spot on.

There are clearly actors that are not part of the group instigating violence. It seems antifa is indeed acting within these protests. However, BLM is not quite the calm and peaceful protest group they claim to be and they are certainly not all about racial equality. When your group blocks traffic and chants that the only good cop is a dead cop, then yeah, your group might kind of suck. Or if you say "no justice, no peace" meanwhile the person you are angry with is facing justice and being held on $500,000 bail while awaiting a trial for murder, then maybe you are protesting for a silly reason. Maybe nationwide protests aren't necessary. This wasn't Rodney King with cops blatantly beating a guy up. This was a dumb ass cop who was not following protocol.
[comment]Every republican ive talked to was an idiot. All republicans are idiots 🖕
[comment]BLM is a foreign funded insurgency. The BLM goons are out there to sow the seeds of discontent and gin up race hatred. If they were protesting hoping to make the world peaceful, they would not be advocating for vandals and looters and rioters.

A serial killer spends most of his time not stacking bodies, but no one cares about his downtime. People only care that there are bodies left over when the killer goes to work. BLM doesn't loot or rob or riot or burn business all the time. Sometimes they are too busy dragging people out of their cars and lynching them in the street.
[comment]Except that protesters are regular citizens who may not have the authority, training, or physical ability to stop violent actors around them. 

Police officers do have the authority, training, physical ability, and even gear to stop violence, so when they fail to stop other officers who are acting with violence or corruption it is fair to paint them with the same brush.
[comment]This is kind of a strawman that you're making here. Clearly not all protesters think ALL cops are bad, and we've seen clear evidence of that.
[comment]The protestors do not believe all cops are bad, rather they want to good cops to weed out the bad. They know most cops aren't bad.
[comment]I appreciate everyone here having a respectful and knowledgable debate, instead of just throwing around profanities and name calling. We don't all have to agree on everything but we can still respect each other🙌

[comment]No one polices the police. They get away with 10x more than any normal person. It's a pretty brutal difference. They should be held to a MUCH HIGHER standard than civilians, or they don't need that MUCH HIGHER authority.
[comment]Its a turd in the punchbowl situation for both sides.
[comment]Honestly I see the logic considering the protestors have been [seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/instantkarma/comments/gug5kf/peaceful_protest_not_raging_riots/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  actively turning the rioters to the police. The day the cops turn the tucked up ones in is when it’ll be equal
[comment]Do you fail to see the hypocrisy in this comment? The right has been telling us for years that "not all cops are bad and it's a few bad apples." Meanwhile, anytime there's misconduct, all the body cams are magically dead, the "investigation" always determines there's no wrongdoing, and the thin blue line lies to protect the officers involved.

[comment]Playing devil's advocate: the cops are the ones who have the power, while protestors don't, so they can't be compared like this. But yea, whoever says all cops are bad are just trying to stir up trouble rather than protesting.
[comment]I don’t see that is their claim at all, I don’t think BLM thinks all cops are bad but cops enforce a an unjust system of law, so yes cops are bad they chose to enforce the laws of a corrupted system. The police state IS the problem.
[comment]Yeah but the protesters aren’t killing people every single day
[comment]The difference is it isn't the job of the peaceful protestors to stop rioters. It IS the job of good cops to stop bad cops.

The saying isn't "one bad apple makes the whole barrel LOOK bad" it is "one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel."

I don't think most cops are bad people, but I DO think most cops are bad cops. At least in the big cities. There are degrees of bad. The cops that use excessive force, frame people and are on the take are certainly the worst of them. And I think in most jurisdictions they are in the minority. However, the cops that cover for the worst cops, or look the other way when they see wrong doing are also bad cops, and that kind of bad cop seems to be in the majority of large city police forces. 

And that isn't me playing holier than thou. If I were a cop I probably wouldn't have the courage to turn in the bad cops either, which would make me a bad cop and thus not suited for the job.

[comment]I personally don’t mind riots so long as they’re not geared towards innocent business owners, and more geared towards police stations, and I wouldn’t normally even be OK with riots, it’s just the whole battle between police brutality over 200 years
[comment]But yes, that is their logic, and it’s rarted
[comment]I mean the protest is that the system keeps letting this happen but sure, you believe that
[comment]As one user pointed out, this is a strawman. Moreover, I think people are protesting the tendencies of police departments to protect their police officers so as to not damage the public relations within their community. Just look at the statement

https://web.archive.org/web/20200526121443/https://www.insidempd.com/2020/05/26/man-dies-after-medical-incident-during-police-interaction/

"he appeared to be suffering medical distress"

Yes, for them it is a race issue, but nonetheless it is still a police brutality issue.
[comment]The issue they are protesting is that the small group of bad cops are protected from persecution when they misbehave
[comment]If you‘re still supporting the cops you‘re farther deranged than Ben Garrison. Just saying.
[comment]The protestors themselves acknowledge this though, and do not associate or try to protect these rioters. 

There isnt such an acknowledgement within the police force. Would a good man harboring a fugitive not also be legally responsible and charged?

Edit: a word
[comment]Republicans: you can't say all gun owners are violent when it's only a VERY SMALL group being violent! The majority of us use guns for peaceful things! 

Also Republicans: there are a few bad protesters out there so ALL protesters are bad!!

See the fallacy in "the truth" of your post?
[comment]I always thought school was dumb for trying to teach "critical thinking". Like, how hard is it to just think things through? When I see posts like these, I realize I was wrong to criticize.
[comment]Remember, these are the same people who say everything is relative like morality and identity. We’ve seen Democrats blatantly lie in order to advance their political agenda or ignore context and facts. The logic of the left is just sad
[comment]The problem is the cops get paid no matter who or how they kill.
[comment]This really isn't a political issue. You can support good cops and still support these protests. The issue stems from the fact that bad cops are not being punished severely enough. That Asian police officer should have told his fellow officer to get off his neck and helped him get up so they could just arrest him rather than stand there to defend his fellow officer. I don't know what went through in his mind but any sensible officer would have noticed that Floyd was in any way a danger to anyone. My brother-in-law is a cop. He damn sure ain't letting a co-worker of his do that in front of him. I respect the work a police officer does but it's not difficult to spot bad cops when you're around then unless you're also a bad cop.
[comment]Isn't the difference that the protesters are calling out the bad protesters for doing bad things while police officers don't call each other out for doing bad things like murder unarmed people?
[comment]Well you can argue that some bad protesters make the whole protest wrong while agreeing that some bad cops make an unjust system.

Or

There are some bad protesters, but there are some bad police. Not everybody is defined by the mistakes of the few.

You’d be a hypocrite to believe that one group is all bad because of some bad examples while believing the opposing force simply has a few bad apples.

In a nutshell, the kind of person you are is to either blame the whole, blame the guilty, or you’re an asshole just trying to rage

Thanks for coming to my ted talk:)
[comment]It’s already been said but there’s bad people on both sides. But there’s a systemic problem here that happens all the time, and it’s not rioting.

Latino? But not all...
[comment]Which one is it
[comment]Two signs I saw from protesters that were extremely troubling. One said abolish the police. I’m like you need some organization to enforce the law or you have anarchy. The second was all policemen are klansmen. I mean cmon a lot of police officers are black or other minorities. This is an egregious overstatement. There are racist cops but a small minority. No one will take you seriously if you say stupid shit like that
[comment]They are protesting a systemic problem, not demonizing all police. If you're still denying the validity of the BLM movement you are part of the problem.
[comment]Almost like protesters didn't take an oath to protect and serve and then go around killing people who can't fight back with impunity or something.
[comment]I don’t think anyone thinks all cops are bad. Even if it’s a small percentage (1% let’s say), that’s still a hell of a lot of bad cops.

The bigger problem is not the bad cops themselves, but the system that allows these cops to continue working, not face retribution, and the “good” cops protect them. The good cops need to weed the bad ones out of the force.
[comment]Maybe they should have sent the national guard to deal with the “small” percentage of bad cops before rioting began.
[comment]Protesters are exercising a constitutional right. Rioters are not. Good cops follow the rule of law and protect individuals constitutional and legal rights. Bad cops break the law in their enforcement, and violate individuals constitutional rights, or simply look the other way.
[comment]Most cops are good, most protesters are good. Bad cops are terrible. Rioters are also terrible. We can condemn both.
[comment]this is not true
[comment]Of course, protesters aren't armed by the state and given qualified immunity for their actions, as well as being protected by a corrupt union.
[comment]Literally makes no sense.

Protesters do not necessarily form coherent group. There is no "protest leader" that can stop bad people from joining in the protest, there is no such leader that can reprimand or at least denounce the "bad" who associate with them. (I will add, if there is a head of such a movement, then yes, anybody who still willingly associate with such a movement is bad.)

Police do form groups, and there are indeed leaders that decided to hire or not bad people from joining. Those leaders can too reprimand and denounce the "bad" who associate with them. In fact, they can fire them. Therefore, a few bad cops not being fired necessarily does mean the group is bad.
[comment]This is a strawman  because the movement isn't saying all cops are bad, it's saying the system of policing is bad. If cops give into general stereotypes based on experience or preconceived notions or bias, they may make a mistake. The system is designed to sweep that mistake under the rug, this results in general mistrust which creates a divide between a community and the policing system, which starts the cycle.
The protest is about ending the cycle and the only way that can happen is if more accountability is legislated. That is the movement in a nutshell.

I personally feel cops should get a huge pay increase akin to doctors, especially with all they do and put up with. The caveat, if you make a mistake in arresting or shooting someone who by the court of law is found not guilt of the crime accused, then the cop should be fired after judicial review. There can be a demerit system before termination that involves paying hefty fines as well as suspension without pay to offset minor or first time offenses, but it basically treats an officer with the same benefit/cost of being a doctor
[comment]Man, hundreds of people burning one city (multiply this by the amount of cities being trashed) is clearly only a few protesters and they clearly aren’t joining in on things
[comment]I swear this would have been great 2 weeks ago when society allowed you to live in your own bubble and think every POC was lying about police issues but now if that’s how you feel then so be it
[comment]Well who’s Fault is that ?
[comment]We have to get them to achieve more in school.
[comment]Thats not an apples to apples comparison. The problem's with the system/culture that's ingrained into the police. That doesn't make the individuals themselves bad or corrupt. The protestors are not an organized force, so it's easy for somebody who wants to take advantage of the situation and infiltrate peaceful protests to cause mayhem and loot. Nobody's infiltrating the police so the comparison is just wrong period.
[comment]Hypocrites: A few bad apples doesn't mean that all police are bad
Also hypocrites: There are few people taking advantage of the protests to loot and riot. ALL PROTESTERS ARE LOOTERS AND RIOTERS.<|endoftext|>

Over 30,000 people have already died from the virus, and over 600,000 are sick. This protest is completely pointless and dangerous. When the pandemic is over then go protest.

[comment]Literally they should stay inside. They have every right to protest when this is over.
[comment]During a virus epidemic protesting is a non essential activity according to the police department, one of the rising problems during this time is how can you limit the citizen without taking his rights . I think it's not the right thing to do, giving away natural right for a little bit of protection is a false way of thinking.
[comment]Mind repeating that in German?
[comment]They might want to read that Constitution thingy and rhe Bill of Rights. We are not under martial law. Our rights do not go away because some politician issues a decree.

[comment]Guys. Even if it is a violation of the constitution, people shouldn’t be out there in the first place. A small few people defying common sense and protesting in the middle of a pandemic is just plain dumb. This is just the kind of bait that democrats use to slander us. Don’t be stupid.

[comment]So let me get this right, the government creates an unconstitutional bill and see no retalition from the people. Once they knew about it, they protested against the tyrannical government and their move was "protesting is non essential" How about the gov sit their ass down and do whats nessassary. The stimulas package should've only covered the hospital and the lost pay due to the governors shutting business down. There is no need to send millions, let alone billions of dollars to corporations and funding democrat's  idiotic agenda from the past 10 to 20 years. Explain to me why Nancy Polosi need millions to fund gun control from the stimulus package? Will anyone bother explaining me this.
[comment]What if the prohibition (on protesting) was temporary for let's say six more weeks. What about three months? Six months? A year?

Temporary is pretty subjective.

[comment]This is one thing I can never get behind with Republican subreddits. I’m very conservative fiscally but fighting over something like abortion really hurts our image to the general public.

It doesn’t make sense that so many conservatives are so gung ho on keeping firearms unregulated but also all for regulating abortion. It would make sense that we would be against regulations on both, no? If we want to preach how regulations don’t work and just make things worse with firearms that logic should really carry over to abortion. Much like how if guns are illegal people will still obtain them, people will still get abortions through more unsafe means if abortion is made illegal. The only thing defunding planned parenthood does is hurt women. They do a lot more than provide abortions. Increasing access to birth control methods is by no means a bad thing, and if anything their services in that area REDUCE the amount of abortions provided.
[comment]Well the ones being killed are still in the womb. The others are living children who can spread a virus that kills people. Also, planned parenthood does do lots of other medical things other then abortions. I remember as a younger man going there to get an STD test. I personally wouldn't want my children in a classroom. Heck when it's cold and flu season they all get sick. Keeping them safe and schools closed is the smart thing.
[comment]To be fair the public education system is slag.
[comment]At least they’re not being brainwashed at public screwools!
[comment]This is a dumb meme. Sure, abortion is bad. It’s pretty much the main issue that informs my voting. At the same time, I’m a teacher and I’m worker harder now than ever before to try and get a bunch of high schoolers to have a solid foundation in chemistry. I’m working harder than ever to help guide the juniors assigned to me for college counseling.
[comment]Seriously though this argument is not sound and has absolutely no grounds. Get gud.
[comment]bad take. planned parenthood is for all sorts of sex things. std’s, pregnancy preventions, it’s not really just abortions. and schools aren’t open because that’s about 2000 people in an enclosed space together for 8 hours, not great for covid-19 prevention.
[comment]Come on dude if we send kids back to school this virus is gonna be twice as worse, all it takes is one person to get it and boom hundreds at the school are gonna have it and pass it on to others
[comment]All you conservatives couldn't care less about real children your just a cult of fetus worshipping hypocrites who will surely rot in hell.
[comment]I mean they’re not wrong
[comment]If it wasn't so anti-Islam, the Republican party would be hugely popular among the majority of Muslims.

[comment]"Educating" Is a generous word. Have you seen these new curriculums?
[comment]“i support the reopening of schools!” 😐
[comment]According to libs both are slaughter houses for kids
[comment]So many downvotes and no explanations. Weird.
[comment]If you can’t educate them, might as well kill them.
[comment]It would be nice if each PP had a customers-served tracker like McDonalds, "Over one million choices to rip unborn babies apart limb from limb made here!"
[comment]Public schools should always be considered nonessential, planned parenthood being terrible has nothing to do with it.
[comment]Funny thing is... if we got rid of planned parenthood, we would have a huge spike in abortions due to how many pregnancies they prevent. Also in 15+ years there would be an enormous increase in crime.
[comment]Fuxking libtards
[comment]As a conservative, this is a very retarded and unfair assessment. Thank you
[comment]I’m glad this crap meme got crushed.
[comment]Memes like these make Republicans look like jackasses
[comment]Me who enjoys not going to school
[comment]This whole comment section is complete shit
[comment]Are there any conservatives like me who are pro-choice?  I've personally never liked anything pro-life.
[comment]Who said people were against education of children, 

Learn online people, kids carrying virus are not so much healthy. 
No one will stop kids going to stop sending kids to school.. until then like every other 150+ countries stay home
[comment]How about close both, along with closing gun stores?
[comment]More education is probably occurring now with those brainwashing centers closed down. I have no problem with this.
[comment]Bruh who is against the education of children
[comment]Republicans and their lack of logic and critical thinking skills
[comment]To those out there who think flattening the curve is the cure:

Flattening the curve isn't going to stop the virus.  Too many people keep thinking that the lock down is going to be the cure to stop the virus when the curve is flattened. That's not how this works or has worked or will work.

It's simply helping ease the virus infection rate that *is* going to occur to the same number of people as though we hadn't quarantined. That's the whole point. Expect to get it at some point (if you haven't already had it, and were asymptomatic).

The curve flattening was to help our health system stay on top of it and keep from being over-burdened. It's inevitable that everyone's going to get it eventually. That's an established fact. (again if you haven't already had it and didn't realize it, like the going theory is out in CA)

There *will* likely be a spike in cases for a short (emphasis) period as people start to get back to life and states  (and frankly other countries) start phasing in re-opening their economies, but over time as things warm up, and as immunities build up, the cases will drop.
[comment]Wasn't it the Republican party that under cuts educational programs and after school programs. As I can also recall most red states have been dealing with teacher strikes since they are underpaid and overworked... (only saying since I'm in a red state and my wife is a teacher) so educational standards are not a main priority for Republicans, but controlling women's freedoms and denying them the right to choose is definitely a priority.
[comment]Schools are concentrated areas with hundreds and thousands of kids and planned parenthood has a lot less people at a time and they don't only do abortions they have other functions. I am a Republican btw.
[comment]Insert: Meme about republicans wanting to save all the unborn babies regardless of circumstances, but wanting citizens to die for the economy during a pandemic (quote: Chris Christie, Ken Paxton, etc).
[comment]You probably don't have a family or kids so I wouldn't expect you to understand why someone wouldn't want send their kids to school right now. I don't blame you, I blame your parents.
[comment]Schools are still open they’re just doing on line. Schools are a hotbed for disease, so it makes a lot of sense to do it online
[comment]Yes, I bet you think grouping all of our children into small areas for 7 hours a day during a pandemic is a great idea, don’t you? You’re the type that gives us a bad name.
[comment]You are so full of shit

[comment]I like how she lectures governments about the environment while people are out there cleaning up the Earth and she isn't.
[comment]Could you guys please stop talking about Thunberg as a person and start talking about actual politics?
[comment]I don't understand this opinion. She's an activist. She has rallied all over the world for people to listen to and push the words of the real experts in climate science.  And she's been incredibly successful in her goal.  To make people pay attention to those who do know what they're talking about. These two kids have totally different objectives they're tackling
[comment]How dare you!!!
[comment]Ocean plastic and climate change are different issues. Fighting climate change requires policy changes since we need to reduce carbon emission in the future. Boyan's method to clean up plastic waste attacks part of that problem but not all of the plastic in the ocean ends up in the garbage patches. The only way to really combat the problem with plastic in the ocean is policy changes.
[comment]She’s an actress, just like AOC
[comment]Frodo?
[comment]we got a slut and a slat on that picture
[comment]Ladies and gentlemen, please report the trolls, do not feed them.

That was the real problem
[comment]Isn’t she retarded? That’s gotta get her some lunch xtra points
[comment]The guy on the right was also celebrated but just another ocean clean up start up isn't going to do anything when everytime a fighter needs to land on a US carrier it dumps all it's fuel in the ocean.
Greta is holding the world leaders accountable which is what we should be doing, not just praise a kid for inventing something that won't be widely implemented because he doesn't have the money.

The left is a cesspool of victimhood.

[comment]Had to jump for my daily karma deduction. Those people are literally the dumbest people on earth.
[comment]Maybe we all need to mount up and ride in...flooding it with unbiased truth?
[comment]Victim complex? Two words: Ahmaud Arbery
[comment]That’s how I got -99 karma....
[comment]It's always been that way for the ~9 years I've been using reddit.
[comment]There is some next level projecting going on in that thread, but what astounds me is the complete lack of awareness that they have. They are doing exactly what they claim the right is doing right in the comment section!
[comment]Holy fuck I just lost brain cells reading that...

I also lost karma downvoting it.
[comment]You're posting this onto a self described partisan subreddit, literally an echo chamber for the right. What's your point?
[comment]Lack of constructive dialogue is making these people dumb.
[comment]Groupthink and confirmation bias. If you want a dose of that, head over to r/politics
[comment]I didn't read passed the first sentence.
[comment]The only reason why I am even on this subreddit is to balance out the bullshit. Seriously according to these people anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders is Hitler.
[comment]I lost a few brain cells scrolling down that sub
[comment]Another lefty article whining because people won't do what their "superiors" tell them to do. :yawn:
[comment]I'm on the left pretty hard and even this is too much for me.
[comment]I’m rocking about 45 downvoted at the moment for politely pointing out that they’re the ones that are obsessed with race. Worth. Every. Downvote.
[comment]Coming from the people who think every criticism against them is a personal attack and that the world is rigged against them
[comment]R/politics just needs to be renamed to r/Democrats or something of the latter
[comment]This is what we call projection
[comment]This is just the left doing what they always do - accusing us of doing something they are doing themselves.
[comment]That’s reddit in general
[comment]Every time I post in there, I lose about 200 karma.  More than worth it to spread a little honesty into their one-sided lives.
[comment]It's funny, politics became the even worse than the opposite of T_D, yet is featured on /all, and is seen as the haven for politics.  It continues to go further and further down the drain.  A year ago huffpost was the most left source. Now it's a central cite.

I wonder how it will look come November.
[comment]Isn't there an argument for cases per million?

Be interrogative about one thing on r/politics and get reamed in the comment section
[comment]I don't know how they can't hear their own hypocrisy
[comment]What does that even mean? And even if it were true, how is that relevant right now? It's not even news. (To be clear, I'm talking about the r/politics post, not this one)
[comment]r/politics is a hive mentality cult
[comment]I don’t understand why the left hates Christians so much. I’m not the most catholic person ever but I’d never tell anyone that their religion is wrong. Why can’t people practice what they want.
[comment]I made the mistake of reading the comments of that post. Apparently conservatives thrive on “persecution” and are all insane hateful Christians.

I’m relatively new to reddit and when I joined, I followed r/politics for quite some time, thinking it would be somewhere I could keep up with unbiased news and good discussion. I quickly realized how wrong I was. So now I’m here.
[comment]I guess not wanting to be constantly gaslit is considered a victimhood complex ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
[comment]When looking for this sub, I found r/RepublicanValues, which is basically just a leftist echo chamber that strawmans the right as a bunch of Nazis and confederate sympathizers. Leftists literally control Reddit, as evident by there being no r/DemocratValues, but do me a favor and downvote their posts with me and spread truth among their lies

Edit: Apparently r/DemocratValues does exist, but it's much smaller and is just a sub that actually praises Democratic values instead of critiquing them. My point still stands
[comment]Who talks like this? It’s like they get off rooting for America’s downfall.
[comment]No different then here, I'm happy to bash on Pelosi or Boxer (they and plenty of others on the left) or plenty of things Obama has done.  But watch me get downvoted to oblivion because Mitch needs to go too.  You guys will defend him till the end as he sells you out just like most Dems will do for Pelosi.
[comment]I can’t stand that subreddit, I’ve tried to talk to left wings many times but all they do is insult me and tell me I should go die, so I stay far away from them. I don’t remember that kind of hostility when Obama was in office, and I was in grade school when Bush was president so I don’t remember or know how that atmosphere was
[comment]Yeah but if you join this sub, Reddit starts pushing some extremely right subs like pro-life
[comment]I get downvoted to hell for replies like this:

"Social networks today are primary replacement of public forums, they perform same function, have much larger reach, and are more convenient. So, if such network claims they are a platform, they are supposed to follow US laws that protect free speech. Most of the current social networks are more like public utilities when they claim to be platforms. When people analyze things that are being censored, clear pattern is seen which points to a bias towards left on all major platforms. There are many double standards in enforcing the terms and conditions, depending on political leanings of the content in question. This is very unfair, unhealthy, and promotes division among people. Doesn't take a genius to see how bad this is, but giant companies keep using all possible loopholes in the courts in order to avoid facing the consequences of claiming being either a publisher or a platform depending on the case."
[comment]I go in that one every now n then.  Just to say.
" Yup I found out where the Snowflakes are"
Lol
[comment]I have negative karma because It took me a few days to realize Its just a Democratic Subreddit
[comment]They went on a whole rant how Sen. Rand Paul is a self-certified doctor, but not a real board certified doctor. Talk about fake news.
[comment]I notice all of their posts have multiple awards. Is that because the leftists spend lots of real $ on Reddit and we’re smarter with our cash? Or is it Reddit blocking us from even awarding our posts?
[comment]I just said r/politics needs to be renamed r/spewanythingforkaramamining
[comment]The left do love their strawmen. The buck toothed, maga  hat wearing, illiterate yokel, "praying to his orange God" 5 times a day. They attack this imaginary person all day long
[comment]It is literally just that.. Just comment thread after comment thread of neck beard mouth breathers stoking each other egos. It is literal cancer.
[comment]They're easy to argue against. They just can't handle being treated the exact way that they treat others.
[comment]Also read as: "*crying* I got downvoted for being an asshole."
[comment]I've just decided to ignore it. Its not worth the negative karma or time.
[comment]i have never seen such a long article that states nothing but opinion with no fact to back it up. this is our problem. where is the corroborating evidence?

[comment]The Donald was the only thing left that was keeping this place from eating itself alive, now they have to hate each other.
[comment]WTF kind of article is that? 🤣 The Left always plays the victim card. The race card. They invent crap like "White Privilege " and a gender gap just so they can pretend to be victims.
[comment]Conservative victim hood? They really just project all of their own stuff onto their opponents to feel better about themselves don't they.
[comment]"&gt; It was likely inevitable that the pandemic would get sucked into the hysteria industrial complex, because that's what right-wing media does with everything.

The best line of the whole article."

This is exactly what the left does with EVERYTHING! How do they do deeply lack any self awareness?
[comment]I don’t often see good responses against the points they’re making in that thread though? How do I know they’re not right about it
[comment]Yeah those libs love their echo chambers. Let me just post and complain about that on a subreddit of people that all agree and think like me.
[comment]Disgusting
[comment]"Why do these people we censor and constantly shit on throughout the media feel oppressed?" -- liberals, probably.

I really have a hard time seeing their behavior as anything but outright evil these days. They know they're persecuting people, they just think those people deserve it, so they shouldn't have a right to complain about the psychosis the media exhibits toward conservatism. They don't think constantly insulting people all over television, in every movie, in books and in all of their coastal 'comedy' acts counts for some reason--and keep in mind, these are people who want to make insulting minorities illegal.
[comment]Reddit over the last 5 years has gone extremely left just take a peak at /r/coronavirus
[comment]Pretty sure there are quite a few bots over there.

[comment]how did we allow it to become this????
[comment]I’m fairly new to reddit and my first decision was to comment a few of my republican viewpoints on r/politics, you can tell by my karma what happened.
[comment]One common claim in that thread is that disagreement isn’t allowed in r/conservative. 

It just isn’t true. I’ve had spirited debates within the subreddit many times.

[comment]This is what JP calls being ideologically possessed.
[comment]So a crime against a woman, which is illegal,  as long as it's someone who the liberal left  want b/c they hate Trump so much. Since Trump isn't supported by those people, a criminal must get into the White House at all costs...regardless if he committed a crime.   I don't care what party you as a politician fall under,  if you have someone come against you with a crime, why can't it be handled the same way it would be handled if it was one of us?  Such as we would be arrested, either put in jail or post bail, there would be an investigation, court, and a judge and jury decides if you're guilty or not.  Why is it different for the ruling politicians, regardless of what party they support.  Why is any crime overlooked in DC if you ask me. It's a joke honestly.
[comment]No. It was never about MeToo or believing women.  It was always and only about power.
[comment]Ok two can play at that, I beleive all the women who accused Trump and Kavanaugh, but I still want them in Office..
[comment]I wonder if they think Tara Reade has to vote for Biden?
[comment]They don’t give a shit about women, it’s all about power and beating trump whatever the cost, I hope centrists and independents observe this.
[comment]God damn if only the DNC could get somebody normal. In my personal opinion I want Donald Trump in office, but to see this go down is terrible, and I hope that in a generation or two most Americans will understand what was going on.
[comment]Ok then "believing" her means absolutely nothing, it's just a thing you say, that's all, there are no consequences except someone will "believe"
[comment]Next level TDS
[comment]For those women who are ok with this being a fact and you are still voting for Biden, he really wants to hire all of you
[comment]Gotta give it up to them for being honest. Still shitty double standard though.
[comment]People with these sentiments are going to regret saying this. It may not be tomorrow or even next year, but some day these words will come back to haunt these people good and hard.   
     
    
Seasons and tastes change, what seems fiercely urgent now will rot like milk. This trend of believing the accuser while voting for the perpetrator is going to leave lasting damage to the agenda of the left.    
   
The Dems need a mission. Their mission was social justice, but that is shown to be a farce. How are they going to woo the independent voter now?    
   
If the dems had just taken a prudent and thought out strategy they could've easily defeated Trump. They are stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. They need a campaign strategy that speaks to the common middle-of-the-road American. They need to cut the hard, edgy activists out and focus on small compromises that will peel Trump's supporters away. Everything they do alienates these voters.   
   
Think about the miners and and factory workers that mother jones organized and unionized in the early 20th century. Those peasants would have no quarter in today's Democrat party. They believed in Christian-based family values, in a strong nation and in second amendment rights.  The left has abandoned this kind of American.  
  
So, in short, the way to defeat Trump is to compromise a little and win these Americans back to the left, not supporting sex predators.
[comment]Not surprised even a little bit.
[comment]This is disgusting. Not unexpected perhaps, but disgusting. I'm still giving Joe the benefit of the doubt as he deserves, but they say they believe he's a rapist yet want him to beat Trump anyways?
[comment]What sane woman would vote Democrat at this point 

[ rhetorical,  we know there are no sane female Democrats]
[comment]"oRaNge MaN bAd!"
[comment]Moral bankruptcy of the left
[comment]They have no shame. It does not surprise me.
[comment]They also believe the many Trump accusers, and the reasoning behind is that if you have to choose between a crappy meal and actual crap, you eat that meal, no matter how crappy it is.
[comment]So they just admitted that none of this #metoo crap had anything to do with justice for women.
[comment]Lost cause. Ignore them and focus on people that still have a chance.
[comment]The left showing once again that they will sacrifice their morals if it means winning.

So desperate..
[comment]Mental illness should not be encouraged and stupidity is not a superpower.
[comment]So Bret Kavanagh is all good now. Glad we cleared that up.
[comment]The DNC is awful and corrupt and I’m not a fan of joe Biden. Having said that, the choice is between someone who has been accused by one woman, or the current president who has been accused by 20+ women. It’s not unreasonable to still vote for Biden when these are your only options.
[comment]That’s honestly disgusting
[comment]Just proves #metoo only works if the person is a republican. It could come out that Biden was just as bad as Jerry Sandusky and people would still vote for him. The silence from the me too movement is deafening.
[comment]Honestly I think you shouldn’t be able to report it 5 years after it happened especially if the person has became famous or rich
[comment]Gotta cheer for the team no matter what.
[comment]It’s (D)ifferent when we do it!
[comment]Joe Biden's support for abortion outweighs any past misdeeds for feminists.
[comment]This makes it clear that the Kavanaugh situation had nothing to do with believing women or caring about sexual assault. They found a guy they didn't like and did everything they could to destroy him. They didn't care with Bill Clinton and they don't care now with Joe Biden. I hope the American people can see through their bull shit.
[comment]Can’t fix stupid!!
[comment]Liberals are pathetic
[comment]"I'm uh Joe Biden, and I forgot this message" he will gets tons of votes because he perfectly relates to his voters...
[comment]I cant wait for the debates. Gonna be a real shitshow. Get the popcorn out.
[comment]I love this picture for 1 reasons: shows a liberal being an idiot
2: it's from an android
[comment]The hypocrisy
[comment]This is the reality we have to deal with. Liberals operate on a different set of morals. Trully vile creatures.
[comment]All of them are shit
[comment]Well if you have to pick a sexual assailant for president, you may as well pick the one who matches you ideologically
[comment]That's literally supporting a rapist and they hate Trump for saying "grab her by the pussy" _bruh_
[comment]It's called the lesser of two evils, if it were up to me I would vote for jeo biden, have Congress impeach and remove him. I don't like democrats or Republicans, feel like this whole 2 party system is the thing dividing America and I feel like both parties hold too much power.
[comment]At least she's honest.
[comment]I mean this is how all people are. You see it all over the place. People idolize politicians when they should be holding them accountable.
[comment]You can stand for anything when you’re spineless statist commie
[comment]In no way do I support Joe biden, ESPECIALLY after this but I feel like everyone here is forgetting the 25 people that have brought to light Trumps sexual misconducts. They are both horrible people at this point its about who people think is worse. I do agree the double standard here is a bit ridiculous, Biden should definitely be held accountable by the people that support him.
[comment]Well the convict did commit mass murder, but he has a dog so lets just give it to a Texas salon owner.
[comment]Honest question, do you guys think sexual assault should disqualify someone from holding public office?
[comment]“I am voting for Biden. But I am so sorry he sexually assaulted you. I believe you but he’s our guy.” Follow the blue, don’t think for yourself. Maybe they should change it to #metoonotsomuchyou.
[comment]She just summed up the left in 160 characters.
[comment]They manipulate everything to their convenience. People are slowly catching on and figuring out how stupid the left is.
[comment]No, they aren't, but on the bright side at least they're completely owning their hypocrisy and exposing themselves to everyone else, especially the moderates. They've gone full retard and it's not a good look.
[comment]This doesn't just make them hypocrites, it makes them look stupid.
[comment]No, they're not joking, just depraved. They are liberals, after all.
[comment]I’m as concerned if not more so about creepy joe’s relationship with China. If you think he’s gonna be the nominee, I can’t see the Dems putting forth a nomination for the poor guy. He’s become a sympathetic character. If I we’re a betting man I don’t think he’ll be the nominee
[comment]These people are pathetic
[comment]“I have no ethics.”
[comment]That article is straight up cancer, justifying voting for a sex offenders entry into office because he'd do more for women there than "the worst president in the history of the republic". She's got the mental faculties of Biden at this stage...
[comment]If it weren’t for double standards, the left would have no standards at all.
[comment]Top comment is splitting hairs, no? The pussy grab is exactly what people are considering. We know he said it, furthermore I believe he conducted himself this way. Biden likely too.

Even anecdotally, in ref to my vote, it is my vote to be swayed, not a criminal accusation with burdens of proof. 

So if they’re both disgusting in reference to women, the other factors play out and this gets ignored.
[comment]Of course they are because the me too movement was full of shit.
[comment]It's actually not that difficult of a concept. Given the option of two rapists, you vote for the rapist that's the least bad. You guys are voting for the rapist with an (R) next to his name, so you have no right to judge people who vote for Biden. They're doing the same thing you are.
[comment]What a lot of people don’t seem to grasp is that most Democrats believe all of Trumps accusers are telling the truth and that the infamous grab em by the pussy tape is an actual confession of sexual assault.  So it’s literally voting between 2 sex offenders for president.  And if you use that logic, Biden has raped less women than Trump.  

Just gonna put that out there and say that I’m not a Republican, but I like to try to understand the assumptions people have.
[comment]It would help if we all recognize that the primary process as it currently works is failing all around (not just Dems).  We are in transition from a time when stage one of the primary process occurred out of sight before a single vote is cast, to a time when voters are given more opportunity to select from a much wider field of candidates.  The flip side of this is that in a field with a large the number of strong candidates, the winner might prevail with a small plurality, and could even be opposed by a large majority within their own party.

With that said, here's the view from the other side:

In the highly likely event that Biden is the nominee, I will face a choice between

* Candidate B:  one credible accusation of assault and known behavior that has made some women uncomfortable,  but supports many of my policy preferences and has demonstrated experience in legislative and executive governance.
* Candidate T: many accusations of assault, admitted to sexual assault as a basic way of interacting with women in certain settings, admitted to using ownership of the Miss Universe Pageant as an excuse for walking in on naked teens, also supports few if any of my policy preferences and has demonstrated incompetence in response to a global crisis.

Where is the hypocrisy here in pulling the level for Candidate B, if this is what the choice looks like from my side of the aisle?

[comment]Let’s appoint some IGs so we can make sure the Bailout money is going where it’s supposed to.

But we need a National response, not just piece mailing individual states responses.
[comment]Agreed

[comment]Accurate.
[comment]This is me, absolute destruction of a global economy is coming, and it scares the shit out of me.
[comment]One of my friends thinks that the virus is fake bc he’s never seen a human with it
[comment]I feel entirely too validated by OP and the top comment. (‘Petty tyrants’)
[comment]They aren't letting a crisis go to waste.  Trillion dollar spending spree?  Massive authoritarian crackdown they will only partially retreat from?  A politician in a crisis is a kid in a candy store.
[comment]It's certainly possible to believe all three, but that doesn't really change the fact that we need to maintain our social distancing policies for a while longer.

It's fair to be concerned about the state of the economy, but it will get better once the crisis has passed and we can all go outside and start buying things again. Dead people can't participate in commerce, so we're better off in the long run by focusing on minimizing infection rates.

It's fair to be concerned about authoritarian power grabs, but millions of Americans could die if we're not careful about this, as opposed to the tens of thousands who already have. We shouldn't be looking at this as the government taking freedoms away from us, we should be looking at it as Americans working together against a common enemy.

People have been throwing around ideas like opening up the country "slowly," but that doesn't really mean anything. It's not a balancing act between the economy and human lives. We either lose some people and harm the economy, or we lose even more people and inflict greater harm to the economy. That's our choice.

If an organization of doctors, nurses, and health experts with medical degrees were leading the charge for opening the country, then I would think it's the right time, but it's not. The charge for opening the country is being led by geriatrics, tacticool militias, and sovereign citizens with Facebook pages. They're not the ones we should be listening to right now.
[comment]Yes...  But good luck having an intelligent exchange of ideas with anyone convinced we should all be locked in our homes awaiting the impending doom of civlization.
[comment]It pains me that many republicans are protesting against social distancing for reasons like “getting their hair cut”. So what if we have the freedom and rights to be outside? If you love this country stay home and keep our people safe
[comment]But if you care about people losing their jobs and consider a tiered opening of the country it means you want to open up the country tomorrow with no restrictions and you want everyone to die
[comment]Need a circle for "People that don't want any form of socialism and want very little government interference.....but willingly take government handouts and bailouts and cry foul when they get sick and the medical care in the country is horrendous".
[comment]I don't think these are equal though. I think people taking the virus and these lockdowns seriously, is of the upmost importance. This virus isn't a joke, it already killed 40,000 Americans, and over 750,000 are infected. The death rate figure might reach 200,000. That's the entire population of Boise, Idaho. That's horrifying. These lockdowns have been proven to be effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. People protesting for the states to reopen are idiots, and what they're doing is dangerous.

Once this virus calms down in a few months then we'll tackle the other two things, which are also very important.
[comment]Do you guys really think governors are enjoying the current situation? Currently these governors have the public eye on them constantly. Their states are running out of money. People on both sides are going to be upset no matter what choices they make in response to the virus, and I’m sure their re-election chances have vastly shifted. 

No one wants the economy of the states and country to  suffer, but that’s the situation we’re in. It’s pretty insane to me that people think governors are destroying their state economies on purpose for “power”. There’s no power without money or people on your side, and governors are currently losing both.
[comment]That’s me in a nutshell
[comment]100% such a tricky balance to maintain. I believe as long as the majority of us do our best to stay sane and hold our leaders to making their decisions on facts and not feelings, we'll pull through this thing alright.

[comment]That's a very rational place to be OP.
[comment]Don’t tell democrats. They want to bury the economy so they can drive up unemployment, increase government assistance (control) and use the opportunity to try to get rid of Trump.
[comment]Thank you! I'm right with you!

[comment]Good for you sir or ma'am. 

it's amazing how many people on the Reddit front page, especially in the news or worldnews subs are either gullible or just sheep that they are willing to be led by the nose by these governors, using the guise of "public safety".
[comment]So, I can't post it, as it was immediately removed... however, a man in Ohio just passed away due to the virus who had complained to the Gov about all the closings. Perhaps he should have been spending more time researching how to stay safe, just a thought. I feel bad for his family, of course and take no pleasure in anyone's death. But it is a bit ironic. I don't want to post a link as it will be removed, but Google it, it will come up.
[comment]Is this post worried about the Trump administration overreaching and threatening the rights of American citizens?
[comment]Can we have an extra circle for drinking bleach?
[comment]I feel this post hits the nail on the head. I am a republican conservative and believe we should take the virus seriously. However some states such as California and Nevada are taking this out of proportion. We cannot be confined to our homes that long and simply watch the economy fall. I believe we should all have the choice to quarantine or not. Millions of people are now unemployed and suffering from poverty. However I also believe that those that are high risk such as my grandparents (70) (78) or other people over the age of 50 or those with underlying conditions. We all need to face the virus and gain herd immunity. To conclude far too many people are suffering from poverty and unemployment to continue this mandatory lockdown any longer. But as I said I feel all high risk people such as those with underlying conditions should continue their quarantine. 

Post scripture
Very few or no healthy people under the age of 50 with no underlying conditions have died from this virus. There are viruses that are far more deadly that we’re not quarantining for such as TB. We need to face this virus and get over it, the curve has been flattened hospitals will no longer be flooded.

How did Candace figure us out? Was she in our trans friendly locker room?
[comment]I have voted by mail twice in my life. Once by absentee ballot that I mailed in due to an injury preventing me from getting to the polling center, and the other time, due to having to vote while in the middle of college (I wasn't going to drive all the way home in the middle of a school week, just to punch a ballot).
[comment]Candace is on point with the predictions
[comment]If there is a chance that fraud could happen with mail in voting then it will erode people's confidence in the system, especially in close contests. There is already a huge divide between Dems and reps, this will only serve to exacerbate it. Unnecessarily in my opinion.
[comment]My liberal friend keep saying that there are no studies to support the idea of mail in voter fraud. Can anyone find me a reputable study that shows mail in voter fraud?
[comment]Oh I’m sure this party wants to keep it out of mail so that can rig it. These bus narratives don’t help and aren’t accurate.
[comment]I mean people can go to grocery stores where you’re way more likely to get the coronavirus than going to vote. I mean hell abortion is deemed an essential business but heaven forbid you go vote, to a gym, or in some areas even set your kid on a play date, play catch with your kid, or buy seed from Home Depot. The laws are all the place. I bet if trump said to delay the 2020 election the democrats would start pushing for everything to be back to normal real fast. Just for the record, I think delaying the election is an awful idea and very unconstitutional. It would send democrats into full on panic mode

[comment]I still find it wild that Americans hold a genuine belief that mail-in/postal votes would be a hot spot for voter fraud. Genuine question here but why do so many of you believe that?

[comment]Well according to CNN's front page today, the pandemic is getting worse not better. smh
[comment]Republicans suppress voters and gerrymander districts to win elections. You people are so delusional. I don't even like democrats, but the pure hypocrisy here is crazy
[comment]I think either way, we are going to have a problem. In my state of Wisconsin, Republicans we're excited that voting in person was still going to happen because that meant that there will be low voter turnout and a lot of absentee ballots. After the election backfired on them and they lost a spot in the Supreme Court, all the Republicans claimed the election was rigged and that there were a lot of absentee ballots that never got sent it. Doesn't matter what the result is, the outcome is going to have a lot of drama.
[comment]You forgot the part where Democrats start blaming this on global warming, and then racism somehow.
[comment]Yes lets skip to the part where we follow the lead of every other first world democratic country and allow mail in ballots for those who would be endangered by exposing themselves to this virus or, in regular circumstances, are too busy working  because the government will not support an election day with a national holiday so everyone can vote.

That way it can’t be rigged through mail, and we also won’t have to hear the squeakers claim “NoT EVeRboDY GOT ThE ChaNCE TO VoTE” as if it’s the working class that doesn’t get the chance to vote, as opposed to the democrats collecting their government checks or working 8 hour jobs?

[comment]IMO the abortion debate is less about the act itself but more when we consider life to begin. Whether that’s conception, a heartbeat, birth, or some other arbitrary point in time.
[comment]Feminists? Really?
[comment]There would be a lot of false rape claims. Oh wait....
[comment]I may be over simplifying it but is the DNC procedure not the cure for both rape and incest? Is that incorrect? Not a doctor
[comment]If a woman can choose whether or not to abort the baby without the fathers consent because she doesn’t want it, then the father should be able to choose if he has to pay child support or not, without the mothers consent because he doesn’t want it. 

But they ain’t ready for that talk. It’s all “let’s push for women to have MORE rights than men in the name of ‘equality’!”
[comment]I’m totally pro-life but sooooo many more woman would have false rape accusations.
[comment]Committing another horrible act doesn't make the original horrible act go away. The child is innocent.
[comment]I would stand behind the view of a doctor, whose knowledge exceeds ours. If the first trimester doesn’t qualify as a full-born child, then I’d find that acceptable. If the second trimester qualifies as a full-born child, then it’s not acceptable.
[comment]It honestly should not be legal until we have a general consensus on when life begins. Why is abortion legal with so many unanswered questions and somethign like smoking weed isn't. We know just about all there is to know with something like that and they are still cautiously going about legalizing it, but we cant make up our minds on abortion but of course we should be having them.

I understand people believe weed should be illegal but in that case so should tobacco and alcohol. But in this case i was just using it as an example since it is still a relatively popular and current topic.
[comment]Yeah but people like Ted Cruz dont want that. Some of these pro life people dont care about that kid once it pops out.
[comment]The way I see it is, if it threats the mother's life or will be suffering from a disfiguration and have a life in pain it's ok. Personally, in rape setting up for adoption is the best.
[comment]Have never once seen anyone say “We need abortion FOR rape and incest”
[comment]I believe it should still be a liberty a woman has as a free American, especially if the pregnancy could harm/ put the mother or the offspring at risk for complication.
[comment]I still disagree. If you believe that abortion is murder, then why do the evil actions of one human being justify the murder of an innocent human being?
[comment]So you should kill the child just because of the dad?
[comment]Wait, so why is incest morally wrong? It's 2 consenting adults doing what they please with their own bodies, correct?
[comment]Does the way conception occurs decrease the value of the life?
[comment]Why would we allow them for rape and incest anyways? What specifically about rape and incest make a baby worth less than if they were born out of normal sexual relations. To me it is hypocritical that some who can call themselves prolife are fine with killing babies who were conceived through rape and incest.
[comment]I've always thought about the abortion debate with the following logic game:

Can we first agree that there is \*real\* scientific debate over when exactly life begins? As in, there's no exact agreed-upon definition. So with \*that\* said, can we agree that the point at which life begins is a hard scientific gray area?

That only leads us to one of two possible scenarios of legal and widespread abortion:

Either millions of "potential" lives are cut off for a myriad of reasons up to and including pure convenience of the "mother". 

OR  
We are allowing mass genocide in numbers that are unfathomable.

Seems like an easy exercise in figuring out which side you should err on.
[comment]I don't think a blanket law should be applied here. Should be case by case. Should it be used as birth control? No. The fetus isn't developing properly and likely won't survive birth and if it does it would be severely challenged with hardly any quality of life or risk the life of the mother or some other medical hang ups that may occur. Those are things that should be considered. They might already be I don't know. But an outright ban isn't the answer.
[comment]Rape and incest only contributes to 2% of committed abortions, such a minority of cases are seen as the very reason it exists. Smh.
[comment]You know if we increased sex ed and contraceptive funding we would actually cut down on abortions needed for accidental pregnancies but \[y'all ain't interested in that]([https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump))
[comment]This comic isn’t really accurate because there are 7 republicans controlled states that don’t allow abortion on even in the case of rape and abortion. Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio, don’t make exceptions for rape or incest cases. That’s about 15% of all States, and about 32% of republican controlled states. So I’m not really sure what this comic is trying to say.

[comment]If there is a woman that would run that shows competence for the position, people would vote for her. So far it’s been between Hillary and Warren, neither of which are behind policies that the majority want.
[comment]How about we just elect the best person for the job and stop making everything about sex and race?
[comment]I vote for the person who I think will do what’s best for the country. These identity politics are really blinding the Left from seeing reason!
[comment]Warren is a straight out thief.   It's amazing that a woman of color would support her in any way.   Warren continues to be listed as the first person of color to receive tenure at Harvard Law School.  She has stolen this title from someone who actually served it
[comment]Just seems like a weird concept “There hasn’t been a women president yet so we should support female candidates”. Shouldn’t we pick the most trusted/qualified/intelligent candidate?
[comment]I would have voted for a condoleezza rice and she is a black female and I'm a white male. To be honest I probably would have voted for her over Donald Trump at first. Knowing now what I know I'm glad she didn't run against him cause I'm not sure if we would've ever gotten another shot with trump.
[comment]I bet she’s a certified yoga instructor.
[comment]How about I want to vote for the most qualified person regardless of their phallic status?
[comment]Present me with a woman running for President that has a platform I agree with, who believes in the things I believe in and I will vote for her
[comment]over half of democratic voters are women.
[comment]Put up a woman worth voting for.
[comment]I gave money to Carly Fiorina's campaign because I thought she was smart and I liked her philosophy, so I do not need a lecture.  Rather than scold men for not voting for your candidate, maybe you should have some humility and ask yourself what you did wrong.
[comment]Of course the left will blame men. Because some women are apparently not yet advanced enough to admit our own screw ups and say "I couldn't get it done." We're only advanced enough to blame men. Will it ever occur to pathological lying sociopath Warren Out that her constant lies did her in.
[comment]I would vote for a black 40 year old woman who is a Republican then a 75 year old white guy democrat.
[comment]We elect someone based on the content of their character not the composition of their chromosomes.
[comment]But I thought democrats were all inclusive and equality supporting? How dare they not support a woman!
[comment]Refused to vote for a pathological liar?  Must be sexism.
[comment]I'll gladly vote for a SMART women for president. There are plenty of business women out there that I think could do a good job. Warren just is dumb and not for the American people.
[comment]I’m not gonna vote for someone whos an idiot and has terrible ideas just cause they’re a woman. So no, you shouldn’t necessarily want more women presidents. We should want the best president. And if that happens to be a women then that’s fine. They have everything backwards.
[comment]I agree.  Men are to blame.  

I can’t be her amazingly low turnout.  Or her history of being the worst kind of race pimp.  Or the blatant dirty tricks she used openly on people like on Sanders.  Or her profound fakeness.  Her willingness to lie about literally anything.

It was men.

*-No, not like that.*
[comment]She's about 50% right.
[comment]A woman won the popular vote in 2016 tf you on about
[comment]It's easier to blame a group for an alleged wrongdoing rather than focus on an ineffective clown
[comment]„Why should a woman settle for a number 2 job? " Because she wasn't good enough for number 1? Why would we choose the most important person in the world for four years based on gender? That's so stupid
[comment]Good lord ok ima day it( coming from a woman here) I don’t want a woman president if she isn’t good. Not only is that bad for our country, but it makes the idea of a woman president look bad for the future and therefore people won’t be likely to vote for one again.
[comment]There will never be a time on this earth that I would ever listen to even one thing this man-hating, lecturing, old battle axe would have to say.  I don't care if you think thats misogynist or whatever.  She is just a nasty elitist history teacher no nothing spouting her hateful rhetoric only trying like hell to control everything you do and say.  Screw her.  Bye Felicia.
[comment]Well, not conservative men...
[comment]But men are to blame! Blame Joe and Bernie for getting more votes.
[comment]Warren didn't win because progressives arent a big voting group, we all know the saying go woke get broke.
[comment]Lying Pocahonkie is to blame.
[comment]Serious question in what way was she different then bernie? I mean besides being a woman and *1/5000 native american*

[comment]Serious question: why is this a Republican v Democrat issue? 
This whole lock down vs not thing seems more like an Authoritarian v Libertarian thing to me.
[comment]This is what we miss in California and what we need more of. But when this shows up in the r/politics sub, this man will be crucified for aiding and abetting death because he won't arrest people for being outdoors. There are zero constitutional laws that allow life and liberty to be taken from us due to a virus. How long is this going to go on due to Democrat despair over their next POTUS loss? Instead of robbing us of our freedom and very lives, maybe the left should try to get their party together and stop the hysterics.
[comment]Reposting my comment from the /r/conservative post of this same video:

&gt; Just a reminder that not all California is "California." We might have more registered democrats than any other state (about 8.5M , or 44% of our registered voters). But we still have a shit-ton of republicans too. Even though its only 25% of our registered voters that are republicans, that's more than 4.5M. 

&gt; Texas may be the only state with more republican voters but the data I pulled from says Texas doesn't register by party so I don't know what they actually have.

&gt; Just saying not to write all of us off. I'd say at least half of our counties are solidly republican. A lot of them may have smaller populations but they're there.

&gt; We also have more independents than any other state, something like 4.8M (more than republicans). If even 25% of these voted (R), thats still 1.2M, more than some states total registered voters.

<|startoftext|>[title]It’s Time To Stop Pretending Twitter Is A Neutral Platform
[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/28/its-time-to-stop-pretending-twitter-is-neutral/[comment]I didnt know anyone was! Neutral twitter is like saying reddit is... Laughable.
[comment]I mean.. it is a publicly traded company, not a government run organization. To ever think it was neutral whichever way they want to lean is a little crazy.
[comment]Use another platform. It’s a free country.
[comment]Twitter is a voluntary platform, if you don’t want to adhere to their TOS then you are free to go elsewhere. Trying to make social media be in line with government agenda is an unnecessary line to cross.
[comment]It's a public company, they can do what they like with their company, if you don't like it build your own or don't use it. Just like a baker can refuse to serve a gay couple Twitter can do the same
[comment]I don’t think it’s a question of neutrality either.

Twitter is calling people out on their obvious bullshit now and let’s face it, if you want to get somebody angry call them out on their bullshit without any evidence. In this case at least it’s passing some sort of marginal fact check it’s not just willy-nilly opinion masquerading as news. Some things are only debatable to a small group.

Also this executive is constantly going back to make corrections to what he said. Folks still want reliable info.
[comment]It’s a private company. But let’s not let that stop us from supporting this idiotic EO.

Why is everyone surprised that the most high-profile user got flagged but tons of small users who say stupid things aren’t being censored? Gee, I don’t know, maybe put a half second of thought into it.
[comment]The commenters in this thread who dislike the Executive Order need to read up about Platforms vs Publishers and read how the Order did not do anything, it just clarified that the companies were liable for editorializing content under an already existing law.  
  
It doesnt matter if you are a private company. Newpapers who are private companies dont get to publish anything they want either.
[comment]In my opinion It is waaaaay more neutral than reddit but less than facebook.
[comment]Everyone already knew Twitter is a dumpster fire, even my friends said Twitter is nasty and to delete it. Lol
[comment]I'm conflicted about this. Yes, Twitter and Facebook are private companies that should not be responsible for what messages are expressed on their platforms, but would anyone think it's acceptable for your ISP or telephone provider to block an email or phone call if their algorithm detected that you were saying something that went against their political ideologies? Twitter and Facebook have become primary methods of human contact, much like email and telephone. Allowing such a company the authority to decide what beliefs are ok to express or not goes against the basic principle of free speech.
[comment]The fact theyve allowed him to stay on the platform spewing hate and false information for all these years shows they really arent leaning left like all yall suddenly seem to think.
They censored a tweet from the POTUS talking about shooting americans. They left his “only good democrat is a dead democrat” tweet alone though. He lost the popular vote so what he thinks over half of the voting population should be killed? What a joke of a country lmao
[comment]I never did pretend is was a neutral platform...

Who ever did? Who still is?

And neither is Reddit. It's as far left as you can get.
[comment]It's time to stop pretending any platform is neutral.
[comment]Yea let’s focus on the pandemic and record unemployment.
[comment]social media is a failed experiment in humanity
[comment]Time to stop pretending  reddit and all of social media are neutral.  I'm starting to think all of social media is a cancer on the planet for healthy societies
[comment]Everyone knows Twitter blows.
[comment]Nothing is a neutral platform anymore. I only see one side of the news on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, IG, etc.
[comment]...ALL social media platforms ! Not just Twitter
[comment]Losing CDA 230 immunity and federal advertising revenue will hurt. Hope the Board is ready for shareholder lawsuits.
[comment]I'm very hesitant to tread down this path. Anybody notice the stickied comment on every post in this sub?

&gt; /r/Republican is a partisan subreddit

The government pulling platform status is dangerous for everybody. We can be mad that lots of people use twitter and point out twitter is often wrong but once you pull out the dinner table cloth there's no easy way of putting it back
[comment]When I joined the various social platforms I had the expectation of neutrality.
[comment]I made a comment on some lefty site to that effect and got pummeled with down votes. 
Convinced Reddit is controlled by communist China/looney left.

...and to answer the naysayer’s, Twitter has certain protection as a medium or platform and individual’s post on that platform. They get protection because they make no judgement on posts, only provide the means to express the idea. 
When you inject yourself as an arbiter of content, your a publisher in the digital age.
[comment]This is so good. What you guys have to do to make things like this sound something near normal. House is under fire but hey, everything´s fine and under control. Twitter was fine until two days ago. But now they are the enemy. You don´t like a bit but they will resist your lunatic
[comment]When did we start?
[comment]At least i can see others ferrets here.
Twatter is the biggest joke. I was booted for a week for saying all pedos should hang. 

You would think they wouldn't be against that.
[comment]So Twitter is a little biased so let’s start a bill to try to take it down?
[comment]Why have republicans suddenly decided they hate the concept of private property? Feckless communists. Y'all are the same as democrats now. Ridiculous.
[comment]Well I mean it is a private company so they can swing whichever way they want. Zuck criticised what they did but his company is also private so they’re both entitled to doing things in different ways
[comment]Twitter is trash
[comment]Never once did I think it was neutral. It’s a cesspool for SJWs.
[comment]It sucks man. Jack forces me against my will and MAKES me use twitter instead of the other dozen social media sites. FUCK HIM<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/if-democrats-nominate-bernie-sanders-they-hand-the-election-to-trump[comment]Don't know about that. I'd vote for Bernie over Trump.
[comment]Disagree.

I think Bernie, an independent in Congress, is the shakeup America needs. He's got an "American First" attitude without the War on Drugs and leads in donations from people, not Corporations.

The DNC hates him so he's doing something right lol
[comment]Bernie would absolutely tank the economy so Wall Street would get behind Trump. Trump will easily beat him. 




Bernie is a self admitted socialist, and that should be terrifying for Americans to hear. This man touted Venezuela as a great model before the inevitable happened there. Hell, he honeymooned in the USSR. Bernie is socialist scum deceiving easily tricked naive college students.
[comment]I remember during the West Virginia primaries in 2016 news stations were asking people who they supported. People were supporting Bernie. When asked who they planned on voting for if Bernie didn’t get the nomination they answered with Trump.
[comment]If Bernie is nominated trump is in big trouble imo. Anyone else and he easily wins
[comment]Bernie will destroy Trump if Trump doesn't destroy himself first.
[comment]Bernie is the only one who recognizes the dangers of climate change. Elect anyone else and New York will probably go underwater within 20 years. Gives a whole new meaning to Wall Street is sinking
[comment]Tbf if they nominate Biden, they do the same
[comment]It's funny because over to the other side, the people voting Democrat say Bernie is the only who can beat Trump.
[comment]If they nominate anyone other than Joe Biden, they had it to Trump
[comment]People with big money dont want Bernard to tank the economy, so big money would silently push President Trump (even if they dont want him overall) because they vote with their brains and wallets.

Imagine telling a bunch of very rich and powerful people who either directly or by proxy employee millions that they will make a lot less money forever until the Socialism BS is out in total. "hey, give up your money" is a great selling point? LOL
[comment]I honestly believe the only person who can beat Trump is Michelle and even that will be a close one. Even then..VOTE
[comment]Holy Bernie brigade!
[comment]I don’t know, the Democrat Elites can’t win the working man, and Bernie has proven he can in places like West Virginia. Maybe he can’t beat Trump, but at the same time maybe he’d come closer than another Dem Elitist.
[comment]It’s important to point out that every democrat said Trump had no chance of beating Hillary, and here we are.
[comment]I think Biden is the only serious candidate. The rest of the communists are just to far to the left.
[comment]Never take that for granted though. No one thought Trump could ever beat Hillary.
[comment]If they nominate Bernie, Biden or Warren, they hand the election to Trump. All three candidates are unelectable.
[comment]Bernie is 5 bridges too far
[comment]If you happen to see my F150 and it has a Trump sticker and a Bernie Sanders sticker, now you know why.
[comment]I disagree. I think Sanders will be trouble for Trump bec he speaks the same language of appeasing workers and bringing back jobs. Also, single payer healthcare is popular with both sides of the aisle.
[comment]If any Democrat faces Trump it's an easy Trump landslide. Biden is corrupt and senile. Talking about kids rubbing his hairy legs at the pool. Warren is full of crap, lying about everything, and pandering to everybody. Buttigieg is a young kid that can't run South Bend let alone the country.
[comment]There’s only one logical thing to do then! Republican Party should back Bernie to ensure Trump’s success!
[comment]Trump’s winning regardless of Democrat at this point.
[comment]I respectfully disagree with the title.  It should be replaced with "If Democrats nominate anyone , they hand the election to Trump".
[comment]I believe the election is a bit too far to make such a claim.
[comment]I can't see Bernie getting the nod. I have a feeling it will either be Biden or Warren. Trump would mop the floor with Bernie. Not to mention Obama has said Bernie is not a Democrat and that he would discourage voters from voting his way if it came to it. It also doesn't look good that he refuses to endorse his own former VP. Either way, Im voting Trump in 2020.
[comment]It’s going to be Bloomberg vs Trump
[comment]I’m afraid Sanders is the most formidable. Vermont is a fairly conservative state and he has won there for decades.
[comment]If they nominate Biden, Trump wins easily. Sanders though I think might have a fighting chance.
[comment]That would also make AOC the leader of the Democratic party. l doubt Pelosi and Schumer will let it happen.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Unpopular opinion "whistleblowers" are a vital part of any organization for immoral and illegal acts whether it helps your party or not it is important to have them root out issues even if it the allegations weren't correct in the end.
[comment]Regardless of  what one's opinion on Trump behaviour or the Democrats behaviour,  protecting a whistleblower identity is fundamental and essential for the very mechanism of Whistleblowers to exist. And the very existence of the whistleblower mechanism  is an important contribution to democracy.  If we go down on whistleblower like this and rip them in the public place, then the message we are sending to other potential future whistleblower is that they better shut up and not say anything otherwise they are risking their lives.  This is what happens in Dictatorships.

[comment]I'm hoping that turns out to be who it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I read the transcript, looked to me like that ass-hole ambassador to Ukraine was trying to entrap people into saying there was a quid-pro-quo. According to the transcript, he had to be told several times that wasn't the case, though he seemed to be pushing to do that. He was on the call in question, so could easily be the problem.
[comment]They sure look like a happy bunch there.  So much smiling!
[comment]This is completely inaccurate- "This picture was not taken on Thursday, but rather a day earlier as Obama spoke in a live televised address after Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton conceded to Trump." Per [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4566547/white-house-obama-staffers-donald-trump/%3famp=true).

<|startoftext|>[title]I feel so bad for Donald Trump. He is an amazing leader and never gets the respect he deserves. It’s so sad. I’m so proud with how calm and contained he has been throughout his whole presidency and especially now during this global crisis. Thank you for being our leader!

[comment]I don't feel that bad. He loves the heat. He doesnt love the crisis itself, but he thrives on media backlash.
[comment]He's an idiot and a lunatic
[comment]He’s got a ton of supporters by his side too, he understands the fake news haters are not reality. I think it actually gives him energy lol
[comment]Apparently, staying calm and telling people things will get better is wrong.

[comment]I'm surprised the Bernie Babies are still crying about him even though they're gonna be receiving a check for not working like they wanted.
[comment]Probably going to get downvoted for this but here goes.

I'm not a huge fan of trump and especially his mouth, but I would be lying if I said he wasn't an accomplished president. His foreign policy has been a mixed bag and domestically has been quite good. He definitely doesn't get the recognition he deserves and DEFINITELY doesn't deserve the amount of hate he gets from the left and the msm. Anytime he does a good thing the left just can't let him have it and come together to celebrate, instead they have to become pro terrorist and root for the collapse of the economy because orange man bad
[comment]Did he just say he would comply with investigation into how he spend 500 billion despite signing the law?
[comment]Perfect summary of my sentiments.
[comment]Agreed!
[comment]The way you talk about Trump is kind of creepy in a cultish way
[comment]I honestly believe hate and drama fuel his ego. 
And I do like Trump as a leader - he's decisive, has the balls to say what he thinks, and really puts America first. 
But I'm not going to deny there's a lot of narcissism on his part. But hey, if we all get a bigger piece of the pie, it's good by me. 
Most people that hate Trump hate him because of his abrasive personality, with little knowledge of what he's actually done for the economy. 
And even when he does something good, they still hate on him because these people are really deranged. You really can't argue with these people.
[comment]Yep
[comment]I do think he’s a great leader, but coming down to real morals and values, he isn’t that great.

I’m still supporting him more than Bernie thi
[comment]I’ve been coming to this sub for months. Have never commented. Trying to figure out how anyone can support this criminal. 

After months there’s only one thing I need to ask. Then I will unjoin.

What the hell are you people smoking or drinking. I want some. Haven’t hallucinated since the 70’s.
[comment]This post title is so fucking creepy to me. The cult of personality that surrounds Trump is fucking weird. 

Objectively he hasn't been calm and contained this presidency. He lashes out like...a lot.
[comment]I’m not sure why anyone would feel bad for Donald Trump.  The guy’s a billionaire, in arguably the most powerful position on the planet.  A position he fought very hard to get, and a position he wants to occupy again in 2020.  People don’t give him “respect”?  Okay, welcome to politics.

You know who I feel bad for?  My boss’s friend, who will probably lose her small business running a salon due to the pandemic.  I feel bad for the doctors and nurses who died from Coronavirus because they didn’t have the proper PPE.

You know who I don’t feel sorry for? Billionaire politicians who will be fine no matter what happens.  Feeling bad for people like that is like feeling sorry for Hollywood starlets because someone was mean to them on Twitter.  It comes with the territory.
[comment]Oh man, Trump is the absolute worst and anyone that cant see that is coo-coo-ka-ka insano.
[comment]Not just “being our leader”, but “Our Great Leader”.

I say that non-ironically.
[comment]I think he's a great leader. I don't like him as a person though. Seems like a jerk. But solid leader.
[comment]Democrats have gone completely crazy over Trump. Recently in r/politics, some dude said that even if it was Trump vs OJ Simpson, he’d vote against Trump. I said that Trump is not worse than OJ Simpson, and I got downvoted for it! These crazy Democrats gaslit by the media so much that they think that Donald Trump is literally worse than a murderer. Their TDS is so bad that they’d probably vote for Ted Bundy over Trump
[comment]Honestly I don’t know how that man can just wake up everyday and just be able to deal with all that hate he gets from the Media and the Do Nothing Democrats. Just imagine waking up every morning and thinking to yourself “There are MILLIONS of people who would love to have a public hanging of me or worse.” I don’t think some people realize how emotionally tough of a job being president is. Rather you like him or not, you have to admit he has balls of titanium.
[comment]Hes an accused rapist, racist, and sexist. How can you be om with this?
[comment]I voted for him in 2016 hoping he would be at least half as successful as he'd turned out to be. He has surpassed all my expectations. He gets criticized for many things, including his brashness and unpresidential-ness. But many of the critics don’t take into account the fact that all those qualities make him who he is and add to his success. 

I didn’t vote for him to be my pastor, or a teacher, or a husband or a counselor. I voted for him to be a president. He’s the top mo-fo and he’s got the exact right personality to be the top mo-fo at this point in the history of our country. 

Do you think anyone aside from him would have been able to stand up to the left commie machine the way he had? Do you know of anyone who was running against him in the primaries on the right who could have taken the amount of abuse he’s been able to take? And through all of this he’s been kicking ass and taking names.

And nobody has been better at forcing the left to take off their masks and show themselves for the radical commies and swamp monsters they really are. Many democrat voters are waking up and seeing their own party for the swamp it’s become. And nobody but Trump could have pulled it off the way he had.
[comment]Amazing, seriously? Your infection rate is worse than ours.
[comment]This is how Trump "deals" with the virus

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 7: “We’ll hold tremendous rallies...I’m not concerned at all.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on coronavirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 10: "Over a million tests have been distributed," Pence said, and "before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed." (Obviously not a trump quote, but it's to illustrate how ridiculous they've been)

March 10: "Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!"

March 11: "I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!"

March 12: "108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem, some of which we are helping!"

March 13: "To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!"

March 13: "Today I am declaring a national emergency. Two very big words."

March 13. "No, I don't take responsibility at all. Because we were given a set of circumstances, given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we are talking about."

March 13. "We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act ... I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I'll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about."

March 15: “This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something we have tremendous control over.”

March 16: “We’re going to win. And I think we’re going to win faster than people think — I hope. On a scale from 1-10, I rate my response as a 10.”

March 17: “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. People are dying who never died before.”

March 19: “Governors are suppose to do a lot of this work. We’re not a shipping clerk.”

March 24: : "I do… we are doing very well with almost all the governors… \[but\] it’s a two-way street, they have to treat us well also."

March 24: "The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States."

March 24: Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. Been going for a while, but we’ll win. We’ll win.

March 25: “You’re going to have suicides by the thousands” “People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death. Probably and — I mean, definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus.”

March 26: "I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?"

March 27: As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.

March 27: General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!! u/GeneralMotors u/Ford

March 27: Mike Pence. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I’m a different type of person — I say, 'Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You are wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.' It doesn’t make any difference what happens.

March 27: You call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus. You know, you can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is, but the children do very well.
[comment]Delt a very bad hand from Obama and now Covid19.
[comment]Personally I feel that's he's been less than calm. He often lashes out, he just uses Twitter instead of other avenues that we are used to. And as president everything you do is looked at under a microscope and criticized. As it should be. 

And genuinely curious, what do you get out of that last line of thanking Trump. When people do that I feel like it's the same people that clap at the end of movies
[comment]🤣
[comment]Trump is the worst Republican president we have had since Nixon. He isn’t a leader - he’s a bully. He tries to “will” things to be reality and is self centered and too concerned about his image.

I agree he has been unfairly bashed by the media and the demo-rats witch hunts have been wrong.

He isn’t anywhere near the leader Reagan or the Bushes were.
[comment]He's an "amazing leader" yet he spent the first two months of this crisis calling coronavirus a "democratic hoax" and assuring us everything was perfectly okay and that we should just live our normal lives. Now that shit has completely gone downhill, he's trying to gaslight us and claim that he took it seriously the entire time, and is now calling it the "Chinese virus" in an attempt to make us focus on hating China instead of him. His incompetency has killed thousands of Americans during this pandemic, and it will kill thousands more. He will go down as the worst president in U.S. history.
[comment]I don’t know. This is his Churchill moment and he is blowing it. He should have more address the nation speeches where he gives status updates directly to the nation.
[comment]There seems to be an epidemic of assholes that are completely misguided by the media and our liberal higher ed system. Seems like most people are happy to accept what they hear without doing a little research on their own to find the truth. Sure Trump may not be the greatest guy you’d want to hang out with at the backyard BBQ, but he’s done a hell of a job with the economy and standing up to foreign bullies in Europe and beyond. People don’t like his style but it’s working ....
[comment]He's a monster.
[comment]He isn't perfect, no human is. But I think he is doing the best he can. After all, we have never faced something like this before.
[comment]The President's main issue is his mouth. It seems the older he's gotten, the less of a filter he has. That becomes an issue because it takes the focus off of what he's accomplished and onto what he says.
[comment]I disagree. I don't think he's been doing a great job handling. There was a moment of two weeks where he was taking it seriously but words matter. There is countless evidence that he originally claimed to not believe in the severity and has now as recently as yesterday blamed hospitals for hoarding. 

The amount of mixed information isn't good for maintaining unity with the public and my concern is that he holding his rallies via the the press briefings. Some said that "actions speak louder than words". Sure, but words still matter, a lot, and he hasn't been consistent throughout any of this. 

Sure the economy is tanking but there are thousands to millions more people or tanking even harder. It feels like he never seems to get that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]FACT CHECK: No, Trump Did Not Tell People To ‘Inject Themselves With Disinfectant’ Or ‘Drink Bleach’
[selftext]https://www.dailywire.com/news/fact-check-no-trump-did-not-tell-people-to-inject-themselves-with-disinfectant-or-drink-bleach?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=benshapiro[comment]I love this sort of story when it goes viral like this.  Today Trump even doubled down on it, ensuring the media will lose their minds over what's essentially a non-story.  

Is this a policy issue?  Nope.  Do Republicans and Conservatives care about this sort of trivia?  Nope.  

But the liberal media will run wild with this, distracting all the Democrats from building a policy based platform that will bring voters out.  Instead all they have is an empty bag that says 'vote against trump' and win everything in this bag.
[comment]Once again President Trump demonstrates how easy it is to distract a stupid chicken with a bug.  (Rural experience req'd. for full understanding)
[comment]UV light is used every day at our hospital to sanitize our N-95 masks. Trump is always right.
[comment]Liberalism is a sickness
[comment]I just got banned on r/facepalm for stating that same fact.  I’m so glad to be a subscriber here!!
[comment]Trump trolls the press again.
[comment]He clarified he was being sarcastic. Most people don’t get his sense of humor. He likes to work the fake news into a frenzy by suggesting idiotic proposals, like injecting a human with disinfectant, that no rational person would believe or actually do.
[comment]Does this really need to be said?
[comment]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122858/
[comment]But But But CNN deciphered Trump speak for me and they said we have to drink bleach because it cure the cancer.
[comment]CNN stated that trump the whole world in order to prevent Rona, to take bleach capsules analy. Heard it on CNN so it must be true.
[comment]Even if he did and they believed him. Let them go. It’s for the best.
[comment]Crazy how many people are repeating that!

And I'll say "please provide the quote where he says that".

And they say, "well, he didn't say THAT, but..."

Here's what he said:

&gt;"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me."

He doesn't suggest injecting bleach.

He ends with "let's talk to doctors".

Ugh.
[comment]OMG OK I WAS GONNA POST THIS HERE! But thank you!. My facebook post has been bombarded with fake news from people who more than likely heard it through word of mouth. So I had to watch the actual speech and never did he ever suggest that people inject themselves with lysol but that “they” the medical professional were looking into a type of disinfectant that could be injected to clear the virus. If people would do their own research and actually watch the announcement they would see that. Unless they have TDS! DJT2020!
[comment]I understand that he was referring to how the UV light is used as the disinfectant.

The reason for the craziness around his statement is how he stated them. He talked about the UV light and his fascination with it. Then paused as if he was going to start his briefing. 

Then he started in about the disinfectant. If he didn't pause or made a connection between the two it is easily understandable that his wording makes it seem like he was suggesting disinfectant products versus the disinfectant delivered by the UV light.
[comment]The lefts blind hatred for Trump is showing. Although it won't matter because He'll be president until 2024 so ( ︶︿︶)_╭∩╮them.
[comment]CNN has not told the truth in many years...they have their own warped opinions and assume everything.....but no truth
[comment]I’ve posted on a number of subreddits and as you can guess got severely downvoted but I don’t care. 

The only thing he said wrong is “inject”. The correct word would be “ingest” , but slips happen. 

Ironically my medical partner sent me a link today unrelated to Trump asking if we should follow a new guideline. He sent a link related to betadine use in the nose, as large scale nasal/throat irrigation, and gargles.  It’s a freaking disinfectant we place on the skin to sterilize it befor surgery.  There’s a number of scientific articles on it, but here’s actually a NY times articles on using it for gargles and it’s effect on reducing viral load: [betadine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/well/live/gargle-gargling-coronavirus-infections-bacteria-virus.html) 

He never F’ing said to drink bleach or Lysol.  The liberal reddit mental gymnastics is mind boggling at times.
[comment]The people that had been telling others to drink bleach and wants to themselves is offended because a guy allegedly said to drink bleach when in reality he didn’t

🤔
[comment]Now time to lather myself in leftist tears
[comment]You know, I’ve never much liked trump, and I think he says a lot of stupid things and isn’t always articulate. But come on. He’s so obviously not telling people to drink bleach. He’s talking about different, emerging science that might have promising results. He just doesn’t bring it up in the best way.
[comment]It's a good thing he clarified because Democrats don't understand 4D chess. If he didn't clarify you'd have all the Democrats trying to drink hand sanitizer.
[comment]This post deserves a silver. You’re welcome
[comment]Trump is the master troll. I’m glad he could hit them one more time through this lie fest of theirs.
[comment]But he did say this, right? 

&gt; And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning?<|endoftext|>

[comment]It’s important to attribute these flaws to both parties. Despite one’s political leaning, one is just as likely to make mistakes. It’s important to remember that all sides are human. Does Obama have his flaws? Completely, he hid imperialism under the banner of liberal policy. Is Trump flawed? Yes, wealth inequality has risen to a tremendous degree.
[comment]At this point it’s just become a blame game. Both sides have faults. Both sides have crooks. Both sides are far from perfect. Politics have changed and nowadays it’s more important to put blame and call out opponents rather than focus on making America a better place to live. If Democrats and Republicans put their heads together in a civilized manner with no cameras and no reality TV bullshit we would progress much further as a society.
[comment]Yeah, I know, right? Trump has NEVER done anything wrong. Right? 

Look, I'm a republican, but I still have my opinions.  Trump's an idiot.
[comment]Blagojevich was impeached and imprisoned by a Democrat-led legislature in Illinois. Just wanted to put that out there.

I also don't see why we shouldn't hold Trump accountable for things we criticize the Democrats on. Running up the deficit, treating women inappropriately, warmongering, restricting gun ownership, profiting from his office, appointing family and friends in political offices as favors, golfing instead of working, the list goes on. If we complained about Obama and Biden doing it wr have to complain about Trump doing it.

Judge not, lest ye be judged.
[comment]I am extremely disappointed with how “creepy and sexist” Joe Biden is. He’s as creepy and sexist as the most well behaved grandfather at thanksgiving dinner.
[comment]Weird sex? Oral sex is not weird.
[comment]Both sides, eh?
[comment]Honestly during the last election, I sat on my absentee ballot for like a week because I didn’t want to vote for Trump but I didn’t want Hillary to win. Since then, I’ve actually grown to like Trump. Mostly because the Left absolutely hates him and I think it’s comical the way they’ve used every avenue to try and get rid of him, but nothing works. Anyway, in keeping with the theme of the original post, the Dems have no leg to stand on with their holier than thou bullshit. I feel like the blame game, disinformation campaigns, and political entrenchment of both sides are only going to get worse.
[comment]Bluntly, it's a 4th Amendment issue; if the democrats are not prosecuted for similar or worse crimes, then it is not right to go after trump.

Equal application of the law; it must apply to everyone equally. The fact that democrats are exempt from it remains a serious problem.
[comment]I will post this to /politics 

Come at me bro.
[comment]This comment on r/ShitPoliticsSays sums up pretty well whatever the left is doing, courtesy of u/Euphemism:


&gt;I've noticed that a lot on the left. You can always count on the following happen after the first action.

1st - Someone, likely a conservative, gets elected.

2nd - The left freaks out. They get organized. The unions get involved. They start to protest, create a scene, impede peoples movement, just generally cause chaos.

3rd - They dig up dirt on the person, their family, and associates for anything even tangentially "problematic". If they can't find anything, then that absence of bad stuff just means they are just hiding it, and then will harass said person, family or associates to get them to lash out at the harassment and use that lashing out as the "problematic" item.

4th - Then their talking heads will give interviews on all the TV, radio and newspapers(That will freely give them air time, and not question or mention any of the above items) to explain how we can not have someone that causes such division and violence and chaos in our community...

It always seems to follow the same pattern, regardless of the city, state or country.

[comment]r/T_D is leaking; President Trump mocked a disabled reporter and then defended the use of the hand gesture and the “hurrr I don’t recall” by saying he wasn’t mocking his physical disability he was just calling the guy a mental retard which is worse than mocking a physical disability. He’s a disgrace as President and the fact that democrats won’t hold their own accountable doesn’t change that.
[comment]Doesn't change that Trump IS inappropriate, just shows the hypocrisy of what each party is willing to overlook when it comes to their own. A similar list could be made of Republicans, hell, Trump and Roy Moore could be a full list alone.
[comment]Just because other politicians committed crimes it doesn't make Trump less currupt. May they all get punishments proportional to their own crimes. Whataboutism is deflection.

- cheated on his wife of 20+ years with his brother's widow

- cheated on his brother's widow with some rando half his age and fathered an illegitimate child, which he denied until recently proven

- cheated on his dead brother's widow with a woman much younger....at least he married her.

Such a great man!
[comment]Socialism is more than just health care. I take it you’re from the US? I feel like a lot of Americans have been brought up to believe it’s a dirty word like communism. Ironically, the US already enjoys a ton of socialist programs and benefits.

But on health care - I grew up in Australia, a socialist democracy with a massive economy for its population. Healthcare there is far superior to living in the US as I do now. It’s incomparable. Wait times are longer in America. And you’re enslaved to your work if you get sick. It’s archaic. 

I’m not arguing with you about the capitalist economy being the way to go, although it’s far from perfect.

[comment]This logical fallacy is called the "tu quoque" argument, wherein rather than address the claim or the criticisms themselves, the responder addresses criticism with criticism.
A smarter response would be to address and logically justify the claims of the criticisms.

[comment]The most glaring aspect of your message is the dubiousness of redirecting attention from one wrong to another.

Then, if we assume the intention is to defend Trump per se and not his entire administration, it's telling that this message makes no attempt to put him on equal footing with Obama. Instead, the message piles on Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, John Edwards, Rod Blagojevich, and Weiner.

As a side point, it's certainly curious that Trump is mulling a pardon for Blagojevich.

Returning to my initial point, this message implies that you, OP, are OK with Trump violating the Emoluments clauses of the Constitution, violating the Flores agreement, reneging on JCPOA, denying the death toll of Hurrican Maria, endangering national security re security clearance scandal, endangering national security re climate change denial, and backing Putin over the IC re cyberwar.

As for the accusation that Obama gave money to terrorists, the reality is that he unfroze Iranian assets as part of the JCPOA.

And before any simpletons reply, I don't care about the Clintons. If Bill did terrible things with Epstein, he should rot in jail. I don't care. 

Furthermore, for anyone reading this who only gets their news from one or two sources, I highly encourage you to diversify your diet. Even if you're allergic to reading, MSNBC, CNN, and FOX aren't your only choices. There's PBS , CBS News, Al Jazeera, Democracy Now, your local affiliates,.

What I do care about is that we have a president that works for America; we don't have that now.
[comment]Democrats accuse republicans of what they actually did. Sad thing is they democrats were the ones to cheat in the 2016 election and still lost
[comment]Hey genius, you had to take 40 years of Dem history to come up with all the flaws that are present in Trump

Drinking 3 peg of whiskey every day won't kill you. Drinking 120 pegs in one day will
[comment]Truly curious as to how bad behavior on one side equates to bad behavior on the other.  I know this is a nation with only 2 prominent parties, but why should any of us be ok with allowing any immoral people to be given a pass because"the other side" has failures as well.  Surely we should be able to see that all of the miscreants should be held to task.  Deflecting blame because someone else sucks is a child's strategy.  Any adult worth their weight should see it for what it's worth, and assign blame/punishment accordingly.  If this passing the buck becomes the new normal, then we are doomed to Idiocracy.
[comment]My two cents here would be that it took a list of 8 individuals to draw comparison to a single individual.  I believe that there's enough information for a reasonable individual to find Trump guilty of several indecent (if not entirely illegal) acts. I would not expect or stand for anyone from the other side of the aisle to be treated differently.
[comment]That doesn't exactly make Trump not inappropriate. I lean right and I get that he's a moron...
[comment]8 people, we know Trump by himself has exceeded Biden And matched Edwards. He is a horrible human being. the fact we seem to forgive all sins committed by him is disgusting.   


in addition, Obama and Clinton’s entries require either accepting things that we know are proven false, or stretching facts pretty far.  This one image is a great example of where we have went wrong.
[comment]Quid pro quo is what joe Biden actually did with Ukraine. It was the Clinton foundation who collided in the 2016 election. It’s the democrats who aren’t following the constitution by following a proper impeachment procedures. They just don’t like trump so want him gone. Get over it you lost
[comment]It’s funny that you think any democrats legitimately support Biden.
[comment]So your defense to Trump being inappropriate is other people being inappropriate too? Two wrongs don't make a right in my book.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Did you know that
More people have died from living on earth than from the Corona virus.
[comment]Yes, the dumb media downplayed it in Jan and Feb. Donald Trump downplayed it in March. 

On March 9, he tweeted "So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!"

[comment]If you want to know who is in the pocket of the Chinese Communist Party just listen to who is using Chinese Communist Party talking points verbatim to attack the President of the United States and the American citizens.

When Stalin was purging and starving his citizens the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Hitler was coming to power, the Western media denied it and covered it up. When the Holodomor was happening the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Mao was murdering his own people starving them to death and executing them the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were executing people, shooting 9-year-old girls in the head and starving people to death the Western media denied it and covered it up.  When the communist where attacking Korea the Westen media denied it and covered it up. When the North Vietnamese began attacking the South the Western media denied it and covered it up.  When Pol Pot emptied the cities and slaughtered the population in Cambodia creating the killing fields the Western media denied it and covered it up. When White farmers were being slaughtered in Zimbabwe the Western media denied it and covered it up. When the South African farmers are being slaughtered the Western media deny it and cover it up and persuade nations to deny White South African refugee status. 

Do you see the pattern here?

And today when looking at History looking back at events the Western media rewrites the truth and manufacturing fiction to deny reality and cover up the truth. 

The communist movement has been very busy very active (Wikipedia, Socialist media publisher, blue checkmark twits) rewriting history and in the library system having books removed and destroyed. In the publishing and distribution industry having books removed from stores and band from online sales going as far as having Visa, Square, and Master card deny service and PayPal shut down accounts.

Wall Street is the modern-day slave boat owners of old.  They have modernized slavery using the Chinese Communist Party as the plantation owner to provide the slave labour for their profits.  Instead of moving the slaves to the factories they simply moved all the factories out of Western Democracies to Communist China, to the slaves.

socalist media publisher run by communists staffed by cultists funded by the oil kingdoms all for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party and Soros Open Society Foundation's Open Border project.
[comment]Yes, this is a good point, but to be fair, the president _should_ have access to privileged information that the media does not.
[comment]It would be nice to actually see the dates of these articles.  I think we were all downplaying the virus up until about a month ago, me included obviously.  The problem with Trump is that his understanding of how serious this virus could be was very delayed.  And when he finally decided to accept the reality of the situation, it was a little too late.

[comment]Do you have to fail an IQ test to be a Republican?
[comment]Media reports what other people say and do. If you disagree with what other people say and do it is not the media that’s the problem. 

Blaming the messenger is obtuse.

Find an journalist that reports what happened without trying to tell you how to feel about it. That will improve your perspective and balance emotions. 

“Trump said this.”
Or
“Xi Jing ping did that” 

The end.

This kind of thing. The commentary that journalists allow themselves these days is detrimental.
[comment]Are we now letting media headlines decide on how a leader should govern a nation?  


I get that journalism has now been muddied but this should not be used as a shield to avoid people in power for being accountable for their inaction.

[selftext]https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/andrew-yang-tech-entrepreneur-fears-automation-self-driving-cars/[comment]Does anyone else think the recent surge in left leaning media regarding Yang reeks of fear?
[comment]Going back to the cotton gin, automation has proven to be a net plus for creating jobs. While the nature of the economy and employment may change, ultimately new jobs will be created. Apparently, Yang thinks that we are too stupid and/or lazy to adapt. I wholly reject that notion.
[comment]He wants everyone to be a machine of the government. Just like Gabbard, and slightly different take on communism in the hopes that the dummys in the middle will vote fo them and take away Trumps lead.
[comment]I like how the article points to self driving vehicles putting truckers out of work. Airplanes have been able to fly themselves for the past decade, from take off to landing, but that hasn’t put pilots out of work. You will always need a human for the foreseeable future behind the wheel. During inclement weather the sensors on these vehicles stop working and a humans needs to take over. There is a plethora of other situations that robots can’t navigate through and needs a human on standby.
[comment]Make America Math Again
[comment]Not a fan of UBI, not at all.
But if it would serve as a replacement of other welfare programs, I’m all for that. You don’t need the same bloated bureaucy for it, for one. 

Milton Friedman talked about a negative income tax, it’s similar to that.
[comment]Yang's proposals fall apart without basically re-writing the constitution.

He was asked in a youtube video about how UBI would effect rental prices in places with already high rent.

His response was that with UBI people will move to rural, low cost of living places (what!?) and that he would change zoning requirements nationwide to make housing more dense.

You can't change zoning at the national level, and even if you could can you imagine the boondoggle if someone in Alabama is trying to decide how NYC should manage their land/development?

His plans make no real economic or practical sense once you go beyond a real base level.
[comment]Isn’t that called welfare and food stamps?
[comment]Yang has literally devoted his career to solving problems that affect ordinary Americans and he’s continuing to do so in an even bigger way as a candidate for president. That’s not the profile of a so-called snake oil salesman.
[comment]&gt; "[Yang] predicts that in a few years, 'we’re going to have a million truck drivers out of work,' and 'all hell breaks loose.'"

This is one of those progressive talking points which carries with it a planetarily sized load of irony. Democrats and many of the President's critics frequently denigrate him by telling us he's a fear-monger and that's how he gets by.

...yet almost the entirety of the Democrats' economic platform is anchored to the idea that society is operating under the looming threat of an unprecedented destruction of jobs. To quote Jeff Bezos: "...we are so unimaginative about what future jobs are going to look like and what they are going to be."

And just like how Henry Ford quipped that if he had asked what someone would've wanted to get around more quickly, they'd have said a faster horse, we are in yet another revolution. We've had several of these, but despite constant population growth, our country has always done well in employing our citizens. For Yang to assume that we're approaching a barrier in our economy's ability to generate employment, and hold to his claim so vehemently that he's leveraging it in attempt to implement reckless economic policies, is nothing short of a total desecration to the idea of human progress and creativity. 

In the dawn of internet-based journalism, if journalists in charge of their printing presses had the idea of a universal basic income, they would almost certainly have lobbied for a UBI system as well. Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press had no way of comprehending that you and I would ever be able to communicate from nearly anywhere in the world, with near-instantaneous delivery. He also wouldn't have ever known that one could be paid wirelessly for doing so. The destruction of the newspaper industry fostered the growth of an even more broad, even more democratic digital media sphere where anyone can report news and the industry as a whole is using far more diverse models; sometimes purely ad-funded, sometimes purely subscription-based. It varies, but there's a larger opportunity for people to become journalists than there ever was before.

There've been times throughout history where scientists, economists, and politicians have made predictions about development curves in their particular fields. They have all been routinely proven wrong. Arguably, the only wise move is to refrain from making any predictions, because human development has had a way of bringing consistent, aggregated improvement despite the astronomic population growth we've seen in the past century. 

Democrats like Yang are taking the position that long-term employment is under threat, but as I said above, that is a desecration to human progress. At best, it's an indulgence of laziness and display of Yang's own lack of imagination. At worst, it's a blatant political tactic to literally buy voters by threatening to change America's laws to help politicians, like himself, force those who create, work, and contribute, to pay the bills of those who do little or none of those things.
[comment]Man, I used to be a fan of National Review a decade back, but this is such a shit piece. Yang is proposing to make contingency plans for those whose jobs will be replaced by automation, which is inevitably coming and he supports. This is the furthest thing from him being "afraid of automation" and advocating against it.
[comment]Vegas has Yang at 12-1, basically considering him in third place now.
[comment]Do you get more money living in California because the gas is so high
[comment]No, we don't need more automaton.
[comment]I don’t know what is surprising about any of this. Democrats know people want free shit, so they pander for a cheap vote. They know the majority of Democratic voters aren’t intelligent enough, or simply don’t care, to question how it’s afforded. Most believe the government can “just print the money” because you know, inflation is not a thing. Plus the Democrats love having people dependent on the government. Same old song and dance. This is why you need your guns people. That way at least the government has to make a few considerations before they attempt to just come and take your shit so they can pay for this type of stuff
[comment]I only support UBI if it's a *replacement* of our horribly inept and corrupt welfare system, not in addition to it.

IMO UBI is more transparent than the cobbled together joke we have right now concerning welfare.
[comment]All the Dems are snake oil salesmen
[comment]I like UBI as a replacement, and while Andrew Yang keeps getting bullied to adding more and more welfare systems on top of UBI rather than replacing i'm counting on conservatives to let it pass only if those concessions be made which will likely be the case, especially if he gets the nomination and starts changing his message to more moderate.
[comment]I love how r/republican is so astroturfed that the upvoted comments *support* Yang and UBI, which is so obviously far from conservative beliefs i.e. $3 trillion per year in seized and redistributed wealth, except now not even to people that need it.<|endoftext|>

I know Germany started testing for a vaccine
[comment]I always thought vaccines took 5 or even 10+ years to develope. I'd be surprised if this one works
[comment]A: Do you really think Trump ordering a vaccine be made is the sole reason why it happened?
B: This is in Seattle, not Huntsville. They don’t need Trump to tell them what to do.
[comment]When they told me about the vaccine trials today
NPR reminded me that it’s not the same as other vaccines and it’s still a long way off before we can all have them and the president was wrong.
[comment]Is there an article? This is just a screenshot.
[comment]Thats so awesome! I can't wait for this to be over! I'm a wedding videographer and I had 3 clients calling me telling me their wedding's are cancelled. And the thing is I don't feel right keeping their whole deposit even thou this is my main source of income. This year sucks for business people.
[comment]First Clinical trial = vaccine??? Vaccines AT LEAST a year away and that would be absolutely crazy fast. Also Trump owns moderna???
[comment]I sincerely hope a fast and successful safe vaccine is available. I’m old enough to remember the swine flu of 1976, and what happened then.  If you don’t know about the mass push to vaccinate all Americans, take some time to read up.
[comment]Honest question. If a company in Massachusetts developed this, what does it have to do with Trump?
[comment]Isn't vaccination a libtard Democrat scheme to make white Christians' children autistic?
[comment]That seems odd.

Trump recently tried to buy the german company CureVac because they are working on an antidote. Trump was planning to use this antidote exclusively for Amierica.  
But the company told him to go fck himself
[comment]Ride Trump a little harder

[comment]I hope USA finds the vaccine first. That should put eurofags and democrats to their place.
[comment]Fingers crossed it works.
[comment]Will be quick but expect 12 months before we see a vaccine. Clinical trials take years
[comment]Wait, why are we developing vaccines for a "liberal hoax"? /s :P
[comment]He’s doing a phenomenal job with this.
[comment]its just a phase 1 trial. No real efficacy data is expected from this study.

Its basically a test on healthy ppl to see if this vaccine is safe , what kind of toxicities will it induce, and see if ppl don't immediately die from complications. 

TBH, significance of this is overblown. Majority of test drugs go into phase 1s and never make it out to warrant further investigation. 


When they start large phase 3 trials, then we should be talking
[comment]The vaccine won't be ready until people are looked at one year in the future at least because they may have unknown side effects. Hopefully they get it right and these people trying it become immune.<|endoftext|>

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm about to get sick

From watchin' my TV

Been checkin' out the news

Until my eyeballs fail to see

I mean to say that every day

Is just another rotten mess

And when it's gonna change, my friends

Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot...

I seen the cops out on the street

Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff

And chokin' in the heat

Listened to reports

About the whisky passin' 'round

Seen the smoke &amp; fire

And the market burnin' down

Watched while everybody

On his street would take a turn

To stomp and smash and bash and crash

And slash and bust and burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Well you can cool it,

You can heat it...

'Cause, baby, I don't need it...

Take your TV tube and eat it

'N all that phony stuff on sports

'N all the unconfirmed reports

You know I watched that rotten box

Until my head began to hurt

From checkin' out the way

The newsmen say they get the dirt

Before the guys on channel so-and-so

And further they assert

That any show they'll interrupt

To bring you news if it comes up

They say that if the place blows up

They'll be the first to tell

Because the boys they got downtown

Are workin' hard and doin' swell,

And if anybody gets the news

Before it hits the street,

They say that no one blabs it faster

Their coverage can't be beat

And if another woman driver

Gets machine-gunned from her seat

They'll send some joker with a brownie

And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Hey you know something people

I'm not black

But there's a whole lots a times

I wish I could say I'm not white

Well, I seen the fires burnin'

And the local people turnin'

On the merchants and the shops

Who used to sell their brooms and mops

And every other household item

Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em

And they say it served 'em right

Because a few of them are white,

And it's the same across the nation

Black &amp; white discrimination

They're yellin' "; You can't understand me!";

And all the other crap they hand me

In the papers and TV

'N all that mass stupidity

That seems to grow more every day

Each time you hear some nitwit say

He wants to go and do you in

Because the color of your skin

Just don't appeal to him

(No matter if it's black or white)

Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we gotta sit around at home

And watch this thing begin

But I bet there won't be many left

To see it really end

'Cause the fire in the street

Ain't like the fire in my heart

And in the eyes of all these people

Don't you know that this could start

On any street in any town

In any state if any clown

Decides that now's the time to fight

For some ideal he thinks is right

And if a million more agree

There ain't no great society

As it applies to you and me

Our country isn't free

And the law refuses to see

If all that you can ever be

Is just a lousy janitor

Unless your uncle owns a store

You know that five in every four

Just one amount and nothin' more

Don't watch the rats go across the floor

And make up songs about being poor

Blow you harmonica son!

[comment]Something people need to be aware of is that rioters don't care about Floyd or any other victim of police brutality.  They don't care about race or injustices or inequality.  They are violent criminals who just look for an excuse to vandalize and do violence.  Rioters simply want to riot, and they'll do so if you give them even the most ludicrous of reasons.  

Do no let these idiots ever convince you that they give a damn about human life, dignity, liberty, freedoms, or justice.  These are the barbarians.
[comment]CNN wanted a riot and pushed for a riot only thing is CNN wanted somebody else to be targeted.
[comment]What would make them target CNN? They seek "truth" from them. Did they side with the former officer or something?

[comment]Incite racial wars and hysteria. It just might end up biting you in the ass. I just love cnn is acknowledging it happened. But calling it protests. The moment a protest crosses the threshold of violence or destruction. It’s not a protest. MLK god rest his soul is rolling in his grave.

[comment]It amuses me all the people posting about how peaceful protest haven't changed anything. Which is why they're rioting now.

has violent riots ever change the hearts of people so they don't hate anymore?

the only thing that will stop racism is time and people changing. 

And the only thing that'll change police involved shootings. Is less crime so the police don't feel the need to reach for their guns so fast.

[comment] This was a staged event to **put the idea of cannibalism into the minds of the people**. What is more shocking than the idea of cannibalism, **but the act of doing this to an innocent baby**? With one fell swoop, **both** extremes have now been put into the minds of the American populace. While obviously many are horrified, the idea is now however **firmly entrenched** in their psyche's as a future possibility. This is all part of the recent push by these freaks to normalize cannibalism.

She is a bubble headed wind bag who can be ignored
[comment]this is some deep thinking chess moves from the far left

1. promote ignorance of COVID contagiousness thus increasing the amount infected

2. MSM flip rhetoric with hyper fear over disease

3. state POTUS was wrong not MSM for lack of immediate and complete solution to problem

4. instill division through race relations by connecting disease to racism 

5. make POC so scared they dont seek treatment thus adding to death toll

6. added death toll supports claim that the POTUS is racist

if it wasnt so stupid it would be brilliant, tinfoil hats around boys
[comment]Smooth brain takes are nothing new for AOC but I don’t see how even if that is true, how is it Trumps fault if people are too scared to go to the hospital. I mean if she is talking about illegal aliens then she shouldn’t call them New Yorkers because they’re not

[comment]Why is people still listening to her after her failed new green deal
[comment]I an sorry but is this a place for honest thoughtful discussion of our party and our values or is this just a place for parroting the nonsense that makes us forget the value of critical thinking? I for one do not equate Trumpism with Republican values or conservatism and I think maybe we’d be better off running somebody other than him. If being personally responsible for our own actions and keeping the money we earn is going to continue to be relevant, I think we should act accordingly, and let our actions reflect our values. 

We can do far better than Trump and we are really in a pickle. I dont think anyone takes Biden seriously, but its looking more and more like Trump knows how to win but not how to govern. And Biden nay hire folks smart enough to see past Trumps BS. Trump thinks he is doing a great job. If we limit him to a one term Presidency then we can show America we care for everyone, and Biden wont stand a chance. If Trump loses and things get suddenly better, who do you think will get the blame? It wont be the Democrats.

[selftext]https://babylonbee.com/news/in-genius-move-trump-supports-impeachment-forcing-democrats-to-oppose-it[comment]So crazy it just might work
[comment]Actually impeachment is the best thing at this point and could lead to a landslide.  The Democrats have had their fun with this little dog and pony show to get cute snippets, but their impeachment vote will be a nightmare.  It will pass, but be close on purely partisan lines which has never happened and  looks very bad.  

Then it goes to the Senate, where suddenly Reps control the timeline, rules and other shenanigans.  They can subpoena Schiff and others.  They can do it all during peak Dem primary days. They can drag it on and include the upcoming IG and Dunham reports, which will be a very bad look for Dems. And still ultimately vote against it. 

Pelosi was smart, this was why she never wanted it. She’s cornered by some young, idealistic but very stupid progressives. .
[comment]Honestly “impeached by democrats” would be a killer campaign slogan for Trump.
[comment]You know that Babylonbee is a satire site, not unlike The Onion.
[comment]Uh babylonbee?
[comment]"Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term."

If that isn't the funniest shit Nancy has every said in regards to Trumps presidential term then i don't know what it. LMAO. I don't think any democrat knew how to respond to that. It won't pass in the senate however. They would need all democratic, both independent and 20 republican senate votes to pass the articles of impeachment at the senate level.
[comment]I'm not a fan of what he said during the call, but I'm also not naive enough to think that politics is not completely quid pro quo.  Dems were obsessed with finding something wrong with the 2016 election, you would think they would be happy Trump wanted to see of there was anything to those conspiracy rumors.  Ukraine wanted a WH visit and to purchase more missiles.  My problem with the call is that Trump specifically asked about Biden. If he had spoken about the stalled Barisma investigation as just that, no issue here. But he shot himself in the foot by talking about Biden. That being said, there was nothing illegal with the call, and I bet if we declassified the phone calls of every other POTUS we'd see this same kind of crap on almost every one. "Oh you want this? Cool, then do this for us and it's good." And before I get jumped on, I get that Dems look at this as a "but Trump wanted something for personal gain because Joe is is political rival". Ok, half of the damn country is Trump's political rival, and Joe may be the front runner in some polls, but guess what? Hillary had a 90% chance of winning. I don't like nepotism, especially when it looks so bad. Did Joe and his son do anything illegal? Not that I can see, but if Barisma did use Hunter's name to get WH access, that should be looked into because I know that if it was a GOP kid, I would want it looked into. It blows my mind that Dems are ok with looking the other way on that.  Look, politics sucks. They're all selfish jerks. Trump's kids who work in the WH do so for free, Trump himself doesn't take a salary. Trump's kids are also educated in business, and are in industries where they have life-long experience.  Sorry for the rant, I'm just tired off all the self-righteous peeps on r/politics who thing the big bad Republicans are just evil incarnate and that we are too red pilled to be anything other than dumb followers.
[comment]The article is from a new satire website... It’s not a real article.
[comment]Sadly, that would probably actually work on them.
[comment]The fact that this article hit the top of r/ republican without folks even noticing it was satire just made my morning.
[comment]Everyone seems to dismiss the fact that Sleepy Joe bragged on National TV about something that appears to have a serious conflict of interest. Trump asked for Ukraine to look into Biden’s claims. Just because he is running for President doesn’t make him immune from investigation, especially when he practically confessed publicly to his actions. 

Creepy Joe has opened a can of worms and Impeachment is a weak attempt to shift the focus off Biden, the DNC, and the fact that Epstein didn’t kill himself.

It appears to have had the opposite effect, Biden and many others will be discredited and then disgraced. I see Biden as the likely sacrifice thrown to the wolves to stop anyone from looking deeper into who was in bed with Barisma...

We shall see
[comment]Tbh, it kind of like there's this kid at one of those win a prize games at a carnival, and he gets very excited about a certain prize. Then, after losing the game, he goes into a small tantrum saying stuff like how he didn't want it anyway, how lame it is and etc.

[comment]Wow a Democrat acknowledging our coexistence as Americans. Very rare but a nice change of pace
[comment]She was the most likable out of all of them
[comment]I like that she's dividing the Dems and throwing out red pills. Yes, I am well aware of her stance on rifles.
[comment]Liberals can't stand people that aren't interested in burning all Conservatives at the stake. They want an insane socialist who will take everyone's guns and have a quota on abortions every week. 

If they didn't, they wouldn't be interested in Beto, Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders.
[comment]Only candidate that could beat Trump and they wont elect her.
[comment]I will not vote Democratic in 2020, but if I were to do so, she would be the one to get my vote.   She is the only one up there speaking even an ounce of reason.  Props for throwing shade at CNN and NYT too.
[comment]I see a gun grabbing nazi, not an american politican though.
[comment]She’s singing a different tune now.  But still a communist.
[comment]First let me say I'm a Democrat. I'm here after searching reddit and trying to understand the backlash I'm hearing regarding her in the media. 

Out of all the candidates, Tulsi is the only one who makes sense to me. When she speaks I constantly find myself thinking "yes, exactly!" I have a hard time getting behind ANY of the other Democratic candidates because their policies and/or promises just seem unrealistic and some outright looney.

Now to see all the hate being thrown her way, especially from the left, it just boggles my mind and makes me disheartened. 

Long story short, I starting to think Trump will win in 2020.
[comment]She might be the most sane and least socialist of the bunch but she's still left on all her issues and I imagine like most dems she would go much further left once in office. Trump 2020.
[comment]Tulsi is a decent person. I don’t feel that way about any other democratic candidate.
[comment]Pls upvote me so I can continue to post on socialist led subreddits.
[comment]Mom 😍😍😍😍
[comment]Don't be fooled though... I copied this from another sub, but the info is off her own web site:

Things she supports that are crazy:
1.Federal minimum wage increased to $15 per hour
2.Supports reparations.
3.College should be free.
4.Eliminate the electoral college.
5.Close down nuclear power plants.
6."Assault weapon" ban.
7.Government sponsored universal health care.
8.Expanding DACA.
9.Supports more stringent "climate change" legislations.

Things she supports that aren't crazy:
1.Negotiating prices for Medicare.
2.Stoping the spying of the US government on it's citizens.
3.Ending the war on drugs.
[comment]Aaaaand cancelled.
[comment]It’s amazing how much politics has changed in the last ten or so years. Heck I was a Democrat until 2016. The insanity that the Party showed during those elections and this next one is crazy and pushed people like me away from the party.
[comment]“...that I want to disarm and make vulnerable to future incoming Democrat voters.”
-Gabbard, later off-mic probably.
[comment]Lol look at her now trying to cuddle up to Republicans
[comment]I like her but yang is so awkward. Nobody’s raising their hands when he tells them to. When he hits the mic it’s just weird and really uncomfortable.
[comment]I like her more and more. I mean aside from the completely venal, *she's hot*, kind of thing. She seems to be a mensch.
[comment]She should switch parties.
[comment]She's the only candidate that doesn't always sound like a blithering idiot.
[comment]She is the least corrupt of the dems
[comment]The only democrat worthy of our time to listen to. The rest are bar shit insane.
[comment]Great rhetoric! I love it from either side of the aisle. When there is disagreement, our politicians should focus more on being a committee that seeks to find the best answer to the problem that divides us, rather trying to arbitrarily "win" some argument. This is a prime example!
[comment]People can trying to portray her as the most reasonable Democrat in the room, but as long as she is pushing for huge climate change bills, government-run healthcare, and eliminating the electoral college then she's just as much a nutjob as the rest of them.
[comment]Good for her. If she rolls back a few other things she’s said she’ll easily be my favorite Dem candidate
[comment]Honestly she’s the only candidate I’m worried about. She’s the only one who would have a chance in hell of beating Trump.
[comment]Of all the Democrats running, I personally like her the best. She seems down to Earth and sensible.
[comment]i respect her because she is a kernel in the army<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>[title]Immigrants Should Not Be on Welfare
[selftext]https://www.heritage.org/welfare/commentary/immigrants-should-not-be-welfare[comment]I agree
[comment]Agreed
[comment] President Trump is being criticized by Democrats for his most recent immigration reform proposal. Under hist new policy proposal, immigrants who receive welfare benefits could be denied green cards or visas. Democrats quickly labeled this policy racist and against American values. Democrats are wrong about this latest piece of the Trump administrations immigration reform efforts. President Trump is right, for most of American history immigrants coming to the United States didn't receive welfare handouts. For almost 150 years immigrants could be denied entry if immigration officials believed they would become a “public charge.” Immigrants had to be economically self-sufficient. Wave after wave of immigrants have achieved the American dream by becoming self-sufficient, even when they came here with nothing. Most economists agree that legal immigration is net contributor to the economy. Now, not all immigrants are beneficial and there are "bad hombres" that immigrate here, but the benefits of legal immigration writ large outweigh these costs to most Americans. This is largely because most legal immigrants are risk takers who come to the United States between the ages of 16 and 40, when they are likely to be at the start of their working years though the peak of their earning years. Skilled immigrants provide the highest benefits, thus President Trump is right when he proposes that we should change our immigration process to favor merit (similar to the policies of Canada and Australia) to ensure that we get the best, brightest, and hardest working immigrants regardless of race, origin, or ethnicity. There should be no welfare benefits for immigrants until they become citizens. Immigrants can become honest, hard working, patriotic American citizens and share in our freedoms, opportunity, and prosperity, but you cannot receive taxpayer welfare benefits. You and your sponsors are responsible for your well being. If an immigrant falls on tough times, then family members, employers, or other sponsors should be held responsible to help them get their feet back on the ground, not the American taxpayers. With entitlement spending massively increasing with trillions of dollars of future deficits in these programs, we cannot afford to allow foreigners to come to America to collect our generous benefits. There is strong [evidence](https://cis.org/Report/Welfare-Use-Legal-and-Illegal-Immigrant-Households) that welfare has the same debilitating dependency effects on ‎immigrants that it has on natural born Americans. Welfare saps them of their [economic drive](https://www.dailysignal.com/2015/08/01/how-welfare-spending-hurts-the-people-its-supposed-to-help/), which is exactly what makes immigrants valuable in the first place. Most immigrants don't abuse our welfare system, and government handouts are not the magnet that attracts them to the United States in the first place. But some immigrants do abuse the system and social service agencies sign them up for welfare handouts. There will be no shortage of ambitious immigrants aspiring to be model American citizens even without welfare. If freedom and opportunity are not enough reason to legally immigrate to the America, then those who would refuse to come under these new conditions probably are not the ones we need anyway.
[comment]And people on welfare should be cleaning trash off our streets, painting and planting trees instead of doing nothing.
[comment]Left this left that...no matter what we do with immigrants you will never be satisfied

Immigrants in America will always be a thing so get over it
[comment]I didn’t read the article so don’t behead me but it’s talking about illegal immigrants right?
[comment]Immigrants shouldn't even be immigrants, they should be back where they belong.  The jobs they are doing now will mostly be done by robots in a decade or two, so even if they are working now they'll be on welfare then.
[comment]Technically illegal and legal immigrants are not allowed to use social services, until they become citizens.

In the process of becoming a legal citizen, whoever is your sponsor is responsible for paying the government back for any social service you use.(except for stuff like public roads, police, schools etc)

Problem is that the government doesn’t pursue these people who go on welfare or food stamps cause it’s not worth their time/money
[comment]Nobody should be on welfare.  

Charity &gt; coercion.
[comment]And non-veterans
[comment]What if private charity isn’t enough to sustain people like the disabled or orphans or the severely mentally ill?
[comment]10-4
[comment]All people getting government assistance should be required to do something for the public. Even people on disability can do something. Theres a girl with down syndrome who bags groceries at my local store. Meanwhile my lazy ass mother in law gets a check because she ate so many twinkies that she requires a scooter to get around. I say she can shove a damn scooter with that cart.
[comment]FUCK NO!
[comment]Jesus Christ, this viewpoint is outdated by decades. Illegal immigrants are the backbone of our economy. Alabama had some of the strictest immigration policies, but they couldn't sustain it. The economy hurt too much because buisnesses couldn't find cheap labor. It's proven again and again, immigrants are a net benefit. Immigrants shouldn't be the ones you are mad at, they don't have any power. Be mad at corporations only care about money.
[comment]This country was founded on the principles of immigration, to take in people from all around the world. 

Welfare is killing the core of American principles because the more welfare you have, the stricter immigration protocols you need. If you remove welfare, it wouldn't matter how many immigrants we take, it would only serve to increase our population multiplier and help us compete with population giants like China and India.

[comment]Pigs don’t care what color you are, we are their enemies.
[comment]It's a very disturbing article. Good police are invaluable, and bad police are dangerous.

But a single video to prove a point about race is misleading. The best study I've seen on the topic is here:

*An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force*

TLDR, there is a higher rate of non-lethal use of force on black Americans. The rate of shootings is about equal for between black and white Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On non-lethal uses of force, there are racial differences –sometimes quite large –in police use of force, even after accounting for a large set of controls designed to account for important contextual and behavioral factors at the time of the police-civilian interaction. Interestingly, as use of force increases from putting hands on a civilian to striking them with a baton, the overall probability of such an incident occurring decreases dramatically but the racial difference remains roughly constant. **Even when officers report civilians have been compliant and no arrest was made, blacks are 21.3 (0.04) percent more likely to endure some form of force**. Yet, **on \[officer-involved shootings\] we are unable to detect any racial differences** in either the raw data or when accounting for controls.
[comment]So are we going to be having race wars every summer before a presidential election now, like the Olympics, except they don’t get canceled?
[comment]But which ones burn down cities every election year?
[comment]Ok so let's do something about cops killing our citizens of all races.
[comment]Yeah, Americans know. No ones falling for this nonsense. Its 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like Novembers going to be a breeze.
[comment]Yeah, happens to every race. One particular one more than most. Also are you trying to justify this by saying it happens to every race? Or are you saying that because it's such a problem now is the time to work together to fight against it?
[comment]You're statistically more likely to be killed by a cop if you're white than if you're black. This whole "it's open season on blacks for cops" is such bullshit and it's blatantly obvious
[comment]Wow and no riots, no candle-light vigils really makes me think
[comment]Expect whites down burn down entire cities when it happens
[comment]The problem is far bigger than just race. Race is the excuse many of these dirtbags use to hide their culpability.

Remind me again, what party has run Dallas for decades?
[comment]Its not just black people protesting. I really hope people see that.
[comment]Only in this case there were no riots. No reportage. No looting. No protests. No nothing. Why? Because he was white. I am sick and fuckin tired of the Caucasian race being trampled on or fought against or ignored. If we’re all to coexist peacefully together then all lives matter, not just black. Or brown. Or whatever color you are.
[comment]Nothing new. So what about the tens of thousands of innocent people murdered annually due to gang violence? That's ok right? That doesn't deserve any reaction or critical attention? More people lose their life prematurely due to gang violence than police brutality could ever touch. And this has been a trend for decades. 

I know people will want a source so this is statistical value for one location in one year. Long story short. 700+ murdered, 4k shootings and this is from just one location in one year. This isn't taking into account for the injuried due to gang related shootings. So just imagine if you start adding up all death due to gang related shootings around the United States, the numbers would astronomical in comparison to police brutality deaths. I'm not advocating for what this cop did but this info starts to shed a little light into the underlining issues and how this is mostly ignored.

https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-homicides-data-tracker-htmlstory.html

Downvote all you like, but this is the reality of gang violence.
[comment]To be fair cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by cocaine and the stress of the altercation. Cops need to be retrained.
[comment]Wife was up late with me last night/this morning, talking about this very thing.

White people are expected to die and be forgotten.
That's why these things come and go.

Until we start doing the same shit, burning down news stations for printing bullshit lies, they won't respect us and this will keep happening.

That, or just have a lot of kids, vote responsibly, and pray every day for a miracle.
[comment]So my question is, what happened to these police? Did any of them get investigated? Are they being brought up on charges? How often do these sorts of things happen and it doesn't get reported? Why was that elderly Indian man killed and there was barely a peep- are Indians no longer "brown" people? Why didn't the media report the FBI was investigating from the instant it came out? Could it be the media has a narrative they want us to follow, and we're all falling for it? Those hashtags that have 20 names, why have I only heard of maybe 5? Why is this story over a year old and I'm only learning of it now, when the same exact thing happened to someone else?  Maybe it isn't a race thing. Maybe its a media playing the public thing.
[comment]An attack on one group of citizens is an attack on all of us. It doesn’t matter who is suffering unjustly. If there is unjust suffering then it needs to be taken care of. We had wars about this, people ! 

Don’t let anyone divide us !
[comment]Privatize law enforcement along with everything else.
[comment]We can now deduce that cops have no regard for human life
[comment]Do you guys remember when we rioted in the streets after Tony Timpa’s death? Yeah, neither do I. So weird.
[comment]I find it very telling that this is posted on r/republican and also reposted from r/libertarian
[comment]Police brutality is a real thing, because humans are humans, it’s not always a race thing. The real problem is the politicians and media who want every incident to be about race. What happens to these cities of the police force closes, hint..l just watch the rioters....err I mean peaceful protesters.
[comment]This is not a movement about black lives mattering more. 

Black lives matter *enough* to address the lethal culture creeping through law enforcement unchecked. 

There are a few bad cops that abuse their power and are acting as judge,jury,and executioner. They have multiple accounts of inappropriate interactions with the citizens they are sworn to protect. There are many officers who are aware of this, witness it and instead of fighting to end it they stand by their brother in blue to protect him in solidarity.  

I don’t agree with looting and burning and violence. But I completely agree with the protests and the messaging. 

There are good cops but they failed to reform a system that is killing people.
[comment]Go on and try the solidarity approach.

[comment]No one is saying that this ONLY happens to black people, they are upset that it DISPROPORTIONATELY happens to black people. The peaceful protests (not the violent ones) are against police brutality that is hurting the black community. The white man's death was a tragedy...

This is the United States. If I want to go out and put myself at risk of a “deadly disease”, then I should have the right to do that. Anybody who is at risk of dying should stay home while the rest of us go on about our lives.

This is not 1984, COVID is not a hoax, and you’re not Paul Revere. 

Seriously, y’all are making us all look like idiots. 

I’m not saying don’t open the economy. I said from day 1 that quarantines were unsustainable financially and would wreck the economy. I also said I didn’t think the death rate was anywhere near 3.4%. 

But the fact remains that it is highly contagious and overruns hospitals. Go look up what happened in Albany Ga. That’s what will happen if we do absolutely nothing. 

And my point is that there are many conservatives who advocating for exactly that - go back to the way it was before with zero precautions. That’s a very stupid mindset. 

I think opening back up, with common sense social distancing is the only way.

Though Jefferson was an "essential worker" he sent his family into quarantine, and indeed lost close family to the yellow fever outbreak of 1793.

[selftext]https://www.theepochtimes.com/democrats-would-rather-blame-trump-than-china-for-the-pandemic_3309825.html[comment]They would blame Trump if they personally overcooked toast.
[comment]Sad but very true
[comment]Some good things / decisions that have happened..... Travel restrictions to China, expediting clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as possible treatment, massive hospital ships in NY and LA, and stimulus checks for most americans. 

I think US leadership is trying. I think Trump was trying to be hopeful and not panic or act rashly on information he couldn't verify or didn't trust. No one is perfect. 

However, the WHO leadership refused to identify that the virus was doing the damage it had done within China and declare a worldwide crisis until 30 Jan, likely after the virus had already spread throughout the world. The WHO must have known human to human transmission was occurring within China, as the reported cases reached 11,600 and deaths reached 260. It is also well known now that China Iikely lied about how many died to cover up how bad it was, and the WHO went along with it.

[comment]This sub is really starting to pander.
[comment]Why do i break out in hives whenever i see her ugly mug ?
[comment]If you want to know who is in the pocket of the Chinese Communist Party just listen to who is using Chinese Communist Party talking points verbatim to attack the President of the United States and the American citizens.
[comment]Unless Donald Trump had a frickin’ lab where he invented the damn virus, there’s no way he’s responsible for it. People are so stupid. Yellowstone can blow its top and those who survive will say it’s his fault.
[comment]China invests in silicon valley and big tech.

Silicon valley and big tech donate to Democrats

Democrats give favorable treatment and cover for China.

China invests in silicon valley and big tech....
[comment]Shouldn’t we be blaming Putin in that case?
[comment]I wish trump was harder on China earlier about testing and being transparent. Along with that, I wish he’d, like Fauci, would admit his mistake of downplaying the virus. I’m happy with the budget cut he imposed on the WHO. They deserve no penny from us as they were knowingly allowing China lie to every other country and report false data. The CCP is responsible for a lot of deaths.
[comment]r/Republican has been taken over by liberals and mean while I can’t post a thing lol. I think I’m done with Reddit.
[comment]That’s a surprise to who?
[comment]They blamed Trump for having an extra scoop of ice cream at a White House dinner; I mean what do you expect from a party that is led by mentally inept people?!
[comment]Fuck DemocRATS
[comment]"I blame Ford for building shitty cars and not the mechanic who didnt do their job when the check engine light was on."
[comment]How exactly do the leftist trolls here square their belief that Donald Trump is personally responsible for the Pandemic, with the fact that most Americans both think he's doing a good job AND that China is primarily responsible for this?
[comment]At this point its a Mad libs game.

"Democrats Would Rather Blame Trump Than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
[comment]It’s probably because they have ties to China
[comment]I would love to see Trump do and say the opposite of what he really wants. Just to see the Libs attack his view. Then say you know what, I think I changed my mind.
[comment]They could have done much more sooner
[comment]The American people have very little control over China. We can point out the failings of Xi and his authoritarian regime but there is very little recourse for us. 

Trump is the head of the US government and his response has been poor. We as Americans have the ability to change our own government and therefore, criticism of our own is a more productive conversation to have because we actually have the ability to fix things on our end.
[comment]I identify myself as a democrat but seeing people blaming everything on Trump instead of recognising that China and WHO should take most of the responsibilities on the pandemic hurts my brain
[comment]On January 24, Trump tweeted: "China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!
[comment]It really shows how terrible they are. Just the fact that they would rather throw blame around rather than help fix the issue.
[comment]U.S. and its allies should boycott all Chinese goods, withdraw all companies from China, make them pay for all the damages they have caused in the current crisis, recognize Taiwan as the only legitimate 'China', and support separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. These are my five points to hold China accountable for causing this pandemic. Any other points would be appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]California... A great place to be a Republican
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/suvtgjxtzby31.png[comment]There are many roads to success in California, most of them lead out of state.
[comment]How tolerant.
[comment]"Remind me who the facists are..."

People on all sides.
[comment]I live in California. I have many ultra liberal friends.  


I do not doubt this happens AT ALL. It is just surprising sometimes because I have mayyyyyybe met 1 or 2 people that were this zealous in their political beliefs to take things that far.
[comment]Can’t come out as an “R” word in CA.  Can’t wear Red hats or put stickers on your car or else vandalized.  Get called racist even though you’re a minority.  Tolerant non violent left.
[comment]I’m sorry if this guy is having troubles socializing and private life matters(kids, wife, etc), because that all sounds f’d up. 

...but losing major clients and countless projects? It doesn’t sound like you “came out as a republican”. It sounds like you are actively injecting politics into your business dealings, and people think it’s unprofessional. 

If you were a civil engineer, I would want to know if the bridge is safe- not if you think the funding came from the wrong place, etc. Why would you be talking about politics with clients? I would recommend avoiding politics with any client in any business, unless of course, it’s political. 

Alternatively, it could just be correlation instead of causation. Maybe the economy is slowing and funds are drying up, but he thinks it’s because of a recent post he made? Just seems too far fetched to not have more detail. 

But again, that other stuff is f’d if true.
[comment]I mean the whole country *HATES* California so I wouldn't be surprised this is their way of coping. It's their safe space hahaha
[comment]I left Ca about 9 years ago, best choice of my life. Born and raised there, and that place is seriously going to shit, I’ll visit my family and after 2 days I can’t wait to get home where people are normal.
[comment]“Come out as a republican” what the fuck does that even mean lol. I knew Califoria was shit but damn.
[comment]In other news a man on a purple bicycle has shot an arrow at a homeless person! Skyrim hold guards say “we are still looking for him.” 

Next: Homeless man has arrow in the knee!
[comment]A civil war is coming. It'll be a war based in an opposition of philosophies. If I were a religious man, I'd say it's a precursor to Armeggedon, the "last battle" before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.
[comment]Honestly this is so sad. And I guarantee you people were commenting on this, calling him either a baby for tweeting this, or a nazi.
[comment]When is Calexit happening again?
[comment]You shouldn’t have to “come out” as republican
[comment]I grew up in California. Went to a mexican roman catholic church every sunday with my best friends family, despite not being a catholic or speaking Spanish. Went to more cinceyetas (spelling) than I can count. 

2016, I now live in canada and I lose all my friends of 15+ years I went to kindergarten to high school with and am now branded a Mexican hating racist.

Fuck the left, I want my friends back.
[comment]Come to Las Vegas.

Still a blue state, but much more libertarian and business friendly.
[comment]Thank god we let Jon Stewart tell a generation they're intellectual for voting for one of Americas two parties.

&amp;#x200B;

Well that that and vapid libertarian voters.
[comment]Move to Nebraska.  Not to Omaha, Lincoln, Lexington, Scottsbluff, or Schuyler though.  GI, Bellevue, North Platte maybe.  Only certain parts.  Chadron, Hastings, Kearney, Beatrice, Columbus, Fremont, and Norfolk yes, absolutely.
[comment]Honestly, no one gives a damn here in California if you’re Republican or not....I mean, you might get playfully teased, but no one is going to do all of things that this bloke alleged.  Now, if he has a bunch “Obama is Muslim” type of bumper stickers on his vehicle and has a giant red MAGA flag flying in front of his front yard, then ya, I can see what he’s alleging happening.
[comment]The orwellian puppet-master dems have got the sheeple dems trained well.
[comment]I drove around the Bay Area all summer in 2004 with a Bush/Cheney sticker on my truck and no one bothered me, but I did have to intervene to protect a woman in San Rafael with the same sticker from a crazed Kerry voter who was about to assault her. I threw him in a dumpster.
[comment]I see plenty of republicans in San Francisco. This guy is lying
[comment]I’m a CA Republican and I have Dem friends. We just don’t talk about it.
[comment]You just live in the wrong county. That's all. For example, Riverside and San Diego counties are based. It's very calm politically.
[comment]Usually when  see Republicans on Facebook, they just meme about Democrats and maybe a few insults. When I see Democrats post, it's a speech of how terrible Republicans are and why they are pieces of shit and a whole slew of things.
[comment]In the past both Dems and Reps annoyed me but now days its definitely the left. I might not agree with evething on the right but at least they are not bat shit crazy like the left
[comment]None if that behavior strikes me as particularly fascistic. It fulfills many qualities of it but appears to lack nationalism. It looks more like aggressive tribalism than an attitude of fascism.
[comment]Victim complex
[comment]So sorry for you and the rest of your family..  We literally face harm just wearing a MAGA hat to the grocery store.  We’ll beat them again and they’ll still be screaming into the sky and petting their baby llamas, for years to come.
[comment]I keep a very low profile in SoCal. I avoid political discussions with people I know and just let my vote do the talking.
[comment]I was talking with a girl and we were going to meet soon.  Everything was going so well and I liked her. I knew she was a Liberal, no surprise, its CA.  

She made a comment about how she hoped the dems could impeach trump and referenced Ukraine so I brought up Uncle Joe.  

She confirmed I was Republican and said "I don't associate with Trump supporters."  

I don't understand the people who live in their bubble and avoid people who arent Liberal.   It blows my mind.
[comment]It's all good. Just pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
[comment]Move man
[comment]I am sorry to hear about the treatment you and your family are receiving. Stay safe! If people bring it up I always throw out the law of the 3 unmentionable topics in public. No talk of sex, religion or politics jokingly and try to lighten the mood. Sometimes it works lol! Well anyways, I wanted to right you to try and be of some help after reading your post. I looked into moving to California this past year and after all the research I've done on the subject, I find myself questioning on why I really even wanted to head out west in the 1st place... See here in Erie, PA, there is lots to do and see too! Its all around you just like in Ca! Its just a short drive to Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo and so many other towns and places for a weekend get-a-way or day trips. If you like the outdoors we have the beauty of all 4 seasons here, there are so many hiking trails to explore, creeks for fishing and land for hunting. The best part about living in Erie is that it sits right on Lake Erie! With the breathtaking sunsets and its endless number of beaches! The cost of living is way less and it has lots of schools/colleges. I couldnt afford much out in Ca I come to find out. Living here, one could even afford lakefront property with private beach access, for a fraction of the money.  Again, I am so sorry to hear about you and your family having a hard time with being there. In this State you shouldn't be bullied about your beliefs and traditions. I urge you to at least check it out, worst comes to worst, you can always go back right?
[comment]this is genuinely gut wrenching
[comment]I'm personally a Democrat, with many Republican friends, (I just like to see both sides of everything, thats why I'm here in the first place) and I cannot believe this. To take politics to such a level is completely irrational. I mean, I've disagreed with my friends on many occasions. But I've never thought to bring any sort of harm or anything to them. And what is the point? If you disagree with someone's agenda, then why would you fuel them with dirt on your party? Oh, I want more people to agree with my idea, so let's do all this stupid stuff to make us look like even bigger idiots. Sometimes I wonder how I associate with any political party at all.
[comment]Its crazy!!!! A guy I met here basically thinks this way. If you support trump you're a racist... it's like what?! I really want to move out when I can! Maybe to a swing state and help flip it Red just because..
[comment]What a snowflake!
[comment]So fucked up
[comment]Maybe this says more about how awful Republicans have become lately if coming out as one can give you this much hatred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]First meme i’ve made
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/gp94ddw0gzx41.jpg[comment]I'd argue that other Trump supporters just don't go there, but fair enough.
[comment]You have set the bar high.....great post
[comment]One day a persistent injection of reality will come to that collection of Chinese communist party shills.  But first, let us push for the banning of Chinese Communist party entities from investing in the socalist media platforms in the west and accessing socalist media comment sections.  It is a national security issue.
[comment]Some cunt started trying to dox me and harrassed me in my PMs with the mods not caring, so I had to make a new account. Fuck this propaganda trash heap
[comment]Do you know the context of this scene?
[comment]I secretly go the the sub and like every conservative post.
[comment]this sub makes me happy that their are more people who share my beliefs, and gives me hope that blue can’t turn everything to shit
[comment]Dont besmerch my boys like that
[comment]The fact that you used Trailer Park Boys makes it a whole lot better
[comment]They’re a socialist hellhole
[comment]We can tell cuz it’s not funny
[comment]I get like three thousand dms from 12 year old trannies every day saying: “ youre such a disgusting and horrible person did you know that?“ and all sorts of insults lol. And ive given up on r/politics, theres really no point in visiting it, it just makes me angry
[comment]I don't need rocket appliances to know that /r/politics is f*cked

[comment]Excellent work sir. It shall be stolen and posted to instagram
[comment]Know'm sayin?

God damn I miss jroc.  And Trevor.  And Ray.

And most of all, that crazy drunk bastard Jim Lahey.

The trailer park boys is one of Canada's greatest gifts to humanity.  It's incredible.  The low definition and boom mic showing is what made it so special.
[comment]You don’t even need to support him. If you even do much as not hate him on most subs even r/pics you’ll get attacked.
[comment]Awesome meme!
[comment]Don’t forget being called brain dead.
[comment]Facts
[comment]We’ve always used a cool looking AR to shoot ground hogs and rabbits. The velocity is great but
[comment]Sometime I feel like I’m alone when I post a retort to r/politics
[comment]That sub is run by Xinny the Ping
[comment]I hate how quickly people resort to personal attacks and sweeping generalizations about his supporters. They compartmentalize all Trump supporters/conservatives into this massive, generalized group that they can demonize and dismiss and then feel justified about it. It's so asinine and counterproductive. Don't get me wrong, I don't like Trump and never have... But the way many of the liberals here have their own special flavor of hate makes so many of their taking points of acceptance and tolerance seem hollow and superficial.
[comment]\*being called a narcissist

So close.
[comment]There is a difference between politely disagreeing    and being outright disrespectful. Unfortunately, latter is far too common.
[comment]R/politics is worse than CNN and that’s saying something
[comment]r/politics is a dumpster fire.
[comment]900 people have upvoted this. Why don't we all upvote each other on r/politics. Together we can best those bots! Lol
[comment]It's basically like being in the USSR when you go there, if you voice a different opinion, crucified. If you stand up for someone else, crucified.
[comment]We always had 5.56mm. What country are you referring to?
[comment]I used to buy gold and give it to comments there. I used to get a kick out seeing a comment I agree with have gold and have -32 karma lol People scrollling must have been like wtf?

[comment]You left the mod hitting the ban hammer out.
[comment]r/politics is a joke
[comment]Imagine thinking this is real opression.
[comment]I posted on fb and got banned for a week for posting my dislike for the chinese government. It got algorithmed as “hate speech” and I got booted. I got my account back and immediately posted how you can not oppose the chinese government, but can openly threaten our president, Can’t have conservative views, or plan a peaceful protest. Caught a month ban. 

While the posts were up I got called racist and an uneducated trumper.
[comment]Very true. I said that if there is a disease going around, it is natural going to have people die from it, and I got mass downvoted. It’s crazy how deranged the liberals here on reddit are. Don’t even get me started about twitter...
[comment]My first few days on reddit I posted what I thought was a pretty middle of the road headline asking for thoughts and got shitted on for being a Nazi
[comment]I had someone comment on mine saying I needed my vote taken away because I’m white hahahaha.
[comment]Eye veal ewe.
[comment]Nice first time meme, by the way. Keep it up.
[comment]I only go on there to like the conservative comments, plus it’s funny reading how upset and wrong the liberals get.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Where was this?
[comment]In your heart you want to escape but Joe “you ain’t black” Biden pulls you back in
[comment]Love it!!
[comment]People in these cities need to wake up
[comment]I’d like to imagine the second that a liberal reads that, they’ll order the plane to be shot down for OfFeNdInG tHeM
[comment]I understand the anger and frustration over the failure of our leaders to effect change as promised.  The centers of protests that turned into chaos is in Democrat controlled cities, Democrat controlled counties and States. Biden, Schumer,  Hoyer, and Pelosi have been in Congress for over 40 yrs.  Democrats have controlled Congress for all but 4 yrs since 1932.
After 8 yrs of Obama policies and what I don't understand is how POC repeatedly vote for people that talk shit about the opposition and then dont do shit for their constituents.
[comment]It's so disappointing to see you guys look at yet another issue as us vs them. Both "sides" have valid points. Both "sides" have made mistakes. You're loyal to a political party instead of your fellow humans. Feckless, idiots. I'm so disappointed in my country. Not everything has to be a political debate(although the rich and powerful are glad you're so easily distracted). If this country ever fails don't blame "the other side", blame yourself.


Edit: thank you for the gold. We are in this together, not divided.
[comment]Truth!
[comment]“The political beliefs of our mayor directly impact our decision to be shitty violent looters!” - said nobody in this entire country
[comment]It should say "the protesters can't get us from up here"
[comment]and look at a lot of superiors in the police force. putting your officers in danger to take people’s guns to further your political view. how bout you come take em yourself. democrats can not be in charge of the police force. i don’t get it. how do the people that make their officers take guns still have jobs? it’s clearly against the constitution
[comment]A majority of the riots are happening in heavy liberal cities. I'll never understand why they blame Republicans and conservative for the racism when so many of these incidents happen in their own backyards.
[comment]Yes it's all because of two different political parties. Thank you clarifying, you've solved everything!
[comment]Hope they had an FAA permit for that... Flying with text is FAA regulated.
[comment]got a youtube link to this?
[comment]Pretty ironic considering that decades of right-leaning policy dragged us into this.
[comment]In Kansas City, we have a liberal mayor, but he has pretty conservative views in terms of law enforcement so violence has been able to be kept to a minimum
[comment]Do they charge by the letter? Why the wording so dumb?
[comment]i love it !
[comment]Got that right my state of commie Cal is about as corrupt and lawless as they come thanks to the Democrats. I live just North of Fresno Cal a few years ago the second in command at the Fresno PD was a Black man who was arrested and charged with drug running. Fresno is a major drug distribution hub for the Mexican mafia for California. The illegal alien gangs in Fresno run rampant. When I first moved here it was common to read in the Fresno newspaper about dead burnt bodies being found in farm fields at least twice a week.
[comment]I mean yes to this post but our President also decided to throw fuel on this fire and then proceed to do literally nothing.
[comment]I do wonder if Dems are facing a shalacking this year. Several special elections where they should have won they lost. Hope people are waking up.
[comment]Such a waste of money tbh
[comment]that's absoluty true and awasome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Oh, is this one of those “acceptable” forms of racism?
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/vjn3vuzg3e051.jpg[comment]Yes, it is. Because a senile white Democrat said it.
[comment]Lmao what? Did he actually say this!?
[comment]Just obey,dont think
[comment]Time for old joe to go back into the basement
[comment]Justice for Corn Pop
[comment]Just here to say that I’m a democrat and I find this to be disgusting

For real is this guy a joke?

[comment]November is fine be beautiful, a big red wave
[comment]Y'all. I'm TERRIBLE at being black. Lmao i joke about it all the time, and frankly racism doesnt bug me worth a damn.

This shit made my jaw actually drop
[comment]Joes so senile, he thinks he’s black
[comment]I wonder if Corn Pop is gonna vote for Joe Biden
[comment]An unbelievable statement in 2020. Is this really the best Democrats can offer?
[comment]To me, Biden was clearly trying to "act black." He was talking real fast and using slang and completely out of his usual slow character, and I think he was trying to prove that he's not ancient by catering to the black man he was talking to.
[comment]How the fuck did people choose Joe "segregationist" Biden over Bernie Sanders, the man who has championed civil rights for decades?

Smh.
[comment]Well he’s a democrat and he agrees with everything he is supposed to so
[comment]Still at it huh Joe? Same crap you tried with Justice Thomas. 

Punish the "uppety blacks who dare think for themselves" right?

Twatwaffle.
[comment]Republicans:no

Leftist:well no but actually yes
[comment]I mean, weren’t journalists defending his statement almost immediately afterwards and saying it’s the truth?
[comment]I haven’t been watching TV since he said this . Is anyone reporting on it on main stream media ?

He got away with saying they are gonna our y’all back in chains
[comment]I find this deeply offensive against people of color(myself included, being mixed Caucasian and Indigenous), my best friend sent this to me with the a “Hey guess what, I’m not voting democrat anymore.” Attached to this, at least some are “woke” in this regard to use a favorite term by the Left.
[comment]Tried to post an article about this on r/Democrats and it got removed in less than 5 minutes lol “already been posted” . I looked for Charlamagne, Biden, Ain’t black keywords on the sub and nothing popped up smh
[comment]Wise words from a random old man that forgot where he was, after sniffing someone's hair.
[comment]Can’t find any trace of this quote on r/Democrats, no articles no discussions
[comment]And we’re the racist ones! Lmao. Fuck the left. They are just showing their true racist colors! I love this shit! And to think people of color are making excuses for his stupid ass! Talk about plantation mentality, there it is!
[comment]Quid pro Joe is a racist POS, just like Obama.
[comment]Sleepy Quid Pro Quo Joe who doesn't know his Wife from his Sister ....doesn't know what State he is in.....thinks he's running for the Senate......sniffing hair and fingering women....letting little kids feel the hair on his legs.....you mean that Joe.......oh no......and he's the best the Dems. can come up with

He should get Maxine Waters as a running mate then he would only be 2nd dumbest
[comment]It’s (D)ifferent when we do it...
[comment]I wonder if this will be his “47%” gaffe that will cost him the election?

Just don’t look at your watch, Joe. (Showing my age)

Clarify: for the record, I voted for Romney, but it was a bit of an unfortunate slip.
[comment]hahaha I love this! It's gonna be Blackie Joe and Shamu Abrams. Good luck with that. America will not vote for that combination if you catch my drift.
[comment]I’m pretty sure that Biden could literally purchase a black person and force them to pick cotton and the African American community in America would still vote for him because Obama.
[comment]The he's racist if I'm racist game .
[comment]You’re voting for a guy whole literally held the Bible upside down and backwards. He’s satan and he’s blinded you all. It’s amazing to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Joe Rogan: 'I'd rather vote for Trump' than Biden
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-rogan-id-rather-vote-for-trump-than-biden[comment]We agree Rogan. Trump isn’t perfect but Biden would be a disaster and ultimately you would be voting for his VP to take over as president as he’s not even mentally fit now let alone in 2021 and beyond.
[comment]Joe Rogan also would rather vote for Bernie Sanders
[comment]It’s an easy decision for most of us.  I’ve always been on the fence between left and right.. I doubt I’ll ever vote again after these last 4 years. They really are some crazy mofos, really extreme. There is no disagreeing with them on any topic, and if you do, you are no longer welcome in their crew..
[comment]The Democrat party is not equipped to rule America. There are fundamental flaws in the system that they used in picking their candidate. Remember how the Iowa primary was a complete clusterfuck?
[comment]Rogan is an idiot. He knows nothing about politics and wavers every time he brings on a guest that gets him hard. Dudes just playing the game.
[comment]He might have actually grown a brain.
[comment]Joe was going to respond to this, but he forgot.
[comment]Shhhh, don’t say anything about it.
[comment]Finally, someone sensible in this crazy world.
[comment]I thought I felt an earthquake yesterday... Now I know what was it. Boom!
[comment]Hell yeah! If Biden became President we'd see at least 10 million unemployed and Thousands of deaths. Not like prepared President Trump!
[comment]either way i’m not a fan of him and have never been
[comment]Hes still stupid for thinking Bernie Sanders is a good candidate
[comment]That isn’t really saying much. Anyone with a brain can see Biden is out to lunch mentally
[comment]I think I figured out why sleepy Joe seems so off; the DNC had to scoop out part of his brains to install the remote control.
[comment]Just because somebody has a microphone in front of his face doesn't make them intelligent, nor informed. Take Donald Trump for istance
[comment]Because Joe Rogan is a disgusting person who sometimes cloaks it.
[comment]He didn’t say this.
[comment]🎶Hail to the Chief we have chosen for the nation...🎶
[comment]Nice
[comment]Why is this a big deal?
[comment]This is the same guy who said he'd vote for Bernie Sanders, lol. I dont think Joe knows much about politics.
[comment]HAHA. Honestly, he shouldn't be giving political advice, at all. Any white male who says they'd vote for Bernie, shouldn't be listened to.
[comment]Bernie Sanders is a spoiled stupid old man who's political beliefs are literally not figurative literally the closest this to nazi Germany. Socialism has never worked and it will never work. And if I do make a bunch of money I'm not paying 81 percent in taxes I've move and take my money with me
[comment]As someone who has worked in the senior living industry for years, including Memory Care units.  I really believe that Biden is showing early signs of dementia.  His brain - speech connection is failing him.  Pray for the guy as a human being, but the man cannot be president.
[comment]Every Bernie supporter would vote Trump or not at all...
[comment]He said he would vote for Whoopi Goldberg before he voted for Biden and he would vote for Hilary as well. He’s a liberal with some conservative values.<|endoftext|>

[comment]She must be smokin that peace pipe cuz thats gonna cost a lot of wampam.
[comment]Smh. Crazy woman...
[comment]Can just imagine everyone in the world flying in for surgeries. Never heard of such a ridiculous thing even in counties with socialized medicine!
[comment]We’re paying for their medical coverage regardless.  Complaining is stupid.  Come up with solutions.
[comment]Even some of my Democrat friends don’t agree with healthcare for illegals. I’d say it’s split 50/50. About half think they should have, the other half thinks they shouldn’t. Not too bad if I do say so myself, considering I live in LA
[comment]She has no interest in winning does she?
[comment]Here is how it will go down if they cover illegals

1.) Democrats believe in open borders.
2.) Instead of paying for expensive treatments themselves, Latin American governments pay for a bus ride to the US border and tell their patients to get their expensive medical treatments in the US.
3.) All thru the border state, the hospitals are jammed with illegals. Why? Because Latin America off loaded their sick and terminally ill that require expensive treatments on us.
4.) Once treated and healthy, illegals go back to their home country.
5.) The tax payers are played for a fool.
[comment]No.
[comment]What I don't get is why their own country won't cover them, and why nobody's calling their countries out on it.

[comment]I don't think any of y'all understand that if we don't start taking care of our people, the American Empire  will become a third world shithole real quick.
[comment]It’s like the UK NHS , ain’t gunna last long.
[comment]Hey you could very well be right and I respect that you have a strong opinion on this. And I am not trying to change your mind on either subject for it is clear your opinion has been formed. But here are my final thoughts for the sake of having a respectful disagreement. 

Re: border - While some far-left dems believe in open borders, it is an over-generalization to say *all* do and it is clearly not the platform of the entire party. It is only what far-right media sources claim their platform is. But it just isn’t.  And Beto lives in a border state and can have his own opinion about the border. Personally, I don’t think a wall, which has already proved to not work, is the right solution. And I think it is silly to spend billions for something people can climb or saw through. And unfortunately for Trump, more people in this country agree with this sentiment. It isn’t just the “dems” it is the majority of the American population. Just because he won doesn’t mean he can impose his will wherever he wants, he still has to convince us that he has the right solution for the problem, and a majority in this country believe this isn’t the solution. 

Re: Healthcare - The “people could take advantage of this” argument is fair, but can also be made about any policy. In almost any policy decision someone benefits and someone doesn’t. I may be naive about this particular argument, but I also don’t believe social progress shouldn’t be made just because there is a concern some people may benefit from a decision and that I may be paying for it in some way. The benefits here may outweigh the cost and that is something we should consider for a better world. We should be seeking opinions and analysis from experts to understand these costs, and instead we hear a few media personalities and mirror their opinions without forming our own. That’s all I am saying. 

You may be right in the end and I am open to that. But I am not going to rush to any decision without respectfully listening to both sides.
[comment]This is all racial politics. If the people sneaking in we're White and we're generally conservative-minded oh, it would be huge social movement stop it. But because the Democrats have made being Hispanic a political issue, because they need somebody to give them votes, all common sense is gone out the window.

<|startoftext|>[title]Hedge fund manager predicts huge market sell-off if a 'socialist' wins in 2020
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hedge-fund-manager-predicts-huge-market-sell-off-if-a-socialist-wins-in-2020[comment]First of all, it isn't going to happen, but yes, if it did, the market would completely crash. Why would the market NOT crash when prosperity destroying socialists take power?
[comment]&gt;  I gained insight into how far to the right both the Democratic and Republican parties were 

This is a quote I took form a socialist forum literally 30 seconds ago. God forbid you voice your opinion here too you'll be called a racist alt-right whatever. These people are crazy. If they love socialism overseas so much, why the hell wouldn't they move there? 

 My take on this is *if* a socialist were to win, people would sell anything they had **quickly** and move money offshore as fast as they could to keep what they worked hard for and not to give it to the government (I'm sure it's more technical than this but I wouldn't doubt it not happening). The market will drop several thousand points and unemployment will be at an all time high. Either way, I believe another recession is coming and if socialism wins, we will stay in a recession for many years to come. Just my prediction.
[comment]So just buy up the fallen stocks and make bank.
[comment]Socialists≠Economics
[comment]I’m assuming those would equate to “limited” government involvement in the economy
[comment]Trump will won in 2020 but we will probably get a Democrat in 2024. At that point it will be time to pull your money out of the stock market. I plan to pull mine at ~6 months before the election and wait until we go into a recession, then buy back in.
[comment]Ya bud. Let me know when anyone who’s under 50 right now sees their social security money. Because it’s never going to happen.
[comment]This happens EVERY. SINGLE. ELECTION. This is not news or even remotely true. There will be no "sell off" this is scare tactics by the rich which should surprise no one.

[comment]Don’t call it a gun buyback. I didn’t buy my firearms from the government. I bought them from FFLs and private party. The government isn’t paying me for my guns. They’re raising my taxes, taking my money, and using my money to buy my guns for substantially less than I paid for them. NO THANKS.

[comment]His original last name was “Bet”, but he wanted to be more Spanish.
[comment]First, cops(state, county, and city) are not federal employees. They have an oath to uphold the constitution but not one to obey the president.

Second, a vast majority of police, like my city and county police, support the second amendment. They privately own multiple firearms. Just look at the clothing choices and tattoos to get an insight.

Grunt style, Ranger up, and 5.11 being popular choices. American flag tats along with ar-15s and military style artwork.

Last, even if he were to send in the National Guard, a good portion would join our side and deplete their numbers.

When I went through the academy in 2016, one guy said he was voting for Hilary. The other 32 recruits were against her on principle alone. Even my former department all voted for Trump. And even though I'm no longer working there, I keep in close contact. They all support the second amendment rights of every citizen. Anecdotal, sure. But this is my experience.

[comment]Beto's got my vote for 2024.  Dems are coming for our guns eventually, and the worst case scenario for us is if they do it gradually.  Best case is if they make it clear that its 'put up or shut up' time.
[comment]Because that will most definitely, almost certainly, 100% satisfaction guaranteed, stop mass shootings in the United States. 
Yeah okay, sure. Ignore the fact that there's a black market, ignore the fact that other, possibly worse, massacres could happen. Believe the faulty mindset that banning guns will stop mass shootings. Believe that logic from the Purge movies where after 24 hours of illegal acts becoming legal, everything magically goes back to normal.
[comment]I'm so glad we didn't elect this jackass last year

Even /r/Texas which is uber liberal has abandoned him as a lunatic loser.

[comment]This commie is just the worst.
[comment]Why do people even buy this crap? Politicians do this nonsense all the time before they’re elected. They lie.

So, if you know anything about the law, you know that disarming Americans is a lot more nuanced than simply sending cops to get guns. It’s never going to happen. He is just trying to appeal to mega liberals.

No.
[comment]Can we just let these people hold a microphone and keep them talking?
[comment]No way beto is this stupid, I'm betting he knows he could never take away people's guns but is just saying it to win over the emotional voters. In short, he says this shit because he thinks it makes him popular.
[comment]No, you won't. None will survive such an attempt soy boy.
[comment]Beto is just digging hard into this narrative and I will be quite surprised if he ever holds office again in Texas. I think we should all take this as a blessing as it also looks bad for the rest of the Democratic party.

Beto's plan would literally result in civil bloodshed.

[comment]To all the police and people saying that they wouldn’t help with the enforcement of the law, remember that when Hitler rose to power he gathered around him an army to do his policing for him. By the time he was second in charge he had 4 million brownshirts (storm troopers) compared to germany’s army and police only having 50,000. Most takeovers are dependent on a para military that has the real power and a weak police and state army.

[comment]It’s not legal for a government funded agency. However, here we are....
[comment]This is such bullshit
[comment]I’m surprised trump hasn’t put an end to money towards PP, NPR, etc
[comment]this isn't new--they've been spending money on politics and elections for years. They do it through their Super Pac. it's legal because they do it through the super pac and other 501c4 entities
[comment]It's legal because there are distinct, separate entities involved. The political committees do not receive money from governments but only donations from the public which are not tax deductible. That's the money those entities spend on political stuff. The money that other entities get from government only goes to allowable stuff, like dispensing healthcare, none of which involves abortions. Plenty of other organizations have similar structures where you can make tax deductible deductions to one part of the organization or non-deductible donations to their political arms.
[comment]Isn't this kind of argument a logical fallacy? This would be the same if the Feds gave money to a teacher's unions or a nonprofit that helps to feed the hungry and they then use donations they get (not the money the feds give them) to help fund elections to support candidates that would help support them to get even more funding for teachers or food banks?   


Also, people seem to forget that they also do family planning and std testing.
[comment]We did it...its simple. Citizens United made A merica political donation crack heads...
[comment]What’s twitchy?
[comment]Wait that sounds like Corp money in politics.
[comment]Better than spending it on killing babies.
[comment]That’s called lobbying, sir
[comment]Convincing your political party to off their kids sounds like a great way to get rid of your political party.
[comment]1. What's the difference between a non-profit organization like Planned Parenthood providing financial and other forms of endorsements into politics and a church/religious organization that will lose their non-profit status if they state the name of their preferred candidate from the pulpit? 
2. Any organization, regardless of political affiliation should be immediately disqualified from any and all possibility of government funding if any of their money goes to a political organization. This should be a given, but government funds can't be used to financially support one political party over another.
[comment]OP I completely agree with you but you were asking for the resistance by putting the name of the Abortion Factory in the title. The place Democrats created to keep poor black communities from expanding (it’s true, look it up). Libs love them some aborted babies.  

Anyhow, the lib trolls already browse this sub even though they hate everything R’s stand for, including country and the nuclear family. They browse knowing there’s nothing here they’d ever agree with so their whole plan is to downvote and show off their TDS side effects.  What a miserable thing to do.  

Go back to r/chapotraphouse , r/politics , r/Democrats or whatever echo chamber you crawled out of.
[comment]If they can donate to a political party they don't need government help.
[comment]It shouldn’t be legal, but they use a separate entity. If you want to make it illegal get rid of Citizens United.
[comment]Planned parenthood should be defunded and everyone there should be thrown out to live on the streets. 

Abortion is wrong. And benefiting financially from abortion is even worse. Using that money to influence the political outcome of an election is just sickening. Burn it all down.
[comment]If i ever ran for office as a Republican I would spend all my time talking about abortion while waving a gun on stage and I would probably get elected.
[comment]I’m asking this because I genuinely don’t know. Isn’t this basically what the NRA does? Both organizations have a separate entity that operates from private donations that they use for political purposes, right?
[comment]It's about to get even more legal if Trump and the GOP get rid of the Johnson Amendment which keeps 501c3 organizations from directly or indirectly intervening amd participating in in any political campaign.

[comment]In the interests of debate, copypasta'd from Snopes (if you believe in it or not, notwithstanding) and other sites:

#  What's True

The Trump administration's proposed 2021 budget includes cuts to the CDC's activities related to chronic disease. (ED: This is not set in stone, however, and will likely change on updated information)

 It is also true that in 2018 the Trump administration fired key officials connected to the U.S. pandemic response, and they were not replaced.  (ED: YMMV on to what extent this impacts a response; I would hazard that it would, but I cannot say to what extent)

# What's False

Congress hasn't approved the budget, so CDC funding in 2021 remains unclear. (ED: So, no the Administration has not cut funding, nor has Congress)

# Regarding the disease

From [www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/how-does-coronavirus-compare-with-previous-global](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/how-does-coronavirus-compare-with-previous-global)

&gt; World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Tarik Jašarević recently [estimated](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic) the COVID-19’s R naught (the number of other people one sick person is likely to infect on average) is around 2–2.5, whereas at least one study has suggested it could be as high as [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). Based on the number of confirmed deaths and cases, it has a case fatality rate (CFR) of around 2.65%. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is thought to have [originated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738798) in a Chinese ‘wet market’. Although more deadly than COVID-19 – it has a [CFR of 14–15%](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) – most cases of human-to-human transmission [occurred in healthcare settings](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) and it only made its way to 26 different countries before being contained.  
   
Its [estimated R naught](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf) during the initial phase of the epidemic was 2.9, but the implementation of control measures reduced it to 0.4 in the final months of the outbreak. 

From  [https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html) 

&gt; The annual flu typically has a mortality rate of around 0.1% in the U.S. So far, there's a 0.05% mortality rate among those who caught the flu virus in the U.S. this year, according to the CDC. 

So as a summation, COVID's considerably not as dangerous as SARS (about 1/4th as dangerous, fatality-wise), and less infectious (by about 10% less), but substantially more dangerous than the common flu (at least in the US and presumably in most other 1st world countries).<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/ff110fx7vkv41.png[comment]I mean, its not cool either way unless she is just lying and trying to exploit a mere coincidence (which I highly doubt)
[comment]As a democrat, im still in the #believeher crowd. This whole "blue no matter who" campaign is total horseshit.
[comment]He DID hear that she liked him, maybe that's it
[comment]I don’t know if I believe her. 

There’s been some anecdotal evidence so far: the Larry King call, her neighbor/friend saying she told her about it back in the 90s. Why not come forward sooner though? A perpetual cry of the critics of accusers. 

With the current evidence it’s 50/50 she’s lying or she’s not. But that’s not what’s bugging me 

What’s bugging me is the absolute void of media coverage. The most significant coverage we’ve gotten was Google Play store removing the episode of Larry King with the call. I read the Times, Journal, and Post daily, and I haven’t seen any front page stories about the accusation. I haven’t gotten any news bulletins about the accusation from anyone except fox. 

I’m not saying they have to believe her! But the fact they’re not covering it at all, when you damn well they would and have given other accusers against Republicans *constant* coverage, is telling.

[comment]Exactly.
[comment]I am a Democrat and I believe Tara Reade
[comment]The problem here is not so much the acussation, but the sheer amount of other evidence that gives tremendous credibility to the accusation.  Those hundreds of videos where Joe is acting creepy with women of all ages definitely do not help his case. In contrast judge Kavanough have ha clean an respectable record void of inappropriate/ creepy stuff.
[comment]This pretty much proves the case that the “American divide”  is manufactured by the media in order to boost rage, which in turn boost network ratings for fake news channels and print.  Resulting in advertising revenue.  There is a financial incentive to sow anger.

<|startoftext|>[title]Study: 96% of Biologists Agree Life Begins at Fertilization
[selftext]https://politifeed.net/news/study-96-of-biologists-agree-life-begins-at-fertilization[comment]Yes it does
[comment]REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[comment]Life begins before fertilization. Both the egg and the sperm are living.

Are they sentient beings? No.
[comment]20 years ago, 100% of people agreed as well. This is a generational thing. People are more ignorant today than ever.
[comment]The sad thing is that most know it’s starts at fertilization, but still support abortion...
[comment]WOW 96% of scientists agree that climate change...oops...I mean...life begins at conception.
[comment]Here's the actual study.  Chapter 5 is the relevant section.  The questions asked start on page 240.  It's an interesting read.
https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/1883

What the headline alludes to is that 96% of respondents agreed with one or more of the following statements:

1. Implicit Statement: “The end product of mammalian fertilization is a fertilized egg (‘zygote’), a new mammalian organism in the first stage of its species’ life cycle with its species’ genome.”
2. Implicit Statement: “The development of a mammal begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.”
3. Implicit Statement: “A mammal's life begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete unites with a female gamete to form a single cell called a zygote.”
4. Explicit Statement: “In developmental biology, fertilization marks the beginning of a human's life since that process produces an organism with a human genome that has begun to develop in the first stage of the human life cycle.”
5. Explicit Statement: “From a biological perspective, a zygote that has a human genome is a human because it is a human organism developing in the earliest stage of the human life cycle.”

Statement 5 was the most contentious of these statements.  It was affirmed by 69% of respondents, and rejected by 31%.

85% of the respondents were pro-choice, and 15% pro-life.
[comment]Here is the thing, the Abortionists dont listen to sicence, they only listen to politcians that support their beliefs.
[comment]Keep your evangelical bs out of government it's the same shit as sharia law
[comment]So with your logic the day after pill is murder?  That’s an asinine statement.  Besides scientists all agree that life came from the Big Bang so does this mean we quote science only when it fits our narrative?
[comment]I am not a republican or even a conservative in the slightest, but I agree that abortion should be illegal and is immoral, as the fetus cannot consent. This issue should not be as partisan as it is.
[comment]When does life without the boot heel of a government agent begin?
[comment]I’m from the UK and just recently Northern Ireland have passed a law that makes it legal to have an abortion up to 28 weeks. That basically means that a baby that is touching 7 months old can now be legally aborted. I think that’s awful but there’s nothing you can do. You just have to accept it at this point because the progressives always get their way. I can understand the reasoning for abortion when the baby is in its very early stages but when it’s touching 7 months old I don’t see how you can justify it unless the baby or mother’s health is seriously compromised.
[comment]I'm ok, not being ok with killing babies of any species.
[comment]Abortion is simply a selfish act in almost every case,  I’ve heard women say if they had a baby that they couldn’t afford X, Y, and Z. Well you shouldn’t have taken the risk of having sex and not willing to have a child, my mother is in her fifties and just had another child that wasn’t planned on, we love him and we never considered an abortion because even if we aren’t in the safest place financially my family is ready to take on another child to give them the best in life.

An argument I see is that it isn’t the fathers choice because he doesn’t carry it for 9 months.  That’s BS, the father and the mother working together is the only way a child is born so leaving everything up to the mother after they have sex is just the most horse shit excuse I’ve seen, women have gotten abortions without telling there husbands because they just don’t want to take care of it.  

What if the father was okay with having another child? It’s his kid as well, is it not?  There are plenty of single fathers out there that took the child because the mother wasn’t willing to stay and care for it.
[comment]99% of biologists agree there ARE ONLY 2 FLAMING GENDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
[comment]People no longer give a shit because its not convenient. I remember having an argument with a dude who tried to make it an autonomy argument, but he completely missed the point that parents have a duty of care.
[comment]Here’s the big one I can’t understand:

Scientists are now doing the In Vitro Fertilization with genetic screening of embryos to choose the gender or likeliness to have blue eyes, etc. And they talk how much they care about the embryo and how magical all of this is. 

Then just as ready to kill that amazing thing at 9 months. 

Scientists see the beginning of life amazing and see all the DNA code and unique information in each one. Work so hard to make life happen and then work so hard to make sure they can kill them just as easy.
[comment]x% of scientist say what the left wants about climate change, then it's "settled science."  &gt;x% of scientists say life begins at fertilization and the left grows another head and shouts everybody down.  

Just goes to prove one thing.  The left doesn't know anything about or care anything about actual science.  Don't ever let them tell you otherwise.

[comment]God bless I thought her eyes were going to fall out with all the rolling they were doing
[comment]Perfect! Except I want to see those titties
[comment]Not me! I spent the whole time with my phone focused on her face taking pictures of all of the stank-tuary expressions she was making. The Memes will make them selves!
[comment]Epic!! Trump completely owned Nancy. I believe I heard him rip a nasty fart in her direction—nasty Nancy probably loved the taste of Digested McDonald’s
[comment]Much like an ostrich.
[comment]Your dad is smart, haha. Seeing her can ruin anyone's appetite
[comment]What? Her reactions made it super entertaining!
[comment]Her ripping those documents at the end was so childish, whether your republican or democrat, that was just unprofessional, course all the news networks either wont bring it up or they'll make it out like she was some sort of martyr 🙄
[comment]I wish I thought of that.
[comment]I watched it online so I could browse worthwhile endeavors all over her face.
[comment]I was hoping she would get a massive papercut when she ripped up his speech. She is a nasty woman.

[comment]You guys live in a sad, alternate reality where facts mean nothing and feelings are everything. Vote Democrat. Fuck repubs
[comment]She behaved like her usual self.  Can't be happy for the American people because of her hatred of Trump.  Ripping up the speech was icing on the cake.
[comment]I cant believe she tore them up what a fool
[comment]Why couldnt I have thought of this?! This would have saved me so much aggrevation!

[comment]The Democrats couldnt have looked more against the American people then last night. Not clapping/celebrating for the successes Americans are experiencing just because a democrat isn't president blows my mind
[comment]I for one am so glad she ripped up the speech at the end. Many people watching that will instinctively know it demonstrates unbridled hatred, and they won't want any part of it.

The country needs to know that while his administration is trying to save lives, and they were in a bipartisan way toward a common cause, Pelosi and Schumer are playing politics out of spite and refusal to do anything that would appear as a win for the Trump administration.

[comment]Man, this just shows me how problematic our political are right now.  Even in a crisis they can't work together.

In case anyone was wondering this is what the Democrats were against in the bill.

"Democrats say the language would allow for corporations to keep bailout money while still firing workers, that the bailout money would have virtually no restraints and that there are very weak stock buyback restrictions."

"A senior Democratic aide told NBC News that Democrats are concerned that the bill lacks specific provisions to protect people from evictions, foreclosure or forbearance and that it would allow for only three months of unemployment insurance."
[comment]The Democratic Party has hit rock bottom. In years past, while Dems and Republicans had their differences, they were able to work together and put politics aside on major issues for the American people.

Pelosi and Schumer are easily the worst leaders the Dems have ever had in DC.

[comment]This just proves what alot of folks have been saying....the Dems don't care whether or not the country fails.  They just want rid of Trump.  There is no "dealing" with a group like this.  Failure plays into their hands and they can get a "socialist utopia" they dream of.
[comment]How are you so sure that the corporations who employ Americans will spend the money in our best interest? There is a clear argument against this bill saying that corporations can still still lay off employees while taking bailout money. It’s being called a slush fund because they are loose rules on how it’s spent. I’m wary of that sort of thing, aren’t you?

[comment]I paid my way thru school. It took longer, but I got it done. I know exactly how this dad feels.
[comment]My moderately liberal friends who've already completed their degrees even agree with this father.
[comment]A principle the Dems want to propagate is the devolution of morals and standards...like paying your own way. The dad is shocked, but why? This is the Dem plan for everything.
[comment]How do people defend this, whats the argument?
[comment]Its always funny to see the ones who complain about paying back their student loans.  

Them:  "I've got a PHD from the Ivy League and I can only find this job as a barista I'm drowning in $300k in student loans."

Me:  "Oh, that is terrible I'm so sorry to hear that!  What was your thesis on?"

Them:  "The inerpretation of 16th century lesbian poetry's impact on the modern patriarchy"

Me:  "You know what, when I said I'm sorry to hear that... I take it back."

Them:  "FASCSTI ASSHOLE!!!"

Me:  "You know, for going to an Ivy League school one would think you were smart enough to understand that you actually have to have a job that can pay off the money you borrowed to get that degree.  I mean I just went to 2 years of community college and then 3 at the university and I'm making 6 figures... Can I have my coffee now?"
[comment]They’re always talking about forgiving the loans... if student loans are so horrible, why keep issuing them? Shouldn’t that be step one?
[comment]I love this song
[comment]I’m a little mixed on this. I am pro accountability, but I do think schools have unfairly targeted targeted kids and sold bs degrees (lib art degrees with no ROI). I really wish institutions were held more accountable and not taxpayers
[comment]She really is a complete moron. Can’t believe people take her or any of those wackjob candidates seriously
[comment]Great, now do Bernie. These plans are stupid.
[comment]Is this like a Joe the Plumber situation, where "Iowa Dad" is actually a political operative? Because I can promise you there are very few people out there who are stupid/selfish enough to actually think their high tuition bills were acceptable and if they had to deal with them, fuck everyone else.
[comment]I do get this dad. We saved and saved, while our two kids were young, putting monthly amounts into a 529 savings plan.  They worked their butts off in HS, getting those grades for academic scholarships, and good ACT/SAT scores, worked PT jobs, and went to state colleges. They both also worked PT jobs on campus and then their summer jobs. They both graduated with no debt. Both have great jobs and our older son, 26, just bought his first home. With all of this, what horrifies me is the increasing cost of tuition. It seems to be artificially inflated because these colleges and universities know they can get piles of cash from students going to school on loans. I have a hard time believing the cost of educating a student for one semester can possibly be 10K-20K, (not including room and board).
[comment]Warren makes more Republicans everyday...
[comment]In her defense, leftists screw everyone over, then tell you how much they are helping you.  They just need a little more to make the previous screwing better.
[comment]That’s exactly what my wife’s parents — both blue collar workers — did for her. Her one sister went military so they had the money they’d saved for both her and my wife ready to go for when she got to school. She went to a smaller, local college that wasn’t an arm and a leg and it was basically all paid for. My wife even worked to supplement the stuff they wouldn’t pay for (food, rent, etc.). Her parents had saved enough for all but about $10,000 of her education and they paid off her student loans for that, just as they’d promised.
[comment]Such a selfish take. So things can never get better for the next generation, because of what the previous generation went though?
[comment]It's not only that.  If the government comes in and makes college free it's going to make it less relevant.  Those who went to school and worked hard to earn a degree in something relevant are going to be flooded out by a bunch of people studying worthless majors. They are only there because its free and it's the next step.  It will just become high school 2.0.  If I had to guess it would also lower in quality/standards and thus people coming out would be less prepared for the real world.

[comment]US Constitution, Article 1, section 7:

&gt; All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives

Warren:

&gt; Warren has said she would pay for the plan, estimated to cost $640 billion, with a 2 percent "wealth tax" on individuals earning greater than $50 million.

&gt; She even said she'd do so on her first day in the White House, and **bypass Congress if necessary.** (emp mine)

&gt; she would act **without waiting for Congress** because the Secretary of Education can “use its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs.” (emp mine)

Am I in a weird timeline where we are currently watching the Senate snore through an impeachment process of a quite flimsy interpretation of what the president can or cannot do with foreign policy while a presidential candidate (who is currently sitting in judgement of her political rival) campaigns on violating the constitution "day 1"?

As an aside, I cannot understand why republicans are not hitting back on the dem line that Trump was working to get a foreign government to interfere with the statement that impeachment is a tool to a, interfere through propaganda, and b, to allow Trump's political rivals an opportunity to vote him off the ballot and not have to face him in November.
[comment]"This was difficult for me and it should be difficult for everyone else too."
[comment]I'm guessing everyone here is upper middle class if not in the top 10 or 15 percent, you can all afford to go to college without incurring 100s of thousands of dollars of debt.

[comment]Honestly, he got a few brownie points from me for finally mentioning how Bernie’s somehow a commie but loaded with $ 1 million and has three houses.
[comment]I have a good feeling he’s still going to be the nominee if they can pull off the rigging of it. They see things via identity politics. Fuck his policies he’s a billionaire and that’s the only important thing cause trumps a billionaire too.

It’s like trying to fight a toddler that just learned how to speak in sentences
[comment]Warren should’ve paid for info on the NDAs connected to men he previously employed.
[comment]I fuck with this, yeah
[comment]Initially I was pretty jazzed for a moderate democrat. After last night ... not so much.
[comment]I just want to listen to Hulu while I sleep without waking up at 1am after hearing a loudass *mike finds a way*
[comment]Tell that to the 15% of Dems who have supported him until now
[comment]I think bloomberg is the best thing on that shit show of a stage.
[comment]I like him because he’s pissing off the liberals.
[comment]And as an innocent person just trying to watch youtube in peace
[comment]Aww shucks, thanks r/Republicans 
It's nice to see some unifying content 🤝
[comment]I did like seeing Amy going after Pete. It almost was like watching Ralphie kick Scott Farkus' ass
[comment]How about hating Bernie?
[comment]Bloomberg is everything the media said trump would be in 2016
[comment]I want him to win the nomination. So many Democrats will stay home.
[comment]Governor Northam has been working out.
[comment]Why are the liberals black and conservatives white in the meme? Kind of pushes a phony stereotype amd identity politics.
[comment]I think Bloomberg is ok, because he had the balls to call Bernie a communist and made him be open about who he is. I really hate his gun policy though.
[comment]Oh so the liberals have to be black and the conservatives have to be white?  


^(WhAt aRe YoU sOMe KiNd oF raCiSt BiGoT?)
[comment]I disagree. We aren't the party of hate. 

Democrats on the other hand...
[comment]Eh I hate practically all of left candidates but Bloomberg is the least communist and most practical who understand economics
[comment]Idk why you should HATE the guy , in fact I think it’s pretty clear he is the best out of the Democratic Party right now
[comment]I dislike Bernie Panders more than Bloomberg. I thought the others made Bloomberg look almost classy tbh.
[comment]At least bloomberg and biden bring some sanity back to the left...to some degree.
[comment]Hi I’m a Democrat who likes to browse sorry for commenting I know that’s against the rules. I usually have pretty negative reactions to stuff in this sub, as I’m sure y’all do in left leaning subs, but I love this. Fuck that dude. Glad we can cross the aisle on something lmao
[comment]As a leftist, very happy to see this :)
[comment]At least he isn’t as bad as Bernie
[comment]I don’t keep up with politics. What’s the deal with this fella?
[comment]i’m a liberal and can confirm this is true
[comment]I have more respect for republicans than half the hacks in my own party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]I was a Democrat and Bernie supporter
[selftext]And while I ethically agree with the idea of saving lives from off of the streets through providing healthcare for everybody, and with college tuition being massively lowered, I realized that this is all deeper than red vs blue, and a Republic is what our country needs, and Trump’s cabinet is far and away the greatest team to lead this Republic to our greatness. I used to think “make America great again” was a derogatory and hateful phrase: that’s how bad they get you. Speaking as a freshly converted democrat-to-republican, I ask to give some time for other Democrats to discover the corruption occurring. For many democrats at the ground level are necessary, as progress and tradition both have their place, but they don’t know yet that they are being straight up lied to.[comment]Just need to open their eyes and their minds instead of blindly following the party line. If they can critically think and research various issues it really isn’t a hard choice
[comment]The worry isn't that they come around the worry is that it'll be too late
[comment]I always am interested in hearing the detailed story of how people change in this regard; can you tell us the story? I would like to hear it.

Edit: Tell us your demographic as well, it does matter.
[comment]Welcome to the fiscally sound *dark side.*
[comment]Welcome.
[comment]How is the best way to talk to a Democrat about this? I want to talk in a way that is easiest to understand.
[comment]I was in the same boat.
[comment]That’s one more added to the good side....only 200 million more to go!   Welcome, my friend.
[comment]Welcome!!! ❤️❤️❤️
[comment]Wait till you realize a large majority don’t give a flying fuck as long as they get “theirs” so to speak.
[comment]Welcome to the "dark" side. We have less taxes, less monopolies, and policies that actually work. How evil!
[comment]Welcome home.
[comment]Welcome, welcome to the fuckin show.

You’ll be called racist, xenophobic, bitter, careless, and ignorant, but it means nothing. We have our faults and ambitions but our side tries our absolute best to argue with facts in lieu of virtue signaling.

I feel many others like you are out there quietly waiting until November to make their voice be heard.
[comment]Welcome!
[comment]Welcome !
[comment]You guys sure this is the type of person. You want to be associated with? LOL
[comment]Welcome. But be forewarned: we’re only allowed to vote once per election.
[comment]Bernie is a prime example of the machine leading the gullible.

How many years has he spent in office and what to show for it?
The dude was chairman of the VA during some of its worst years for veterans care.

I'm not saying it's his fault, but that he was totally inept and incompetent when it came time to actually do stuff. He's a reactive politician, not a proactive one. Hindsight is 2020, quite literally this time.
[comment]&gt;a Republic is what our country needs

What do you mean? Congrats on converting, btw
[comment]I want to give you and anyone who has done this team change major props. It’s not easy seeing light from propaganda and brainwashing. I was a socialist as a kid before I knew what politics were. I just wanted everyone to have fair trade. I didn’t want people to suffer. Unfortunately it’s a lot more complicated than that. Most of my friends are super lefties out in Cali. God Bless you all and good luck voting!
[comment]Welcome we are glad to have you
[comment]Welcome! I walked away in 2004. Kerry? Were they joking? Nope!
[comment]Same. I used to be a full on democratic supporter, blinded by their "political correctness" they push using young liberals. Then I realized that there were so many loopholes in that ideal utopian thought of political correctness. Then i started to really look up to their policies or promises they have made, and what they are doing now. And i really need to say the whole pc thing is just blinding people, especially people around my age.
[comment]I was also a Bernie supporter back in 2016. Like OP stated I too like the idea of lowering the expense to obtain a college degree, improving our healthcare system etc. but a real solution isn’t as simple as “taxing the billionaires”. I wasn’t sure if I was a Democrat or a Republican back then, but what I’ve observed from the DNC and how the last 4 years have unfolded I know for certain I cannot align myself with the Democratic Party. The party leadership is not rational and they continually lie about everything. Glad you were able to observe what’s happening and most of all I’m glad you’re able to think for yourself, OP
[comment]I don't agree with "government paid" healthcare for all.  What I would support is a healthcare savings plan in which you can voluntarily set aside a percentage of income tax free in an HSA.  The money rolls over year after year.  It is spent on healthcare costs only again tax free.  Upon your death, money goes to designated next of kin and is taxed as income.  No need for general medical insurance, just catastrophic.
[comment]Welcome to the team! I’m from north jersey too!
[comment]I highly recommend reading up on conservatism and what that means. Look up Freidrich Hayek, William F. Buckley, and George Will. I’m not trying to gate keep, but I think it’s important for people to understand what a group believes in before they join it. Based on your comments, you seem to be switching sides based on some conspiracy theories and “corruption,” not actually political philosophy. To me, this seem analogous to someone switching from Judaism to Christianity because they found out “the Jews killed Jesus,” but they don’t know anything else about Christianity.
[comment]I do hope you realize that things are far from perfect on this side as well. There is corruption on both sides, but conservatives stand for independence, freedom and all People. 
Welcome, we are glad you are here.
[comment]Lmao you were a bernie supporter who identified as a democrat? most bernie supporters i know can’t stand the Democratic party
[comment]There's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. As far as college tuition. The answer isn't to lay the burden on tax otters to pay off other peoples school loans. The answer is to force colleges to charge fair tuition and lower it substantially.  One way to do it is for the government to limit the amount they lend for school loans. Cap it at $12k/year. Colleges will have to adjust or have empty classes. 
As far as Healthcare for all. It never works. We had a better system before Obamacare.  Everybody that worked had decent insurance through their employer. Though that didn't could go to various county hospitals that didn't charge. I live near Chicago. We have Cook County hospital. They provide service to anybody, no charge. Tax payers cover it. You cant raise taxes on the middle class to 80% to cover all the costs for lazy government leeches. Thats what Bernie would have done.
[comment]I am all for people getting healthcare and being able to afford college. But nothing in this world is free. If you want it for free, someone else has to go to work to pay for it. No amount of playing the victim can change that. Everyone has to work for their needs to be met.
[comment]You like single payer? You like college free for all? We have room for you in the Republican Party. If you want activist government, no problem. Do it at the state level. But for the hardcore Left call Republicans racist for talking about Federalism.
[comment]I smell lies.

\*My mistake... that smell was just pizzagate.  Nothing to see here.
[comment]Welcome Patriot. Glad to see you are awake.
God bless.

[comment]Losers who will always be losers, there only hope is free stuff from the government
[comment]They're being taught to hate America, this has to stop or it will destroy the country
[comment]so sent the 92% to china. theyll be happy there
[comment]That number isn't much higher than the percentage of Democrats that are actually Americans.  


Thank you.

I'll be here all week.
[comment]So send them to Venezuela or Hong Kong. It's what they want. They can see first hand how it really is.
[comment]What else do you expect when you've been told how horrible the US is from your parents, elementary teachers, Middle-school teachers, High-school teachers, professors, and peers your whole life?

You don't develop critical thinking skills when you're punished for thinking differently.
[comment]I wonder if thus is why the Dem party is loosing people and the independent parties are picking up numbers
[comment]That is just sad. I can't even come up with anything more.
[comment]I dislike articles that misrepresent polls like this.

&gt;The poll asked 1,000 college students: How proud are you to be an American: very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud, or not at all proud?


&gt;Among the middle, 24 percent of Republican college students, 58 percent of independents, and 69 percent of Democratic college students said they are either moderately or only a little proud to be an American.

• Indiana University: Seems kinda silly to be proud about something I had zero control over.

• University of Houston: I’m glad to be an American, but I’m definitely not proud.

• Cal State San Marcos: America is the only country that matters.

• Notre Dame: Grateful? Yes. I don’t think pride is the correct emotion.

Much different than “republicans love America, democrats hate America” as the title implies.
[comment]They should leave then.
[comment]Biased domain haha. That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. Breitbart is trash. This is an absurd article that probably wasn't even based off a real poll.
[comment]Well looking at our current president not surprised.  The negative stereotype on Americans is being dumb and lazy.  Well at least the former can be declared true.
[comment]I’m ashamed they’re Americans too.
[comment]I am a Republican and i am proud to be an American

That 8% Bunch of ingrates
[comment]I thought we actually cared about facts instead of just looking at a clickbait article title
[comment]College is where they teach America is bad. Orange Man bad. Bad bad whites and socialism is paradise on earth.
[comment]I'm the son of immigrant parents and I love being american. I have visited both of my parents home countries (I'm asian) and would not trade places to live in either one. Even some of our crappiest universities are top 100 in the world (my school). That's a thing people never talk about. How unusual is it that the US has so many nationally renowned universities when most countries have only one or two. We lead in scientific discoveries and innovation.  Any industry you wish to work in it's hard to argue that the US is not a prime place to find a job for that industry. Some of the crappiest houses I've seen in the US is league's better than the crumbling unsafe houses I've seen visiting other countries. My dad worked his ass off and succeeded in the land of opportunity and is able to support all his relatives and my mothers back in their home countries. You are rewarded in the US for the amount of hard work you put in and I cannot say the same for other countries.
[comment]I'm shocked 25% of Republicans are not proud to be Americans
[comment]Why i'm not proud to be American: Lives in Australia
[comment]They were proud almost 3yrs and then they learned how democracy really worked.
[comment]They're traitors to their country
[comment]I have been to many countries in the last 20 years.

I always talk withfolks in bars and restaurants and in conferences and I can tell you that the opinions of foreigners have dramatically changed in the last few years.

The overwhelming majority of people I have talked to said two things about electing trump:

1. Have you all lost your minds? This was almost *every person I spoke with* when they realized I was American.

2. He isgoing to try to become a dictator and we *know* dictators. This was said in many different waysbutitall boiled down to the same set of words.

So no, right now, I am NOT proud to be an American. This situation makes me angry. And it should make EVERYONE angry. Our country was founded on the idea that monarchy is an invalid government structure and that demagogues have no place in leadership. 

We have a man in the white house who thinks he should be king. We have the world telling us we are out of our minds. 

How can anyone be "proud" of that???
[comment]Only 75%? Darn it’s lower than I thought. I need to speak to the soldiers.<|endoftext|>

This virus is circulating in our community. And while we know of 110 positive test results, we also know there are likely many more that have gone untested. Because of that, we really urge everyone to act as those the virus could be anywhere and take the appropriate precautions – staying home except for essential trips, keeping 6 feet from others when in public, washing hands, not touching your face with unwashed hands, disinfecting high-touch surface and objects, etc.
[comment]Yeah but the media is pumping out fake news and lies against him just about everyday. The Lib media is absolutely disgusting they are doing the same as the Nazis did to the German people in WWII, nothing but propaganda.
[comment]Lol, I thought the title said Doctor. I was like, yeah no shit. Otherwise he would be President Doctor Trump. 

He is far from a dictator as well. Him fighting for strong states rights throughout this ordeal proves it tenfold.
[comment]Correct.  It shows he is incompetent
[comment]This is the same man that wanted to open businesses and risk people’s lives so his businesses could start making money again and  now you’re applauding him? Really? Cmon

Or... are you taking about when he referred to the virus as a hoax?
[comment]Congrats? He may not be a dictator but he's stupid. He tried to open the country back up by Easter and immediately every single scientist in the entire country was like wait....NO. How can he be so out of touch?
[comment]Why would he be a dictator?
[comment]This whole sub is a cult.
[comment]Genuinely curious, will the GOP support giving pregnant women $2,400 instead of $1,200?

[comment]This is really disturbing.  Schiff has now resorted to violating 4th Amendment rights of his political opposition.  These records are referenced in the report but weren't obtained by a lawful subpoena.  And now you've got Democrats threatening a Republican Congressman to "lawyer up."

Democrats are not principled opposition, folks.  They are vile, evil people that have organized themselves into a political mafia.  They actively seek to hurt and destroy anyone who disagrees with their agenda, and unless a silent majority in the party manages to rise up and squash these worms occupying the party leadership positions, they are beyond redemption.

[comment]Schiff4brains needs to be introduced to a Louisville slugger
[comment]This is crazy.  I mean if anyone associated with President Trump or his administration had been investigated or indicted for wrongdoing, or let alone convicted of crime, then maybe there's be a good reason to look into all this seemingly normal activity by the President's personal lawyer in a foreign country.

But obviously Rudy is not being investigated by the FBI, it's perfectly normal for the President's personal lawyer to go to foreign countries and engage in serious negotiations about weapons and money, Rudy is not being investigated by his former department, and Roger Stone and Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos have been acquitted of all charges.

Oh and the Republican Senate did not, I repeat did not conclude after a thorough investigation that Russia (not Ukraine) ran a military intelligence operation to sway our election toward President Trump.

So what's all this fuss?
[comment]This is hardcore gaslighting.
[comment]How dare Schiff do this, I don’t care if those phone calls had evidence of Trump wanting a swastika tattoo and starting the fifth reich, THIS IS WORSE!

[comment]They should impeach pelosi
[comment]So glad I voted for him: )
[comment]This can play out in 3 ways. 

1) The democrats will cry corruption and play the victim card as they always do

2) The left will wake up and ask why Pelosi delayed the AOI.

3) Pelosi will be forced to turn over the AOI and the real fun can begin.
[comment]The biggest irony, is that the Democrats (Pelosi in particular) have themselves are guilty of abuse of power (frivolous use of impeachment) and obstruction of congress (not releasing the articles of impeachment to the senate, thus obstructing them from carrying out the due process).  
I honestly don’t know why anyone would vote for them. Over the last 4 years, they’ve ignored the outcome of the election and now they’re trying to reverse it. That’s the type of behaviour you’d expect in a dictatorship. The Steele dossier and spying on Trump’s election campaign, should have been enough to reveal them as the authoritarian hypocrites that they are.
[comment]good for him, it’s time to put the shenanigans behind us and get back to basics.

[comment]Now is this because the adf is getting bigger or because they're muslin population is much bigger? Curious
[comment]That was why Markel allowed the millions of muslims in to Germany, to finish Adolf’s job and to conquer Europe using the EU as a vehicle.
[comment]How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?
[comment]Pretty sure this story isn’t going to be covered by the MSM
[comment]What does the “biased domain” tag mean?
[comment]See? It's not just in America.
[comment]Are you really telling me why only 50% of crimes are solved on average magically antisemitic crimes have a rate of over 95% showing these are all far right? Antisemitic crimes are defined as far right. All unsolved cases are counted as far right. You are willfully ignoring reality to stay in your bubble. Don Quixote fighting windmills made of swastikas.
[comment]Antizionism, protesting against Israel, not judaism
[comment]Jews are responsible for the muzzie invasion of Europe, now it's coming back to bite them on the ass. And of course, the Jew controlled media makes it look like it's whites doing it, when it's not. And remember all the fake crimes that are done and reported by Jews!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Democrats see coronavirus as just another crisis to exploit
[selftext]https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/14/democrats-see-coronavirus-just-another-crisis-expl/[comment]Shameless and disgusting partisanship in the face of a national health crisis.

But for the Democrat party, par for the course.
[comment]Yes, yes they do.
[comment]This is the hoax that the president was referring to - the dems and their media trying to capitalize on this by causing a panic and doing as much damage as they can to the economy.
[comment]"You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before." --Rahm Emanuel
[comment]They always make everything political. And it's never their fault. Even when it is, it's conservative/Republicans fault...
[comment]This Republican president literally put millions of lives at risk by announcing the crisis to be under control and nothing to worry about. Only to flip 24 hours later with the truth because those closest to him finally stood up and said he was being a jackass I needed to stop speaking out of the side of his face. You want to try to latch onto politicians doing what politicians do that’s fine but everything the Democrats are trying to do, is the result of a president who’s done nothing.
[comment]Maybe President Trump should have done a better job preparing our testing infrastructure in the 2 months he had to get ready for this threat? 

This is how democracy works, when you do a shitty job, which Trump has personally (Coronavirus is a hoax, I take no personal responsibility for the testing rules and regulations) you get hit for it. It’s a carrot and stick system, you get rewarded for good actions and held accountable for bad. 

Also, where was this spirit of bipartisanship when Obama was implementing his recovery plan? We’re Republicans being ‘bad Americans’ for criticizing him?

The Democrats are doing their job, pointing out the failures of the Trump administration. The real problem is that it took up until late this week for Trump to do his and publicly acknowledge this threat for the acute threat it poses.
[comment]While the Corona virus was spreading overseas the asshat Democrats were busy with their peach mints.  Nothing else mattered to them.
[comment]Wait until the soft debate tonight (new rules for protecting Biden). The politicizing of a pandemic to criticize the right. Honestly, I can't see Biden getting through this but we soon shall see.
[comment]It may be dangerous, but it doesn’t mean it is the end of the world. There have been pandemics like this before and guess what the world moved on.
[comment]This place is becoming just like r/politics.
[comment]So do Republicans.  They tried to sneak abortion restrictions and banning encryption into bills relating to the virus.  It's just politics as usual.
[comment]When did this sub become r/politics 2.0?
[comment]Didn't Trump try to buy the pharmaceutical company that has been closest to creating a vaccine so he can sell it for a profit? That sounds like a pretty big exploit of a crisis.
[comment]Trump went from saying that the virus was a democrat hoax to national emergency in one week. Do you have brain damage?
[comment]This is true, someone has to get them under control, they are terrifying people, closing schools, making online learning illegal where I live (because it is “not fair” to the kids without wifi), and closing all sorts of businesses (which shouldn’t be possible in a free country). They want millions to die and they also want the economy to tank, all of their other plans have failed. PLEASE STOP THEM, THEY ARE KILLING THE NATION! PLEASE! Actually please!<|endoftext|>

Do as I say NOT as I do.
[comment]Rules are for ye not for me

-Her probably
[comment]Total Dem hypocrisy as usual. Put a damn hat on for interviews if ya need to. We all care about personal hygiene. Dems have ruined Chicago &amp; Illinois and will ruin the US if we don’t stand up to them NOW.
[comment]Staying at home order is for the peasants, not the ruling class
[comment]Total hypocrisy and an embarrassment. Even in /r/chicago we are all pissed. “Do as I say, not as I do” is very true.
[comment]Rules for thee but not for me.

Cuomo got a haircut too.
[comment]RULEZ FOR THEE, NOT FOR ME!!!
[comment]Deeeyum, she owl up in niss gih-in hurr hair didz!
[comment]Why does she even need a stylist? She literally has a little boys “buzz cut.” You can do this on your own with a pair of clippers, a number 2 clip and a blindfold.
[comment]Cuomo did too.
[comment]Scumbag commie pig. And that's not all.
[comment]How petty! You think republicans aren’t getting haircuts in their homes?
[comment]If I know a family member that can give haircuts, I would have long ago. As it is, I'm on my own and need the barber shops to re-open already. These rich folks have their own stylists on standby probably.
[comment]No I'm pretty and not a communist scumbag do as I say not as I do POS.
[comment]It’s because the stay-at-home orders aren’t there to protect people.

They’re there to hurt the economy and our president. This whole thing is a giant liberal scam that everybody is falling for
[comment]Did my first self attempt with the buzz clippers today.  Not great, not horrible.
[comment]Damn, fuckin hypocrites. Now they're somehow going to blame Trump for this somehow.
[comment]What did he "flow-be " break? WTF kinda hair style dies she have..
[comment]Do what I say, not as I do
[comment]People need to understand that when politicians make rules, they have NO intention of applying said rules to themselves or their lackeys.
[comment]"Rules for thee" Democrats need to be public office unemployed forever! Vote their corrupt asses onto the streets now!!!
[comment]Chicagoan here, the number of locals who support and defend this is insane. And they're quick to support her "don't walk too far" nonsense, too. The leftist hive mind is all too real.

Very few lead by example.

[selftext]https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/polling/poll-finds-23-american-voters-say-voting-mail-would-increase-voter-fraud[comment]What does the data say about voter fraud by mail?  Who gives fuck about a poll?
[comment]Just because a bunch of ignorant people think something doesn't make it the truth. Americans are really easy to persuade. The military votes by mail every year. Can our party get back to real issues now?
[comment]Just Two Thirds? LoL
[comment]Just what the democrats had in mind.
[comment]Where’s the proof there would be fraud?
[comment]People have been gathering and lining up at grocery stores for months so just put the voting booths there since Democrats don’t complain about those locations
[comment]What do actual professionals think?
[comment]But that is how the Democrats will "get rid of Trump," despite losing the election.
[comment]If its vote by mail it will be a fraud fest.
[comment]This post is a joke.
[comment]I just don't understand this. Who is it that people don't trust? Is it the mailman, the (elected)supervisor of elections, each other? I would go to the polls to cast my vote but I'm not sure my parents would. Nobody should have to choose between perceived safety and our right to vote.
[comment]Polls by whom?
[comment]Brit here. We have it, it did.
[comment]The real issue is can a state do it securely and fairly. Ohio barely did it because they have 2 decades of vote by mail experience, with 20% of their voters already doing it.
New York has 1% that vote absentee and had no infrastructure set up, so they straight up cancelled their primary election.
[comment]1200 was the same size for this.... US population:~328.2 million....1200/328,200,000*100=.000365% was the percentage of the US population that took this survey.... and now represents 62% of Americans (203,484,000 people). Also 272/1200 people took this survey online, how hilariously ironic! Thanks for not reading before you post.
[comment]Having traveled extensively for work, I started voting absentee over 30 years ago. Fraud never crossed my mind. My ballot arrives in the mail, I fill it out, I send it in. I don't see how any effort to circumvent this, in a meaningful way, would occur.
[comment]And the other third knows it but just will not say it!
[comment]Public opinion polls are meaningless
[comment]not sure how it isn't 100%. 

Would phone in purchases of booze increase underage alcohol consumption?
[comment]Seriously?
[comment]I strongly believe that voting by mail would help prevent voter fraud. In fact I don’t think that there is any significant amount of voter fraud in this country. Hell you can barely get people to vote in the first place. Remember that committee that Kris Kobach ran, they disbanded because they didn’t find any evidence of voter fraud.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/30/twitter-and-social-media-are-a-cancer-on-our-civic-life-they-dont-deserve-protection/[comment]They are a cancer because under the excuse of being private they have attempted to portray their "portal" virtue allowing people to express themselves while at the same time censoring conservatives and manipulating search results to promote the left agenda.   When you have mega corporations like these trying to politically influence elections its time to regulate them or terminate them.
[comment]The beauty of living in a free society is that you could simply choose to not use Twitter if you don't like it so much. It would be frustrating if Twitter were the only option for social media... Maybe someone should, I don't know, boycott it
[comment]Just delete your Twitter account.
[comment]100% agreed! 

That would put an end to all these disinformation campaigns, hate incitement, vicious and baseless accusations, fake news, blatant lies, doxing, etc. Social media gave a voice to many who needed to be heart, but also to MANY more who should never have been able to get to any kind of audience. They should be accountable for what they provide their platform as a tool.
[comment]Then don't use it, take your business elsewhere
[comment]The problem with Twitter and Social Media in general is that it gives everyone an equal platform to voice their opinions. The problem is not all opinions are equal and don’t deserve any platform with which to be heard.
[comment]To all those who are saying “dOnT uSe iT”. I believe this guy is trying to say, and I could be wrong, that there is an overall negative affect on society as a whole, costs outweigh benefits. And this problem won’t be reconciled if this singular user “sToPs UsInG TwiTtER” and goes “sOmEwHeRe ElSe”
[comment]Yeah but so are republicans so 🤷‍♀️
[comment]Yeah but that doesn’t mean we have the right to shut them down. Let people do what they want. Just hold yourself accountable to the values you place on others.
[comment]They are only as cancerous as the people who use them.
[comment]Social media is really a cancer that eats away your mental healthy slowly, try deleting Facebook, WhatsApp or any of the social media apps, think about how much more productive you will, I deleted WhatsApp a few months ago, Facebook a week ago. The whole Zuckerberg ecosystem is just bad and unhealthy, for example: Instagram is just an illusion and a bubble, people live in it and it eats away their life. Reddit too is bad mainly because you end up arguing with people who have no clue what the hell they're talking about.
[comment]Delete
[comment]Yeah, that's true, can't go on any social media with a bunch of you retards talking about coronoa hoax, 5g, and bitching about people calling out your limp dick leader for lying. Why don't you all fuck off from the internet?
[comment]I agree but also ironic when the republican president puts out so many tweets per day
[comment]Don’t use it then.
[comment]As much I can agree they are toxic at many times, they are the only platform for widespread conversation about American politics. Many republicans have come out and said they are cancerous because of censorship but do not understand that without these platforms there would simply be no platform for anyone do discuss and evolve their ideas.
[comment]Twitter should be shut down, they suck big time just like Jack.
[comment]He said as he posted on a social media site.
[comment]Hey Pelosi, Maxine, Crying Chuck, Biden, how proud are y’all of your voter base now?
[comment]Great article!
[comment]Media is an underlying cause of our divisiveness and hate.  Being in everyone’s homes on a nightly basis perpetuating hate, and lies against their opponents has brainwashed the entire country and has led to the situation we are in now.
[comment]Yeah no kidding. Wish we had arrived at that conclusion before it became an official policy tool of the state. It’s too easy for liberals to be validated by people with no stake in this country as they shout into the void.

[comment]Don't take it lightly. Ask Steve Scalise if he does. Bernie attracts radicals and they have nothing to lose.
[comment]What? This is fake news 100%
[comment]I worry that Bernie won't know the first thing about executive power and will let the lunatics into his administration. He's not going to know how to pick a cabinet or surround himself with wise counsel. His court will be full of inexperienced fire-brand extemists who have no idea how to wield power. I predict that his administration will resort to iron-fisted and poorly executed methods to exercise his agenda. Do we have any evidence that Bernie knows the first thing about executive power?
[comment]If you put the spotlight on crazy all you see is crazy.
[comment]Mark my words, if any sort of riot occurs, I guarantee people will defend them selves. And they they will utilize their Second Amendment right to do so.
[comment]What kind of Facebook post looking click bait is this crap? Just because someone supports Bernie doesn’t mean they are trying to burn cities. Just means they don’t understand economics or they want “free” stuff.
[comment]Why do Bernie supporters want to kill almost the whole country?
[comment]This is Russian Troll Trap garbage. Pumped out to cause division here in the USA.  Its wel documented that chaos and a weakened US government is Putins goal.

[comment]Amazing!!!
[comment]Another reason is high taxation on businesses causes failing businesses, which in turn causes the working class to lose their jobs, and then everybody is poor a great equalizer.
[comment]I get what this is saying, and I don't think anyone should get a free ride. This country was built on hard work and the people who work harder should get more reward. But what about people who work hard but still get a rough shake? Some people inherit great careers and wealth from great parents, but some other people also inherit nothing from shitty parents. I don't want handouts for those people, but it's unfair to say that a shitty life is entirely their fault because they don't work hard. I know plenty of people bringing in a lot of income for doing jack shit.

[comment]I’ve got to show this to a few people.
[comment]The next stages is where the administration steps in and says that they expect passing grades.  So the teacher grades on the curve and everyone gets a B no matter what.  It's a change from economics knowledge backed grades to fiat grades.  For a while, everything looks like it's working.  But before long the grade inflation catches up and people realize the grades are worthless.
[comment]I'm inclined not to believe this. The administration would have stepped in to make sure the students got the grade they earned fair and square.

[comment]Then everyone clapped...
[comment]I'm going to start showing this.
[comment]I always see these socialist students say “It’s the best thing ever because it’ll make everything equal” but as soon as you ask if someone who didn’t study should get your grades, or it should be equalized, SUDDENLY, that’s not fair because “I worked for my grades and they didn’t”

For some reason this applies to money but in life, they want to work for the reward
[comment]Does anyone have any Insightful responses to why it’s so popular in the media? Like I read this article and it makes perfect sense but you have die hard Bernie fans who swear it will work.  Like thousands and thousands of them. 
Is there something we’re missing? How is one portion of the population so naive to its ravages? I just can’t wrap my mind around it
[comment]Democrat, staunchly anti-trump here. If Bernie is our nominee ... I will be deeply disappointed. I'm actually shocked he's doing so well in the polls right now. I may do a write-in or vote independent if he ends up with the nomination.
[comment]This needs to be read by everyone on earth
[comment]Beautiful
[comment]But the person at the top of the capitolist tree just makes the rest of the students do the work for an F while taking A* without having touched a book
[comment]In order for socialism to succeed, one would have to have great pride in ones country. That way, you’re suffering for the greater good and your work goes towards a country you believe in. However, Americans are now being taught to hate their own country, kneeling in front of the world and not just domestic sports like American football. For the other half of America who still believes in democracy, they wouldn’t be able to put forth the effort needed to succeed in a communist country.
[comment]The problem is every generation or so sees this shiny prize at the edge of the cliff and assumes that the reason socialism fails is that those stupid old people were just not advanced or smart enough to implement it properly. It is like the gun control experts assume that to end all violence and crime is to eliminate all guns. The real variable that disrupts the equation is human nature and free will. And try as they might to beat and slaughter it out of society the Nazis, Communist etc. could not achieve it. I liken it to that old myth about Lemmings. Every new generation goes bailing off the cliff without understanding their decision or anyway of turning back assuming “I am going to be the one that makes it”. But gravity thou art a heartless bitch. The US is the lemming at the top of the cliff selling paper wings and Mylar balloons. If the US falls to socialism is implemented in the US the world economic crash will produce a political and economic nightmare that we might not climb out of for 100 years. We are literally the last real bulwark between a totalitarian world and a free one. Don’t count on China if the US economy fails China falls quick, over half of their precarious economic stability is all US funded. Without the US dollar China will boil over into a billion near cannibals burning communist party members on open pyres.
[comment]Socialism and communism are not the same and its a false equivocation to discuss as such. It would be like saying capitalism/fascism. No one is suggesting the economic equivalent of this situation.
[comment]You know this is fake right?

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/social-injustice/
[comment]And sadly, it was not enough to convince the entitled young folk who went on to vote for Bernie sanders anyway.

[comment]Curious what his annual income is post Presidency and what steps he’s taken to secure it
[comment]Well he knows his endorsement could cause more devision, and by staying silent he plans to try a last minute push to counter trump. It’s a decent idea considering how Democrats are tearing eachother up atm.
[comment]I don't see what the big deal is here. Obama has too much influence here, he wants to let the voters speak. If he steps in now, it gives a huge bump to whoever he endorses. He will likely wait and then endorse and campaign for the nominee.
[comment]In his water front estate screaming about climate change
[comment]I saw someone call Obama a republican the other day on r/politics
[comment]An Obama endorsement would only hurt Democrats.

He could shoot his load early and endorse Joe. Obama alienates the Bernie people and hurts the Dems. He alienated the Bernie supporters and a good chunk vote for Trump. If Joe loses, the “Bernie Would’ve Won” people blame Obama.

If Obama endorses Bernie, the dem establishment and Joe collapse and moderate Dems don’t vote or vote for trump.

Obama’s best move is to wait to for Joe to pick a VP , and if that VP is super popular and it looks like Joe has an edge, Obama comes in to push Joe PVE the line.

[comment]Enjoying his millions in peace
[comment]Agreeing with them full stop.   Obama does not disagree with communism.  He helped it around the world and praised the "positive" of communism and even told venezuelans there really is no difference between silly capitalist/communist labels.  Just vote for what {feels good} is right.
[comment]Obama is part of the movement toward Socialism and he's working in the background.
[comment]Obama doesn't give a shit about any of that. He just wanted to the pay day of being the president and he's cashed in on that like no other. The party falling to shit means nothing because Trump already destroyed any political legacy he was ever going to have and since it doesn't benefit him he just doesn't care. He'd rather be making absurd money helping Netflix come up with some half baked TV show.
[comment]Obama will walk up wearing a MAGA hat and say that he purposely sabotaged the Democratic party™ to pave the way for Trump, then he will jump onto the Trump steamroller alongside the Republicans as it flattens everything in its path.

[comment]Honestly I don't mind Obama staying out of it.

Former presidents should wait until a nominees pick and then get behind them
[comment]The dems have been supporting the “middle class” as their platform, but truthfully the last 25 decades of democrats haven’t really represented the middle class. Just like the republicans, they bend over for lobby money.

Hence, the evolution of the democratic class will naturally converge with a candidate that actually supports the middle class. Calling it socialism is just as stupid as calling trump a nazi. Regardless, his principles undermine our values of capitalism for sure which is why I’m so doubtful.

But this started when dems began accepting lobby money during the Clinton era. They kept losing elections because money bought republicans over and over again. 3 decades later, Democrats are trying to undue that one decision.

Quite unfortunate, you’re big business bitch now. You don’t represent the middle class, how can you?

So shut the fuck up about this socialism shit. I feel for these people, although I don’t agree with their philosophies

[comment]Well, there is one thing Mark and I agree on. I bet he may know something we don't though.

[comment]Ben Shapiro talked about this on his show yesterday and he said to all of the people attacking Facebook to be careful because Elizabeth Warren controlling Facebook is infinitely worse than the petty and minor grievances people have against the company.
[comment]The rest of society doing well apparently sucks to Mark.
[comment]I actually don’t completely disagree with Zuckerberg or Warren on this particular subject. 

It’s very much a two way street. Facebook has clearly, as Warren stated in her tweet, crossed the line into a very manipulative and corrupt business. Many tech companies have and Google is the one we should be most scared of hands down.

The issue is our government should really not be getting that deeply involved with a normal business. It could just as easily be a cover for both republicans and democrats to try and take a grip on a vein of social power like Facebook, like they already have with journalism.

Ideally it should be the populace who see corruption in a business and stop investing into their product. Move to a different company; however in the case of big tech you have a lot of people too addicted to change. 

Idk honestly all around it’s a really sticky situation and it doesn’t seem like it has an outcome that is fair.
[comment]I agree. As I don't think he's a fan of Trump what would he do if she won the nomination?
[comment]He ain’t lying
[comment]He's right y'know.

Socialism is all the rage until it it turns its greedy eye your way, points at you with its boney finger at you, and tells it insatiable hordes to feed.
[comment]**MANUFACTURED CONSENT**

"Wallstreet fears an Elizabeth Warren presidency" - The Hill

"Warren has put the fear of god into Wallstreet" - Axios

"Elizabeth Warren 2020 has Wallstreet very angry" - Vox 

"Wallstreet is scared of Elizabeth Warren" - CNBC 

Elizabeth "Capitalist To My Bones" Warren poses no threat to this immoral/rigged system. It's all fake. A fluke to prevent an actual reformist from being elected. The purpose of this manufactured bullshit is to sway politically illiterate "progressive" voters towards supporting Warren over the only actual candidate the wealthy fear. I don't even have to say his name. You already know. 

The 1% wouldn't tell voters who to vote for if they want to stick it to the 1%. That's why Warren gets all the attention from the mainstream propaganda machine while Voldemort's name is rarely mentioned unless it's negative news. 🌹
[comment]Good,,, now slap it all over Facebook.<|endoftext|>
