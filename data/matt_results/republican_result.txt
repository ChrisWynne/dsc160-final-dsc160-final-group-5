[title]Institutional Racism...
[selftext]https://external-preview.redd.it/33yo7J71Es7wFcLmwO9onmiFDw5amenSEl9zimUnWw0.png?auto=webp&amp;s=45b4502a274b046073c77e88289fe4b199501d0a[comment]If this gets brigaded I'll sticky it.
[comment]But he didn’t commit a violent crime...
[comment]Kaitlyn Bennet brought an AR-10 to her graduation and Tamir Rice was fatally shot for a toy gun.

Edit: I see this comment is not well favored and apologize to those offended. My point was to present to everyone what racial disparity can look like. He had dire consequences brought to him unlike her where as she was able to walk away with her life. Don’t quote me but Tamar was killed for being “armed” however the same did not apply to Kaitlyn. I hope everyone is doing okay x
[comment]Does this make cops less bad ?
[comment]Is there a source for this that I can show people?
[comment]Jesus
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/29/heres-why-we-dont-see-protests-when-police-unjustly-kill-white-people/
[comment]Source?
[comment]I understand we play the 'contrarian' attitude to whatever our opponents are feelings. But...we dont have to all the time. We can be willing to admit there are problems.
[comment]Interesting how the person that posted that is African American.
[comment]https://www.prisonpolicy.org/research/race_and_ethnicity/
[comment]what about all the people arrested and killed for nonviolent crime
[comment]Police brutality doesn't just encompass killings. There are endless videos of black people being brutally beaten by police while not resisting in any way. None of us should be supporting authoritarian violence against any race.
[comment]This kind of stuff is pushing me away from the party. This is plain ignorance that I cannot stand behind. Goodbye.
[comment]Despite the fact that African Americans commit 50% of the crime they only make up 30% of those killed by police[comment]Tweekers. Nobody is up in arms about tweeker deaths.
[comment]Jesus[comment]What’s truly sad about all this rioting is that it’s minority communities that are being destroyed and most likely will never rise up again
[comment]Such a stupid ass take. No one's denying law enforcement has a difficult job that may[comment]Another thought to add:

I'd figure that the arrest rates for African Americans are higher than it is for white people. They could have more deaths total but significantly more arrests which would be even worse.

Edit: I should proof read my spelling...
[comment]What the rioters are doing now[comment]This means nothing without context. If you have 1000 black people arrested and 4 of them killed during the process against 2 whites arrested with 1 of them killed[comment]Yea but also per capita isn’t taken into account[comment]So the problem is: A lot of people are cops that shouldn't be?
[comment]Ok. How many blacks/whites are killed during NON-VIOLENT arrests?
[comment]1. This small selected statistic (without citation of real data by the way)
2. George Floyd did not commit violence[comment]Do you guys not see that white people make up 70% of the crime and blacks make up like 29%. So by my math shouldn’t be that more whites should be killed by cops seeing how many crimes they commit.
[comment] Where are all the videos of cops actually using racial slurs? It's bad for anyone to die like that but damn it we need to focus on black on black crimes and fatherless families. And get off the plantation of welfare.
[comment] Well[comment]George Floyd wasn't committing a crime[comment]Ok so I just had a progressive argue against this point with me. Someone please chime in if they can refute it.

Their argument was sure more white men are killed by the police. Even though black men commit more of the crime. However the only reason black men commit more crime is because the black communities are over policed. 

So there is more from being committed in white communities but the police aren’t there to catch it because all the resources are spent in black communities.

My only arguments were what empirical evidence do you have for that? As well as low socioeconomic status tends to lead to more crime which is rampant in the black communities.
[comment]They dont care about police brutality at these protests. I was there.
[comment]Truth is 99% perception and 1% facts. add on top most people just want quick and easy answers to complex problems[comment]No[comment]But my emotions!
[comment]Can I see some stats on non-violent crime? Because most of the cases of black people killed by police were in cases where either they were being charged with a nonviolent crime[comment]Isn't the issue about brutality and killings without even being arrested?
[comment]Fake asshole!!!
[comment]What about non-violent
[comment]I’d be curious about how many were “justified” and the amount of armed vs unarmed
[comment]how about the peaceful black people being killed! you're a fake puppet!
[comment]Is it not clear that what's missing here is the number of African Americans arrested for non violent crimes that are killed. That's the hidden number here.
[comment]Yes but we don’t now what the black people did and what the white people did. It’s not a matter of fact how many gets killed it’s why
[comment]“Are Coos Racist” and “The War On Cops” by Heather Mac Donald are both brilliant books on the subject.
[comment]How about:

1) how many other cops have as many complaints against them and are still cops? 

2) who reviewed all of these complaints against this cop and decided he could still be a cop?

3) were any of these complaints ever brought to the attention of the mayor or DA? If so
4) these complaints should be reviewed by a committee that includes citizen representation.

If you really want to fix the system[comment]Are there stats for for non violent crimes and being killed by police? Also what about other races?
[comment]Y’all know data can be modified with it still be technically true right? There is a reason he didn’t post for all crime not just violent.
[comment]What about non violent crimes?
[comment]How is it possible?

It's a statistic not per 10
If 1
If one group commits 2 crimes per arrest and the other commits 3 crimes per arrest
What is the actual truth? Difficult to say without the numbers. But
Additionally[comment]How many more 10s of thousands of black people are arrested over whites though?
[comment]Without the numbers for people killed while being arrested for non-violent crimes or receiving a citation
The protests are about the use of excessive force on non-violent alleged offenders.
[comment]When were we talking about VIOLENT crimes?
[comment]This is the stuff we need more of.  I'm getting lit up by friends and family for standing by my ideal that this is a police issue[comment]If black people are arrested more frequently for violent crime than whites it would both account for this statistic and be evidence of pervasive policing bias. This one fact by itself isn’t really enough to prove anything though it does provoke interesting conversation. Also where is this stat from? Jc
[comment]More white males since 2017 have been killed by police than black males[comment]Yes and black Americans make up 13% of the population. All killing is bad
Anyone who wants a source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/
[comment]It’s not just about racism. It’s about the institutionalized police state. Black cops have abused the power to white civilians too. It’s not just racial but also an issue of police having zero accountability
[comment]Far too many people brigading this thread think this is some sort of attack on black people
I think the vast majority here recognize that black people disproportionately suffer from socioeconomic issues due to racism and other reasons. They are targeted for petty crime
But that doesn't change the fact that police killings are directly proportionate to violent crime. For whatever reason[comment]Although the links provided are still confusing as there is too much info i don't know where to look lol i'm just going to assume the numbers are correct. The way i see it is every person of every race should be treated equally and have the same priviliges. These figures just prove to me that we all need the band together in solidarity to make the change happen and kick racism once and for all. I am a white man from the UK and i've realised it's not enough to just not be a racist but we need to do something about it. The governments over the decades/centuries have had all the power to make this happen but they have chosen to ignore us and divide our nations and will continue to do so[comment]Simple explanation
&amp;#x200B;

This statistic here is misleading as it uses the simpson's paradox.
[comment]Where are the statistics for this clam
[comment]Whatsu the numbers on nonviolent crimes?
[comment]For those that want the data
[https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16\_fryer.pdf](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16_fryer.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also[comment]Wonder why BLM doesn’t protest black on black crime. Oh wait they think black on black crime is cause by white people
[comment]There's a lot of back and forth on that thread[comment]Tit for tat... that’s how I see it!
[comment]I think this country has a serious problem with systemic violence and institutionalized thuggery. We have come to expect and accept it[comment]Is this actually the guy in the photo? Or just another white supremacist catfishing? You're a fraud!!!
[comment]“There are three kinds of lies: lies[comment]Had to save this twice for good measure
[comment]You do realize that white people are 70% or so of the population and black people are 13% right? So when taking about absolute numbers[comment]As usual with the liberal left and Democrats in general

Always[comment][https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02601-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02601-9)
[comment]What I don't understand is how is Police Brutality against Black people a partisan issue? Why must we try and find justifications in murder of people? What the fuck is wrong with this country?
[comment]If you look at the statistics[comment] 60.6%  of the population are white 
12.3% are black 

So maybe run those numbers again.

[title]How is the left so dumb?
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/r3p4t6i2i2v41.jpg[comment]I dont think all of them are dumb it is just they blindly listen to the media and do whatever they say
[comment]Shouldn’t it say [comment]https://twitter.com/MichaelCoudrey/status/1254212267324784645?s=20
[comment]This is how one ends up on the left.
[comment]Some things the world may never know.
[comment]Why do you think it’s people on the left who are listening to Trump and following his advice? 

Poison control calls regarding exposure to household cleaners in NYC have gone way up since his comment.
[comment]Sometimes I wish they would and have natural selection sort them out. lol
[comment]i can't believe this is a real sub
[comment]I really don’t think it’s the dems that the drinking bleach joke is referring to. Its not like dems listen to Trump anyways[comment]I wouldn't even care if people drank or injected bleach or lysol at this point because you can't fix stupid and I'm tired of everyone having to try.
[comment]Left?
[comment]I was talking with my S/O about this today. The media has been so successful in convincing the left that Trump is so stupid that they genuinely believe stories like this now. 

If you hear the media report that a functioning adult said something so stupid that even someone with an IQ of 50 would know it's stupid[comment]Yes "misinterpreted"
[comment]Wouldn't they be the ones NOT listening to trump?
[comment]Trump didn't even say that lol[comment]Dude honestly I'm not voting for Biden. To be honest I cant vote for anyone. I'm from South Africa
Bidens a joke and a fool
To be honest it's hard to believe what's happen to America[comment]You guys remember a few years ago when people
&amp;#x200B;

My point is[comment]Darwinian for sure. If you’re that stupid ..
[comment]Wow it’s honestly refreshing to see conservatives be self aware enough to be okay with making fun of themselves. Well done OP
[comment]Here’s the reality: he could say the sky is blue and they’d find some way to object.  In this case[comment]The Right be like[comment]I’m pretty in the middle and what he said was still bad. Then to say he was being sarcastic. Maybe save the sarcasm for after a pandemic. 

Also why not just admit fault like ever.
[comment]well they elected a reality tv star so thats why
[comment]Listening to the full transcript of this and other Trump faux pas that got blown up

Do such impromptu statements by him get blown out of proportion?  Yes.  Does he need to learn to contain them better in order to better project calm leadership?  Also yes.
[comment]This post makes me want to leave this sub
[comment]These are the people who force politicians to speak a different language and be very rehearsed[comment]Keep Ina Garten out of this!
[comment]as a trumper i think he should control what he says
[comment]If they were average IQ or higher[comment]Dat projection
[comment]They ate Tide Pods so what did you expect?
[comment]Why on earth do you think the left are the ones listening to him?
[comment]Dont get me wrong[comment]The left has never been more of an ouroboros than they are with this stupidity. Not one person on the right is falling for this crap.
[comment]The only people who think he meant anything approaching reasonable are his lapdogs Even Trump disagrees with you. He's had to lie about it being sarcasm because even he realises what he said was dumb...why cant you?
[comment]Except it isn’t the left that is calling in asking if this works....
[comment]r/therightcantmeme
[comment]Cuz they went to college for liberal arts
[comment]Trump is perfect. Trump is divine. Trump is infallible.
[comment]The Trump deranged media obviously jumped all over this. For some[comment]If this is this subs biggest hangup and the libs fav (at the moment) drum to beat then damn we still got it pretty good!  He’s a great Prez and he’s denounced and demonized by every last person in the media[comment]Still he's the only Prez that has the guts to stand up to China
[comment]He seemed kinda direct about his statement. He just says dumb things.
[comment]Donald Trump: “I see the disinfectant
The right: “HoW iS tHe LeFt So Dumb?”
[comment]Wait I thought he was being sarcastic
[comment]They weren’t ever taught to think. Sheep since day one
[comment]This has to be a joke. 'misinterpreted'? You lot can't be that stupid
[comment]Impeachment didn't work[comment]oh[comment]this is an astonishingly stupid post
[comment]https://www.newsweek.com/gop-maryland-governor-says-state-received-hundreds-calls-asking-if-its-ok-ingest-clorox-after-1500274
[comment]You mean you trump lapdog are the stupid one right?
[comment]I won't be surprised if people on the left intentionally drank it to stir shit up.
[comment]The amount of people I made mad with this post is fucking hilarious XD
[comment]Are they just deleting every democrat comment?
[comment]Left: Omg he said inject disinfectant into the body
Right: No
Trump: I said it sarcastically[comment]You’d all be making memes of Obama doing this if he said exactly the same thing
[comment]If Trump didn't out right advise this...you all have to admit that he suggested it....

Take an honest look at what he said.....take a step out of the echo chamber
[comment]What did he mean by his statement then? I'm curious
[comment]Please don't ban me for this question[comment]How is that any American can possibly think the media is impartial? It's clear that they're out to attack him daily for any and every excuse they can make up. And we are supposed to trust them to fairly moderate the presidential debates? Trump should just bypass them and do something online directly for the voters.
[comment]These comments are why I left politics. Lol who the fuck would try and pretend that suggesting injecting disinfectant isn't some of the dumbest shit ever said.
[comment]So what did he mean?
[comment]Why is that liberals who have such an affinity for Socialism and Communism try to paint conservatives as fans of Putin?
[comment]you are very stupid and so is trump
[comment]Lol the left so stopid. MR. trump would never suggest this
[comment]I think the issue is not that people are stupid or may do stupid things. Many people from all social classes and all political wings are sometimes stupid or sometimes say stupid things. Many well educated people also do or say stupid things.
That is okExcept when you go on national television during a crisis and you are the President of the USA. Then you really need to put your game face on and be smart. There is no leeway for saying stupid things in such a situation.
Personally[comment]“I see the disinfectant
Did he tell people to inject or drink disinfectant? No.  But he suggested it be studied as a cure. It's like someone saying fire kills germs and suggesting we should get it "inside the body" to study it as a cure.
[comment]If you believe he was being sarcastic or making a joke[comment]Something that you inject that disinfects you from disease is called medicine. The fact it's even been suggested as something new to consider is worrying.
[comment]Let's run through the timeline of this shall we?

1. He says we should look into injecting disinfectants.
2. The media reports on what he said making him look incredibly stupid
3. Fox news and other right wing news outlets claim he's being taken out of context.
4. Trump
So tell me was he taking a national crisis lightly by being sarcastic? Was he taken out of context? Or is it more likely he's a bumbling fool? One would think all of you would say he was being sarcastic as that is what he[comment]Trump literally said

But setting all that aside

One of them was Breitbart News

[comment]Perhaps I dont know my president well enough[comment]So glad they didn’t forget my favorite. Calvin Coolidge!!
[comment]Is that Tony Stark? Oh wait[comment]They forgot approximately 150lbs on Trump’s torso.
[comment]Why Nixon? He's known as one of the worst. Watergate?
[comment]I am so very confused by the comments
[comment]I will find a way to frame this image to hang in the entrance hall of my house.
[comment]Funny how all the republican presidents were strong men compared to democratic. Excluding Truman. 
My opinion!
[comment]Fuck Teddy Roosevelt!!! P.O.S.!!!

I like that Peyton Manning is in a tie on the upper right side[comment]Why the hell would Teddy Roosevelt be there by Trump?  One was a conservationist[comment]TRUMP 2020!

[comment]Half of those guys would have honestly shot the other half by now. Extremely talented drawing but the subject matter is iffy.
[comment]Dude it’s ain’t beautiful[comment]I like how far they put Taft back there 😂
[comment]The fact that half the comments are calling this painting terrible shows that half this subreddit doesn't belong here
[comment]Painted by Andy Thomas. Good piece. The woman approaching in the background is supposed to be the first woman president. There are also a couple more nods in the piece.
[comment]Trumps head is too big.
[comment]I like it with Nixon in there. He makes the Donald fit in a little better.
[comment]The bush family would never sit at the table with Trump sadly.
[comment]My friend has this hanging in his house
[comment]No-Bama
[comment]You guys can call people libtards and cuks and communists all you want. But at least we don't have painting of other dudes up in our houses like a bunch of queers. You guys are fuckin gayyyyyy.
[comment]Wonder what the conversation would be about?
[comment]Where are the flames of hell.....
[comment]Add Jackson? Took on big banks and won
[comment]“And then I told them they were ‘Fake News’”
[comment]This shit's weird
[comment]Nice work[comment]Hilarious that Trump has a diet coke and same with Bush.
[comment]Roosevelt wouldn’t even go into the bar if he knew Trump was there. Or just toss him out by his pretty blonde hair.
[comment]Teddy Roosevelt was insanely progressive though..
[comment]Fantastic. No Obama to be found
[comment]Its funny because nixon and reagan are criminals and teddy and lincon dont stand for the things you people think they stand for.
[comment]Retard reality show host is lost in the conversation
[comment]This is ok but trump just looks straight up photoshoped
[comment]Remember when Presidents didn’t need photoshop to look serious? I will never forget Obama.
[comment]I'm a moderate dude and I love some of these guys but Trump seems wildly out of place here man.

[title]And this is why we need guns people! When the govt becomes a police state and comes to your doorstep shooting for you being outside your OWN house
[selftext]https://streamable.com/u2jzoo[comment]They’re using paintball guns[comment] Follow police orders you fucking idiots. What do you think is going to happen when you disobey orders from a group of terrified[comment]what are you going to do with your guns? shoot police officers? go to jail for life for killing a cop?
[comment]All over bully and shutting down barbers and restaraunts. But the riots start and no one is around.
[comment]It's a curfew[comment]Was this done because they weren't obeying curfew? A curfew imposed because were being criminals. The officer said "Stay in your home".
[comment]It’s how they are doing this. They look untrained. Lack of training and lowered standards is what cost the first life.
[comment]I bet people will be 100 times  happier to see these cops than a group of rioters burning down homes and property.
[comment]You’ll discover very quickly the difference between the police and military.
[comment]But if you got rid of all the guns then no one could shoot at you on your own porch.just saying this article seems a little flawed in how it sounds
[comment]Could someone tell me why this was quickly posted here but it took a while for it to appear on r/Conservative and it seems to be quite controversial there? Do these subs not have the same demographic?
[comment]I guess the government has decided the white neighborhoods need to get on board with the coming summer of rage.
[comment]The 2nd amendments purpose is literally for this situation
[comment]I would shoot them with my scout[comment]So what do you do when you run out of ammo after shooting back at the popo? This is when logic just crushes your entire argument
[comment]Given what happened here I wanted to clear up what is happening in Minneapolis. What happened last night was that the rioters were going into porches and pretending to live in some of the houses. This doesn’t excuse the behavior but I’m just explaining WHY they ordered her to get inside. 

The media also will not talk about the fact that police officers in Minneapolis were getting shot at and Molotov cocktails were being thrown.
[comment]I'm pro-gun and believe in keeping the government in check[comment]How would you shooting back have helped this situation?
[comment]I’m okay with the National Guard showing up to try and stop the riots that are hurting and killing people[comment]Where was this?
[comment]The entire MN police force seems to need retraining...
[comment]When ya act like assholes and loot &amp; burn shit down- that’s the result. Don’t be mad at the national guard or police- be mad at the assholes taking advantage of a situation.
[comment]That’s why we should be fighting to lower taxes on the middle class. All we are doing is giving more power to the government and less power to the people.
[comment]The title is very misleading[comment]Or try not burning down the city provoking factions specifically meant to establish order.
[comment]Kill the Nazi police officers on sight. Any officer "following orders" is a threat to civilian lives. They have no capability to think for themselves and no empathy to consider their victims' lives. Everyone needs to get their guns out now or arm up if you don't have any. Set traps around your house if you can.
[comment]We should all know the context of massive riots in Minneapolis.  Along with that[comment]No[comment]I wonder *why* they are patrolling in the first place[comment]We need to organize a counter-protest for the police[comment]Cops like these are nothing but Government boot lickers - no different than Nazi Germany!! 
“Just following orders” - Tyrannical cowards.
[comment]Bruh[comment]Yeah cause opening fire on a group of ~20 cops sounds like a great idea!
[comment]They want to be Democrats[comment]This will resort more protests because only in masses can the people stand up.
One individual guy shooting back will just resort in a gunfight. But protests involving thousands is a whole different ballgame.
[comment]Random pallets of bricks are just randomly showing up in downtown Dallas... this isn’t a protest[comment]Were riots nearby this neighborhood?
[comment]I say listen to the police orders to go inside
[comment]Reminds me of Modern Warfare 2. "Fall back to the Burger Town !"
[comment]I’m with you here OP. People seem to forget which side they are on. Anti-authoritarianism is what this is about; not just when it’s in their favor!
[comment]I can assure you opening fire on officers wouldn't help
[comment]It’s almost like the second amendment becomes functionally useless in the presence of actual authoritarianism.
[comment]While I’m not defending the shooting here[comment]I know this will get a lot of hate but:
A
I’m completely pro guns but the purpose of the 2nd amendment is not to protect against cops armed with paintball guns trying to control a riot.
[comment]Looks like ANTIFA sitting around planning. The National Guard said go back into your house. ANTIFA had a choice and they chose to disobey the authorities. These looters paid the price. Oh well.
[comment]Get inside sounds fine.
[comment]I actually am a big lefty and came here just to read what everyone on the right was saying right now and I just wanted to contribute that I agree[comment]Folks as bad as it looks
Can I be outside my house (on my property) after 8 p.m. and before 6 a.m.?

Yes. You can be on your porch<|startoftext|>

[comment]How come r/politics doesn’t show this stuff
[comment]r/cringe
[comment]So basically all the work he’s done while performing duties as a public servant are unfair to judge while he’s running for the biggest public servant job in the world? 

Got it....lol
[comment]I feel better now knowing Joe didn’t do it.
[comment]Does anyone else cringe every time he speaks? I almost feel bad for the guy. He literally can’t go two sentences without uttering nonsense words.
[comment]You know
Don’t be surprised if Billary gets called in from the Bullpen.
[comment]One part of this story bothers me.  If I filed a report 1) I would ask for a copy and 2) I would know the name of who I reported it to.

[comment]There will be a crisis over this. The party will twist and turn and finally put forth a candidate who has no chance.
[comment]What's wild is that people are saying Mika "pushed" Biden in this interview. She didn't ask him about the "hugs
Biden says the University of Delaware stuff can't be released because it has records pertaining to his job like his positions on topics and interviews. She should have asked why the public cannot see
This was a pretty softball interview overall
[comment]It’s hard to comprehend how hypocritical Biden is about his secrecy talking to foreign leaders when Biden and the left demand to know what was said and investigate Trump every time time he utters a word to any foreign leader.
[comment]so... don't release the records because they show my record and that can become "fodder"...

is he not proud of his record?

[comment]R/Politics says this isn’t a trial and it’s a job interview when Kavanaugh got accused so no due process is needed. Biden is interviewed for a job so he doesn’t need due process.

[title]The truth
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/ptea613ima251.jpg[comment]They aren't entirely wrong
There are clearly actors that are not part of the group instigating violence. It seems antifa is indeed acting within these protests. However[comment]Every republican ive talked to was an idiot. All republicans are idiots 🖕
[comment]BLM is a foreign funded insurgency. The BLM goons are out there to sow the seeds of discontent and gin up race hatred. If they were protesting hoping to make the world peaceful
A serial killer spends most of his time not stacking bodies[comment]Except that protesters are regular citizens who may not have the authority
Police officers do have the authority[comment]This is kind of a strawman that you're making here. Clearly not all protesters think ALL cops are bad[comment]The protestors do not believe all cops are bad[comment]I appreciate everyone here having a respectful and knowledgable debate[comment]These protestors are Patriots fighting against government tyranny.
[comment][this was my feed just now. ](https://ibb.co/ZY4CHfy)
[comment]Also - all gun owners are violent criminals


The level of mental gymnastics do these people should qualify for gold every time at the olympics.
[comment]Exactly. There so few people that don’t have double standards for everything.
[comment]No one polices the police. They get away with 10x more than any normal person. It's a pretty brutal difference. They should be held to a MUCH HIGHER standard than civilians[comment]Its a turd in the punchbowl situation for both sides.
[comment]Honestly I see the logic considering the protestors have been [seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/instantkarma/comments/gug5kf/peaceful_protest_not_raging_riots/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  actively turning the rioters to the police. The day the cops turn the tucked up ones in is when it’ll be equal
[comment]Do you fail to see the hypocrisy in this comment? The right has been telling us for years that "not all cops are bad and it's a few bad apples." Meanwhile[comment]This sub: Authoritarianism is bad

This sub: Protect and respect our boys in blue
[comment]This is not a political issue[comment]Playing devil's advocate: the cops are the ones who have the power[comment]I don’t see that is their claim at all[comment]Yeah but the protesters aren’t killing people every single day
[comment]The difference is it isn't the job of the peaceful protestors to stop rioters. It IS the job of good cops to stop bad cops.

The saying isn't "one bad apple makes the whole barrel LOOK bad" it is "one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel."

I don't think most cops are bad people
And that isn't me playing holier than thou. If I were a cop I probably wouldn't have the courage to turn in the bad cops either[comment]Police cannot have any “bad apples” that job like the military needs to have serious repercussions to anyone not doing their job properly.
[comment]Called the “not all Scotsman” rhetorical case if anybody is wondering
[comment]I personally don’t mind riots so long as they’re not geared towards innocent business owners[comment]But yes[comment]I mean the protest is that the system keeps letting this happen but sure[comment]As one user pointed out
https://web.archive.org/web/20200526121443/https://www.insidempd.com/2020/05/26/man-dies-after-medical-incident-during-police-interaction/

"he appeared to be suffering medical distress"

Yes[comment]The issue they are protesting is that the small group of bad cops are protected from persecution when they misbehave
[comment]If you‘re still supporting the cops you‘re farther deranged than Ben Garrison. Just saying.
[comment]The protestors themselves acknowledge this though
There isnt such an acknowledgement within the police force. Would a good man harboring a fugitive not also be legally responsible and charged?

Edit: a word
[comment]Republicans: you can't say all gun owners are violent when it's only a VERY SMALL group being violent! The majority of us use guns for peaceful things! 

Also Republicans: there are a few bad protesters out there so ALL protesters are bad!!

See the fallacy in "the truth" of your post?
[comment]I always thought school was dumb for trying to teach "critical thinking". Like[comment]Remember[comment]The problem is the cops get paid no matter who or how they kill.
[comment]This really isn't a political issue. You can support good cops and still support these protests. The issue stems from the fact that bad cops are not being punished severely enough. That Asian police officer should have told his fellow officer to get off his neck and helped him get up so they could just arrest him rather than stand there to defend his fellow officer. I don't know what went through in his mind but any sensible officer would have noticed that Floyd was in any way a danger to anyone. My brother-in-law is a cop. He damn sure ain't letting a co-worker of his do that in front of him. I respect the work a police officer does but it's not difficult to spot bad cops when you're around then unless you're also a bad cop.
[comment]Isn't the difference that the protesters are calling out the bad protesters for doing bad things while police officers don't call each other out for doing bad things like murder unarmed people?
[comment]Well you can argue that some bad protesters make the whole protest wrong while agreeing that some bad cops make an unjust system.

Or

There are some bad protesters
You’d be a hypocrite to believe that one group is all bad because of some bad examples while believing the opposing force simply has a few bad apples.

In a nutshell
Thanks for coming to my ted talk:)
[comment]It’s already been said but there’s bad people on both sides. But there’s a systemic problem here that happens all the time[comment]Citizen protestors vs cops who are supposed to work for them... exercising rights vs a job... proof that there are specific agitators in the protests vs endless footage of savage rioting cops... I wonder who’s in the right. Acab
[comment]i dont think protesting a child rapist is so bad
[comment]Tell me why I have to call my family and make sure they are safe because there’s all these protestors and looters going crazy and everyone is going down the street just shows they scare me more than cops how dumb
[comment]We can apply this logic to anyone in their tribe and demonstrate why it's unfair to label the entirety of the group due to a nonrepresentative minority commits the transgressions.

Black people? But not all...

Latino? But not all...
[comment]Which one is it
[comment]Two signs I saw from protesters that were extremely troubling. One said abolish the police. I’m like you need some organization to enforce the law or you have anarchy. The second was all policemen are klansmen. I mean cmon a lot of police officers are black or other minorities. This is an egregious overstatement. There are racist cops but a small minority. No one will take you seriously if you say stupid shit like that
[comment]They are protesting a systemic problem[comment]Almost like protesters didn't take an oath to protect and serve and then go around killing people who can't fight back with impunity or something.
[comment]I don’t think anyone thinks all cops are bad. Even if it’s a small percentage (1% let’s say)
The bigger problem is not the bad cops themselves[comment]Maybe they should have sent the national guard to deal with the “small” percentage of bad cops before rioting began.
[comment]Protesters are exercising a constitutional right. Rioters are not. Good cops follow the rule of law and protect individuals constitutional and legal rights. Bad cops break the law in their enforcement[comment]Most cops are good[comment]this is not true
[comment]Of course[comment]Literally makes no sense.

Protesters do not necessarily form coherent group. There is no "protest leader" that can stop bad people from joining in the protest
Police do form groups[comment]This is a strawman  because the movement isn't saying all cops are badThe protest is about ending the cycle and the only way that can happen is if more accountability is legislated. That is the movement in a nutshell.

I personally feel cops should get a huge pay increase akin to doctors[comment]Man[comment]I swear this would have been great 2 weeks ago when society allowed you to live in your own bubble and think every POC was lying about police issues but now if that’s how you feel then so be it
[comment]Well who’s Fault is that ?
[comment]We have to get them to achieve more in school.
[comment]Thats not an apples to apples comparison. The problem's with the system/culture that's ingrained into the police. That doesn't make the individuals themselves bad or corrupt. The protestors are not an organized force[comment]Hypocrites: A few bad apples doesn't mean that all police are bad
Also hypocrites: There are few people taking advantage of the protests to loot and riot. ALL PROTESTERS ARE LOOTERS AND RIOTERS.

Temporary is pretty subjective.

[comment]Republicans and their lack of logic and critical thinking skills
[comment]To those out there who think flattening the curve is the cure:

Flattening the curve isn't going to stop the virus.  Too many people keep thinking that the lock down is going to be the cure to stop the virus when the curve is flattened. That's not how this works or has worked or will work.

It's simply helping ease the virus infection rate that *is* going to occur to the same number of people as though we hadn't quarantined. That's the whole point. Expect to get it at some point (if you haven't already had it
The curve flattening was to help our health system stay on top of it and keep from being over-burdened. It's inevitable that everyone's going to get it eventually. That's an established fact. (again if you haven't already had it and didn't realize it
There *will* likely be a spike in cases for a short (emphasis) period as people start to get back to life and states  (and frankly other countries) start phasing in re-opening their economies[comment]Wasn't it the Republican party that under cuts educational programs and after school programs.

(only saying since I'm in a red state and my wife is a teacher) so educational standards are not a main priority for Republicans[comment]Schools are concentrated areas with hundreds and thousands of kids and planned parenthood has a lot less people at a time and they don't only do abortions they have other functions.

[comment]How dare you!!!
[comment]Ocean plastic and climate change are different issues. Fighting climate change requires policy changes since we need to reduce carbon emission in the future. Boyan's method to clean up plastic waste attacks part of that problem but not all of the plastic in the ocean ends up in the garbage patches.

[comment]The Donald was the only thing left that was keeping this place from eating itself alive[comment]WTF kind of article is that? 🤣 The Left always plays the victim card. The race card. They invent crap like "White Privilege " and a gender gap just so they can pretend to be victims.
[comment]Conservative victim hood? They really just project all of their own stuff onto their opponents to feel better about themselves don't they.
[comment]"&gt; It was likely inevitable that the pandemic would get sucked into the hysteria industrial complex

This is exactly what the left does with EVERYTHING! How do they do deeply lack any self awareness?
[comment]I don’t often see good responses against the points they’re making in that thread though? How do I know they’re not right about it
[comment]Yeah those libs love their echo chambers. Let me just post and complain about that on a subreddit of people that all agree and think like me.
[comment]Disgusting

[comment]how did we allow it to become this????
[comment]I’m fairly new to reddit and my first decision was to comment a few of my republican viewpoints on r/politics[comment]One common claim in that thread is that disagreement isn’t allowed in r/conservative. 

It just isn’t true. I’ve had spirited debates within the subreddit many times.

[comment]So a crime against a woman[comment]No. It was never about MeToo or believing women.  It was always and only about power.
[comment]Ok two can play at that[comment]I wonder if they think Tara Reade has to vote for Biden?
[comment]They don’t give a shit about women[comment]God damn if only the DNC could get somebody normal. In my personal opinion I want Donald Trump in office[comment]Ok then "believing" her means absolutely nothing[comment]Next level TDS
[comment]For those women who are ok with this being a fact and you are still voting for Biden[comment]Gotta give it up to them for being honest. Still shitty double standard though.
[comment]People with these sentiments are going to regret saying this. It may not be tomorrow or even next year     
    
Seasons and tastes change   
The Dems need a mission. Their mission was social justice   
If the dems had just taken a prudent and thought out strategy they could've easily defeated Trump. They are stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. They need a campaign strategy that speaks to the common middle-of-the-road American. They need to cut the hard   
Think about the miners and and factory workers that mother jones organized and unionized in the early 20th century. Those peasants would have no quarter in today's Democrat party. They believed in Christian-based family values  
So[comment]Not surprised even a little bit.
[comment]This is disgusting. Not unexpected perhaps[comment]What sane woman would vote Democrat at this point 

[ rhetorical[comment]"oRaNge MaN bAd!"
[comment]Moral bankruptcy of the left
[comment]They have no shame. It does not surprise me.
[comment]They also believe the many Trump accusers[comment]So they just admitted that none of this #metoo crap had anything to do with justice for women.
[comment]Lost cause. Ignore them and focus on people that still have a chance.
[comment]The left showing once again that they will sacrifice their morals if it means winning.

So desperate..
[comment]Mental illness should not be encouraged and stupidity is not a superpower.
[comment]So Bret Kavanagh is all good now. Glad we cleared that up.
[comment]The DNC is awful and corrupt and I’m not a fan of joe Biden. Having said that[comment]That’s honestly disgusting
[comment]Just proves #metoo only works if the person is a republican. It could come out that Biden was just as bad as Jerry Sandusky and people would still vote for him. The silence from the me too movement is deafening.
[comment]Honestly I think you shouldn’t be able to report it 5 years after it happened especially if the person has became famous or rich
[comment]Gotta cheer for the team no matter what.
[comment]It’s (D)ifferent when we do it!
[comment]Joe Biden's support for abortion outweighs any past misdeeds for feminists.
[comment]This makes it clear that the Kavanaugh situation had nothing to do with believing women or caring about sexual assault. They found a guy they didn't like and did everything they could to destroy him. They didn't care with Bill Clinton and they don't care now with Joe Biden. I hope the American people can see through their bull shit.

Even anecdotally
So if they’re both disgusting in reference to women[comment]Of course they are because the me too movement was full of shit.
[comment]It's actually not that difficult of a concept. Given the option of two rapists[comment]What a lot of people don’t seem to grasp is that most Democrats believe all of Trumps accusers are telling the truth and that the infamous grab em by the pussy tape is an actual confession of sexual assault.  So it’s literally voting between 2 sex offenders for president.  And if you use that logic
Just gonna put that out there and say that I’m not a Republican[comment]It would help if we all recognize that the primary process as it currently works is failing all around (not just Dems).  We are in transition from a time when stage one of the primary process occurred out of sight before a single vote is cast
With that said
In the highly likely event that Biden is the nominee
* Candidate B:  one credible accusation of assault and known behavior that has made some women uncomfortable* Candidate T: many accusations of assault
Where is the hypocrisy here in pulling the level for Candidate B[comment]I’m making a principled vote for someone I believe to be an actual rapist. That’s some really galaxy brain shit.
[comment]Policy over party

It's fair to be concerned about authoritarian power grabs
People have been throwing around ideas like opening up the country "slowly
If an organization of doctors[comment]Yes...  But good luck having an intelligent exchange of ideas with anyone convinced we should all be locked in our homes awaiting the impending doom of civlization.
[comment]It pains me that many republicans are protesting against social distancing for reasons like “getting their hair cut”. So what if we have the freedom and rights to be outside? If you love this country stay home and keep our people safe
[comment]But if you care about people losing their jobs and consider a tiered opening of the country it means you want to open up the country tomorrow with no restrictions and you want everyone to die

[comment]Can we have an extra circle for drinking bleach?
[comment]I feel this post hits the nail on the head. I am a republican conservative and believe we should take the virus seriously. However some states such as California and Nevada are taking this out of proportion. We cannot be confined to our homes that long and simply watch the economy fall. I believe we should all have the choice to quarantine or not. Millions of people are now unemployed and suffering from poverty. However I also believe that those that are high risk such as my grandparents (70) (78) or other people over the age of 50 or those with underlying conditions. We all need to face the virus and gain herd immunity. To conclude far too many people are suffering from poverty and unemployment to continue this mandatory lockdown any longer. But as I said I feel all high risk people such as those with underlying conditions should continue their quarantine. 

Post scripture
Very few or no healthy people under the age of 50 with no underlying conditions have died from this virus. There are viruses that are far more deadly that we’re not quarantining for such as TB. We need to face this virus and get over it[comment]Yep

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/3z9u4jpovih41.jpg[comment]No no no[comment]Feminist is just another word for a whore.

[comment]IMO the abortion debate is less about the act itself but more when we consider life to begin. Whether that’s conception[comment]Feminists? Really?
[comment]There would be a lot of false rape claims. Oh wait....
[comment]I may be over simplifying it but is the DNC procedure not the cure for both rape and incest? Is that incorrect? Not a doctor
[comment]If a woman can choose whether or not to abort the baby without the fathers consent because she doesn’t want it
But they ain’t ready for that talk. It’s all “let’s push for women to have MORE rights than men in the name of ‘equality’!”
[comment]I’m totally pro-life but sooooo many more woman would have false rape accusations.
[comment]Committing another horrible act doesn't make the original horrible act go away. The child is innocent.
[comment]I would stand behind the view of a doctor[comment]It honestly should not be legal until we have a general consensus on when life begins. Why is abortion legal with so many unanswered questions and somethign like smoking weed isn't. We know just about all there is to know with something like that and they are still cautiously going about legalizing it
I understand people believe weed should be illegal but in that case so should tobacco and alcohol. But in this case i was just using it as an example since it is still a relatively popular and current topic.
[comment]Yeah but people like Ted Cruz dont want that. Some of these pro life people dont care about that kid once it pops out.
[comment]The way I see it is[comment]Have never once seen anyone say “We need abortion FOR rape and incest”
[comment]I believe it should still be a liberty a woman has as a free American[comment]I still disagree. If you believe that abortion is murder[comment]So you should kill the child just because of the dad?
[comment]Wait[comment]Does the way conception occurs decrease the value of the life?
[comment]Why would we allow them for rape and incest anyways? What specifically about rape and incest make a baby worth less than if they were born out of normal sexual relations. To me it is hypocritical that some who can call themselves prolife are fine with killing babies who were conceived through rape and incest.
[comment]I've always thought about the abortion debate with the following logic game:

Can we first agree that there is \*real\* scientific debate over when exactly life begins? As in
That only leads us to one of two possible scenarios of legal and widespread abortion:

Either millions of "potential" lives are cut off for a myriad of reasons up to and including pure convenience of the "mother". 

OR  
We are allowing mass genocide in numbers that are unfathomable.

Seems like an easy exercise in figuring out which side you should err on.
[comment]I don't think a blanket law should be applied here. Should be case by case. Should it be used as birth control? No. The fetus isn't developing properly and likely won't survive birth and if it does it would be severely challenged with hardly any quality of life or risk the life of the mother or some other medical hang ups that may occur. Those are things that should be considered. They might already be I don't know. But an outright ban isn't the answer.
[comment]Rape and incest only contributes to 2% of committed abortions[comment]You know if we increased sex ed and contraceptive funding we would actually cut down on abortions needed for accidental pregnancies but \[y'all ain't interested in that]([https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump))

[comment]I would have voted for a condoleezza rice and she is a black female and I'm a white male. To be honest I probably would have voted for her over Donald Trump at first. Knowing now what I know I'm glad she didn't run against him cause I'm not sure if we would've ever gotten another shot with trump.
[comment]I bet she’s a certified yoga instructor.
[comment]How about I want to vote for the most qualified person regardless of their phallic status?
[comment]Present me with a woman running for President that has a platform I agree with[comment]over half of democratic voters are women.
[comment]Put up a woman worth voting for.
[comment]I gave money to Carly Fiorina's campaign because I thought she was smart and I liked her philosophy[comment]Of course the left will blame men. Because some women are apparently not yet advanced enough to admit our own screw ups and say "I couldn't get it done." We're only advanced enough to blame men. Will it ever occur to pathological lying sociopath Warren Out that her constant lies did her in.
[comment]I would vote for a black 40 year old woman who is a Republican then a 75 year old white guy democrat.
[comment]We elect someone based on the content of their character not the composition of their chromosomes.
[comment]But I thought democrats were all inclusive and equality supporting? How dare they not support a woman!
[comment]Refused to vote for a pathological liar?  Must be sexism.
[comment]I'll gladly vote for a SMART women for president. There are plenty of business women out there that I think could do a good job. Warren just is dumb and not for the American people.
[comment]I’m not gonna vote for someone whos an idiot and has terrible ideas just cause they’re a woman. So no[comment]I agree.  Men are to blame.  

I can’t be her amazingly low turnout.  Or her history of being the worst kind of race pimp.  Or the blatant dirty tricks she used openly on people like on Sanders.  Or her profound fakeness.  Her willingness to lie about literally anything.

It was men.

*-No[comment]She's about 50% right.
[comment]A woman won the popular vote in 2016 tf you on about
[comment]It's easier to blame a group for an alleged wrongdoing rather than focus on an ineffective clown
[comment]„Why should a woman settle for a number 2 job? " Because she wasn't good enough for number 1? Why would we choose the most important person in the world for four years based on gender? That's so stupid
[comment]Good lord ok ima day it( coming from a woman here) I don’t want a woman president if she isn’t good. Not only is that bad for our country[comment]There will never be a time on this earth that I would ever listen to even one thing this man-hating[comment]Well[comment]But men are to blame! Blame Joe and Bernie for getting more votes.
[comment]Warren didn't win because progressives arent a big voting group[comment]Lying Pocahonkie is to blame.
[comment]Serious question in what way was she different then bernie? I mean besides being a woman and *1/5000 native american* 



(Obvious sarcasm for the indian claim)

[comment]It's sad that that is a surprising relief to hear coming from a Police Chief in the US. Very few seem to actually give two shits about their communities
[comment]California is a cesspool
[comment]I live here. I bet he’s forced to qualify that statement later in the interview.
[comment]Good for him.
[comment]California doesn't deserve him.
[comment]I'm sure progressive left in San Jose will be frothing at the mouth to remove him because he isn't on board with permanent lockdown/civil rights forfeiture.
[comment]Smart man
[comment]Yup lol had my 18th birthday in quarantine.
[comment]Good for him. I wish he'd come out and say that he won't enforce these orders though.
[comment]Serious question: why is this a Republican v Democrat issue? 
This whole lock down vs not thing seems more like an Authoritarian v Libertarian thing to me.
[comment]This is what we miss in California and what we need more of. But when this shows up in the r/politics sub[comment]Reposting my comment from the /r/conservative post of this same video:

&gt; Just a reminder that not all California is "California." We might have more registered democrats than any other state (about 8.5M 
&gt; Texas may be the only state with more republican voters but the data I pulled from says Texas doesn't register by party so I don't know what they actually have.

&gt; Just saying not to write all of us off. I'd say at least half of our counties are solidly republican. A lot of them may have smaller populations but they're there.

&gt; We also have more independents than any other state

[comment]They should just call off the order and let the people who don't want to believe it go outside. If they get sick and or die then that's their choice but what's going on now is just ridiculous.

Do what you can to not restrict the rights of citizens while keeping the leftists in check.

[title]It’s Time To Stop Pretending Twitter Is A Neutral Platform
[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/28/its-time-to-stop-pretending-twitter-is-neutral/[comment]I didnt know anyone was! Neutral twitter is like saying reddit is... Laughable.
[comment]I mean.. it is a publicly traded company[comment]Use another platform. It’s a free country.
[comment]Twitter is a voluntary platform[comment]It's a public company[comment]I don’t think it’s a question of neutrality either.

Twitter is calling people out on their obvious bullshit now and let’s face it
Also this executive is constantly going back to make corrections to what he said. Folks still want reliable info.
[comment]It’s a private company. But let’s not let that stop us from supporting this idiotic EO.

Why is everyone surprised that the most high-profile user got flagged but tons of small users who say stupid things aren’t being censored? Gee[comment]The commenters in this thread who dislike the Executive Order need to read up about Platforms vs Publishers and read how the Order did not do anything  
It doesnt matter if you are a private company. Newpapers who are private companies dont get to publish anything they want either.
[comment]In my opinion It is waaaaay more neutral than reddit but less than facebook.
[comment]Everyone already knew Twitter is a dumpster fire[comment]I'm conflicted about this. Yes[comment]The fact theyve allowed him to stay on the platform spewing hate and false information for all these years shows they really arent leaning left like all yall suddenly seem to think.
They censored a tweet from the POTUS talking about shooting americans. They left his “only good democrat is a dead democrat” tweet alone though. He lost the popular vote so what he thinks over half of the voting population should be killed? What a joke of a country lmao
[comment]I never did pretend is was a neutral platform...

Who ever did? Who still is?

And neither is Reddit. It's as far left as you can get.
[comment]It's time to stop pretending any platform is neutral.
[comment]Yea let’s focus on the pandemic and record unemployment.
[comment]social media is a failed experiment in humanity
[comment]Time to stop pretending  reddit and all of social media are neutral.  I'm starting to think all of social media is a cancer on the planet for healthy societies
[comment]Everyone knows Twitter blows.
[comment]Nothing is a neutral platform anymore. I only see one side of the news on Reddit[comment]...ALL social media platforms ! Not just Twitter
[comment]Losing CDA 230 immunity and federal advertising revenue will hurt. Hope the Board is ready for shareholder lawsuits.
[comment]I'm very hesitant to tread down this path. Anybody notice the stickied comment on every post in this sub?

&gt; /r/Republican is a partisan subreddit

The government pulling platform status is dangerous for everybody. We can be mad that lots of people use twitter and point out twitter is often wrong but once you pull out the dinner table cloth there's no easy way of putting it back
[comment]When I joined the various social platforms I had the expectation of neutrality.
[comment]I made a comment on some lefty site to that effect and got pummeled with down votes. 
Convinced Reddit is controlled by communist China/looney left.

...and to answer the naysayer’sWhen you inject yourself as an arbiter of content[comment]This is so good. What you guys have to do to make things like this sound something near normal. House is under fire but hey[comment]When did we start?
[comment]At least i can see others ferrets here.
Twatter is the biggest joke. I was booted for a week for saying all pedos should hang. 

You would think they wouldn't be against that.
[comment]So Twitter is a little biased so let’s start a bill to try to take it down?
[comment]Why have republicans suddenly decided they hate the concept of private property? Feckless communists. Y'all are the same as democrats now. Ridiculous.
[comment]Well I mean it is a private company so they can swing whichever way they want. Zuck criticised what they did but his company is also private so they’re both entitled to doing things in different ways
[comment]Twitter is trash
[comment]Never once did I think it was neutral. It’s a cesspool for SJWs.
[comment]It sucks man. Jack forces me against my will and MAKES me use twitter instead of the other dozen social media sites. FUCK HIM

[title]If Democrats nominate Bernie Sanders[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/if-democrats-nominate-bernie-sanders-they-hand-the-election-to-trump[comment]Don't know about that. I'd vote for Bernie over Trump.
[comment]Disagree.

I think Bernie
The DNC hates him so he's doing something right lol
[comment]Bernie would absolutely tank the economy so Wall Street would get behind Trump. Trump will easily beat him. 




Bernie is a self admitted socialist[comment]I remember during the West Virginia primaries in 2016 news stations were asking people who they supported. People were supporting Bernie. When asked who they planned on voting for if Bernie didn’t get the nomination they answered with Trump.
[comment]If Bernie is nominated trump is in big trouble imo. Anyone else and he easily wins
[comment]Bernie will destroy Trump if Trump doesn't destroy himself first.
[comment]Bernie is the only one who recognizes the dangers of climate change. Elect anyone else and New York will probably go underwater within 20 years. Gives a whole new meaning to Wall Street is sinking
[comment]Tbf if they nominate Biden[comment]It's funny because over to the other side[comment]If they nominate anyone other than Joe Biden[comment]People with big money dont want Bernard to tank the economy
Imagine telling a bunch of very rich and powerful people who either directly or by proxy employee millions that they will make a lot less money forever until the Socialism BS is out in total. "hey[comment]I honestly believe the only person who can beat Trump is Michelle and even that will be a close one. Even then..VOTE
[comment]Holy Bernie brigade!
[comment]I don’t know[comment]It’s important to point out that every democrat said Trump had no chance of beating Hillary[comment]I think Biden is the only serious candidate. The rest of the communists are just to far to the left.
[comment]Never take that for granted though. No one thought Trump could ever beat Hillary.
[comment]If they nominate Bernie[comment]Bernie is 5 bridges too far
[comment]If you happen to see my F150 and it has a Trump sticker and a Bernie Sanders sticker[comment]I disagree. I think Sanders will be trouble for Trump bec he speaks the same language of appeasing workers and bringing back jobs. Also[comment]If any Democrat faces Trump it's an easy Trump landslide. Biden is corrupt and senile. Talking about kids rubbing his hairy legs at the pool. Warren is full of crap[comment]There’s only one logical thing to do then! Republican Party should back Bernie to ensure Trump’s success!
[comment]Trump’s winning regardless of Democrat at this point.
[comment]I respectfully disagree with the title.  It should be replaced with "If Democrats nominate anyone [comment]I believe the election is a bit too far to make such a claim.
[comment]I can't see Bernie getting the nod. I have a feeling it will either be Biden or Warren. Trump would mop the floor with Bernie. Not to mention Obama has said Bernie is not a Democrat and that he would discourage voters from voting his way if it came to it. It also doesn't look good that he refuses to endorse his own former VP. Either way[comment]It’s going to be Bloomberg vs Trump
[comment]I’m afraid Sanders is the most formidable. Vermont is a fairly conservative state and he has won there for decades.
[comment]If they nominate Biden[comment]That would also make AOC the leader of the Democratic party. l doubt Pelosi and Schumer will let it happen.

Objectively he hasn't been calm and contained this presidency. He lashes out like...a lot.
[comment]I’m not sure why anyone would feel bad for Donald Trump.  The guy’s a billionaire
You know who I feel bad for?  My boss’s friend
You know who I don’t feel sorry for? Billionaire politicians who will be fine no matter what happens.  Feeling bad for people like that is like feeling sorry for Hollywood starlets because someone was mean to them on Twitter.  It comes with the territory.
[comment]Oh man[comment]Not just “being our leader”
I say that non-ironically.
[comment]I think he's a great leader. I don't like him as a person though. Seems like a jerk. But solid leader.
[comment]Democrats have gone completely crazy over Trump. Recently in r/politics[comment]Honestly I don’t know how that man can just wake up everyday and just be able to deal with all that hate he gets from the Media and the Do Nothing Democrats. Just imagine waking up every morning and thinking to yourself “There are MILLIONS of people who would love to have a public hanging of me or worse.” I don’t think some people realize how emotionally tough of a job being president is. Rather you like him or not[comment]Hes an accused rapist[comment]I voted for him in 2016 hoping he would be at least half as successful as he'd turned out to be. He has surpassed all my expectations. He gets criticized for many things
I didn’t vote for him to be my pastor
Do you think anyone aside from him would have been able to stand up to the left commie machine the way he had? Do you know of anyone who was running against him in the primaries on the right who could have taken the amount of abuse he’s been able to take? And through all of this he’s been kicking ass and taking names.

And nobody has been better at forcing the left to take off their masks and show themselves for the radical commies and swamp monsters they really are. Many democrat voters are waking up and seeing their own party for the swamp it’s become. And nobody but Trump could have pulled it off the way he had.

[comment]Personally I feel that's he's been less than calm. He often lashes out
And genuinely curious[comment]🤣
[comment]Trump is the worst Republican president we have had since Nixon. He isn’t a leader - he’s a bully. He tries to “will” things to be reality and is self centered and too concerned about his image.

I agree he has been unfairly bashed by the media and the demo-rats witch hunts have been wrong.

He isn’t anywhere near the leader Reagan or the Bushes were.
[comment]He's an "amazing leader" yet he spent the first two months of this crisis calling coronavirus a "democratic hoax" and assuring us everything was perfectly okay and that we should just live our normal lives. Now that shit has completely gone downhill[comment]I don’t know. This is his Churchill moment and he is blowing it. He should have more address the nation speeches where he gives status updates directly to the nation.
[comment]There seems to be an epidemic of assholes that are completely misguided by the media and our liberal higher ed system. Seems like most people are happy to accept what they hear without doing a little research on their own to find the truth. Sure Trump may not be the greatest guy you’d want to hang out with at the backyard BBQ[comment]He's a monster.
[comment]He isn't perfect[comment]The President's main issue is his mouth. It seems the older he's gotten[comment]I disagree. I don't think he's been doing a great job handling. There was a moment of two weeks where he was taking it seriously but words matter. There is countless evidence that he originally claimed to not believe in the severity and has now as recently as yesterday blamed hospitals for hoarding. 

The amount of mixed information isn't good for maintaining unity with the public and my concern is that he holding his rallies via the the press briefings. Some said that "actions speak louder than words". Sure
Sure the economy is tanking but there are thousands to millions more people or tanking even harder. It feels like he never seems to get that.

[title]FACT CHECK: No[selftext]https://www.dailywire.com/news/fact-check-no-trump-did-not-tell-people-to-inject-themselves-with-disinfectant-or-drink-bleach?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=benshapiro[comment]I love this sort of story when it goes viral like this.  Today Trump even doubled down on it
Is this a policy issue?  Nope.  Do Republicans and Conservatives care about this sort of trivia?  Nope.  

But the liberal media will run wild with this[comment]Once again President Trump demonstrates how easy it is to distract a stupid chicken with a bug.  (Rural experience req'd. for full understanding)
[comment]UV light is used every day at our hospital to sanitize our N-95 masks. Trump is always right.
[comment]Liberalism is a sickness
[comment]I just got banned on r/facepalm for stating that same fact.  I’m so glad to be a subscriber here!!
[comment]Trump trolls the press again.
[comment]He clarified he was being sarcastic. Most people don’t get his sense of humor. He likes to work the fake news into a frenzy by suggesting idiotic proposals[comment]Does this really need to be said?
[comment]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122858/
[comment]But But But CNN deciphered Trump speak for me and they said we have to drink bleach because it cure the cancer.
[comment]CNN stated that trump the whole world in order to prevent Rona[comment]Even if he did and they believed him. Let them go. It’s for the best.
[comment]Crazy how many people are repeating that!

And I'll say "please provide the quote where he says that".

And they say
Here's what he said:

&gt;"And then I see the disinfectant
He doesn't suggest injecting bleach.

He ends with "let's talk to doctors".

Ugh.
[comment]OMG OK I WAS GONNA POST THIS HERE! But thank you!. My facebook post has been bombarded with fake news from people who more than likely heard it through word of mouth. So I had to watch the actual speech and never did he ever suggest that people inject themselves with lysol but that “they” the medical professional were looking into a type of disinfectant that could be injected to clear the virus. If people would do their own research and actually watch the announcement they would see that. Unless they have TDS! DJT2020!
[comment]I understand that he was referring to how the UV light is used as the disinfectant.

The reason for the craziness around his statement is how he stated them. He talked about the UV light and his fascination with it. Then paused as if he was going to start his briefing. 

Then he started in about the disinfectant. If he didn't pause or made a connection between the two it is easily understandable that his wording makes it seem like he was suggesting disinfectant products versus the disinfectant delivered by the UV light.
[comment]The lefts blind hatred for Trump is showing. Although it won't matter because He'll be president until 2024 so ( ︶︿︶)_╭∩╮them.
[comment]CNN has not told the truth in many years...they have their own warped opinions and assume everything.....but no truth
[comment]I’ve posted on a number of subreddits and as you can guess got severely downvoted but I don’t care. 

The only thing he said wrong is “inject”. The correct word would be “ingest” 
Ironically my medical partner sent me a link today unrelated to Trump asking if we should follow a new guideline. He sent a link related to betadine use in the nose
He never F’ing said to drink bleach or Lysol.  The liberal reddit mental gymnastics is mind boggling at times.
[comment]The people that had been telling others to drink bleach and wants to themselves is offended because a guy allegedly said to drink bleach when in reality he didn’t

🤔
[comment]Now time to lather myself in leftist tears
[comment]You know[comment]It's a good thing he clarified because Democrats don't understand 4D chess. If he didn't clarify you'd have all the Democrats trying to drink hand sanitizer.
[comment]This post deserves a silver. You’re welcome
[comment]Trump is the master troll. I’m glad he could hit them one more time through this lie fest of theirs.

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/r8odab059m141.jpg[comment]Ah yes[comment]It’s important to attribute these flaws to both parties. Despite one’s political leaning[comment]At this point it’s just become a blame game. Both sides have faults. Both sides have crooks. Both sides are far from perfect. Politics have changed and nowadays it’s more important to put blame and call out opponents rather than focus on making America a better place to live. If Democrats and Republicans put their heads together in a civilized manner with no cameras and no reality TV bullshit we would progress much further as a society.
[comment]Yeah
Look[comment]Blagojevich was impeached and imprisoned by a Democrat-led legislature in Illinois. Just wanted to put that out there.

I also don't see why we shouldn't hold Trump accountable for things we criticize the Democrats on. Running up the deficit
Judge not[comment]I am extremely disappointed with how “creepy and sexist” Joe Biden is. He’s as creepy and sexist as the most well behaved grandfather at thanksgiving dinner.
[comment]Weird sex? Oral sex is not weird.
[comment]Both sides[comment]Honestly during the last election[comment]Bluntly
Equal application of the law; it must apply to everyone equally. The fact that democrats are exempt from it remains a serious problem.

[comment]This comment on r/ShitPoliticsSays sums up pretty well whatever the left is doing

&gt;I've noticed that a lot on the left. You can always count on the following happen after the first action.

1st - Someone
2nd - The left freaks out. They get organized. The unions get involved. They start to protest
3rd - They dig up dirt on the person
4th - Then their talking heads will give interviews on all the TV
It always seems to follow the same pattern[comment]Bro Clinton got a blowjob[comment]Facts

[comment]What inappropriate stuff has Sanders done?
[comment]Used to work with one of Anthony wieners mistresses at a restaurant. She was a real nut job
[comment]And I'll of this makes DJT's behavior OK?   Dont think so.
[comment]r/T_D is leaking; President Trump mocked a disabled reporter and then defended the use of the hand gesture and the “hurrr I don’t recall” by saying he wasn’t mocking his physical disability he was just calling the guy a mental retard which is worse than mocking a physical disability. He’s a disgrace as President and the fact that democrats won’t hold their own accountable doesn’t change that.
[comment]Doesn't change that Trump IS inappropriate[comment]Just because other politicians committed crimes it doesn't make Trump less currupt. May they all get punishments proportional to their own crimes. Whataboutism is deflection.
[comment]Right[comment]Is this a leftist sub? Or just the users are all leftist?
[comment]Excellent
[comment]Why isnt Hunter Biden on this list.

Joe says he is the best son ever


- achieved getting a military waiver for a cocaine charge

- gained a very hard to get age waiver to get a direct commission to the Navy
- cheated on his wife of 20+ years with his brother's widow

- cheated on his brother's widow with some rando half his age and fathered an illegitimate child
- cheated on his dead brother's widow with a woman much younger....at least he married her.

Such a great man!

[comment]We as a party cannot excuse Trump’s behavior because Democrats have acted the same way.  We cannot defend his behavior[comment]I LOVE whataboutisms!
[comment]This logical fallacy is called the "tu quoque" argumentA smarter response would be to address and logically justify the claims of the criticisms.

[comment]The most glaring aspect of your message is the dubiousness of redirecting attention from one wrong to another.

Then
As a side point
Returning to my initial point
As for the accusation that Obama gave money to terrorists
And before any simpletons reply
Furthermore
What I do care about is that we have a president that works for America; we don't have that now.
[comment]Democrats accuse republicans of what they actually did. Sad thing is they democrats were the ones to cheat in the 2016 election and still lost
[comment]Hey genius
Drinking 3 peg of whiskey every day won't kill you. Drinking 120 pegs in one day will
[comment]Truly curious as to how bad behavior on one side equates to bad behavior on the other.  I know this is a nation with only 2 prominent parties[comment]My two cents here would be that it took a list of 8 individuals to draw comparison to a single individual.  I believe that there's enough information for a reasonable individual to find Trump guilty of several indecent (if not entirely illegal) acts. I would not expect or stand for anyone from the other side of the aisle to be treated differently.
[comment]That doesn't exactly make Trump not inappropriate. I lean right and I get that he's a moron...
[comment]8 people

in addition[comment]Quid pro quo is what joe Biden actually did with Ukraine. It was the Clinton foundation who collided in the 2016 election. It’s the democrats who aren’t following the constitution by following a proper impeachment procedures. They just don’t like trump so want him gone. Get over it you lost
[comment]It’s funny that you think any democrats legitimately support Biden.
[comment]So your defense to Trump being inappropriate is other people being inappropriate too? Two wrongs don't make a right in my book.

[comment]All hail God Emperor Trump!

Don junior for president in 2024!
[comment]I would hope our president would have more information than all these shitty news media outlets. They aren’t in charge of anything and that’s the issues with Trump getting his briefings from Fox.  We have to stop listening to these echo chambers and start looking at the facts before we act.
[comment]This is hillarious. Maybe the silver lining here is now that Trump is throwing Fox News under the bus[comment]I too was thinking the flu is worse for lethality but I guess the rona is a lot more contagious. I’m not afraid of the rona so long as we can get the economy rolling again a S a p 

I’m a lot slower to blame any single politician than the hysterical media though. There’s nothing trump could have done that they wouldn’t try to eat him alive over.

When Stalin was purging and starving his citizens the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Hitler was coming to power
Do you see the pattern here?

And today when looking at History looking back at events the Western media rewrites the truth and manufacturing fiction to deny reality and cover up the truth. 

The communist movement has been very busy very active (Wikipedia
Wall Street is the modern-day slave boat owners of old.  They have modernized slavery using the Chinese Communist Party as the plantation owner to provide the slave labour for their profits.  Instead of moving the slaves to the factories they simply moved all the factories out of Western Democracies to Communist China

[comment]Media reports what other people say and do. If you disagree with what other people say and do it is not the media that’s the problem. 

Blaming the messenger is obtuse.

Find an journalist that reports what happened without trying to tell you how to feel about it. That will improve your perspective and balance emotions. 

“Trump said this.”
Or
“Xi Jing ping did that” 

The end.

This kind of thing. The commentary that journalists allow themselves these days is detrimental.
[comment]Are we now letting media headlines decide on how a leader should govern a nation?  


I get that journalism has now been muddied but this should not be used as a shield to avoid people in power for being accountable for their inaction.

His plans make no real economic or practical sense once you go beyond a real base level.

[comment]Yang has literally devoted his career to solving problems that affect ordinary Americans and he’s continuing to do so in an even bigger way as a candidate for president. That’s not the profile of a so-called snake oil salesman.
[comment]&gt; "[Yang] predicts that in a few years
This is one of those progressive talking points which carries with it a planetarily sized load of irony. Democrats and many of the President's critics frequently denigrate him by telling us he's a fear-monger and that's how he gets by.

...yet almost the entirety of the Democrats' economic platform is anchored to the idea that society is operating under the looming threat of an unprecedented destruction of jobs. To quote Jeff Bezos: "...we are so unimaginative about what future jobs are going to look like and what they are going to be."

And just like how Henry Ford quipped that if he had asked what someone would've wanted to get around more quickly

Its basically a test on healthy ppl to see if this vaccine is safe

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm about to get sick

From watchin' my TV

Been checkin' out the news

Until my eyeballs fail to see

I mean to say that every day

Is just another rotten mess

And when it's gonna change
Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot...

I seen the cops out on the street

Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff

And chokin' in the heat

Listened to reports

About the whisky passin' 'round

Seen the smoke &amp; fire

And the market burnin' down

Watched while everybody

On his street would take a turn

To stomp and smash and bash and crash

And slash and bust and burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Well you can cool it
You can heat it...

'Cause
Take your TV tube and eat it

'N all that phony stuff on sports

'N all the unconfirmed reports

You know I watched that rotten box

Until my head began to hurt

From checkin' out the way

The newsmen say they get the dirt

Before the guys on channel so-and-so

And further they assert

That any show they'll interrupt

To bring you news if it comes up

They say that if the place blows up

They'll be the first to tell

Because the boys they got downtown

Are workin' hard and doin' swell
And if anybody gets the news

Before it hits the street
They say that no one blabs it faster

Their coverage can't be beat

And if another woman driver

Gets machine-gunned from her seat

They'll send some joker with a brownie

And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Hey you know something people

I'm not black

But there's a whole lots a times

I wish I could say I'm not white

Well
And the local people turnin'

On the merchants and the shops

Who used to sell their brooms and mops

And every other household item

Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em

And they say it served 'em right

Because a few of them are white
And it's the same across the nation

Black &amp; white discrimination

They're yellin' "; You can't understand me!";

And all the other crap they hand me

In the papers and TV

'N all that mass stupidity

That seems to grow more every day

Each time you hear some nitwit say

He wants to go and do you in

Because the color of your skin

Just don't appeal to him

(No matter if it's black or white)

Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we gotta sit around at home

And watch this thing begin

But I bet there won't be many left

To see it really end

'Cause the fire in the street

Ain't like the fire in my heart

And in the eyes of all these people

Don't you know that this could start

On any street in any town

In any state if any clown

Decides that now's the time to fight

For some ideal he thinks is right

And if a million more agree

There ain't no great society

As it applies to you and me

Our country isn't free

And the law refuses to see

If all that you can ever be

Is just a lousy janitor

Unless your uncle owns a store

You know that five in every four

Just one amount and nothin' more

Don't watch the rats go across the floor

And make up songs about being poor

Blow you harmonica son!
[comment]No. Please.  Stop.
[comment]Something people need to be aware of is that rioters don't care about Floyd or any other victim of police brutality.  They don't care about race or injustices or inequality.  They are violent criminals who just look for an excuse to vandalize and do violence.  Rioters simply want to riot
Do no let these idiots ever convince you that they give a damn about human life[comment]CNN wanted a riot and pushed for a riot only thing is CNN wanted somebody else to be targeted.
[comment]What would make them target CNN? They seek "truth" from them. Did they side with the former officer or something?

[comment]"Peaceful protests[comment]Incite racial wars and hysteria. It just might end up biting you in the ass. I just love cnn is acknowledging it happened. But calling it protests. The moment a protest crosses the threshold of violence or destruction. It’s not a protest. MLK god rest his soul is rolling in his grave.

Yes!  It’s real!
[comment]This is all a distraction to fill up the news cycles and take time and all eyes away from the fact that the Obama administration is going to get in big trouble for spying.  This is all predictable!
[comment]Not satire?
[comment]Karma’s a bitch[comment]These Democrat animals they dont care about justice they just want to riot and destroy things
[comment]They have started here in Richmond[comment]It amuses me all the people posting about how peaceful protest haven't changed anything. Which is why they're rioting now.

has violent riots ever change the hearts of people so they don't hate anymore?

the only thing that will stop racism is time and people changing. 

And the only thing that'll change police involved shootings. Is less crime so the police don't feel the need to reach for their guns so fast.

[comment]What really sent a chill for me was that NO ONE laughed at this... she seems to have been taken completely seriously and was only hushed up after she refused to yield her time. Not a reassuring number of people looking shocked or freaked out by this... the left is freaking crazy and very scary..
[comment]Omg wtf.
[comment]Don’t give them any ideas[comment]This is just a little too on the nose. I feel like this lady might actually be making fun of climate alarmists

[comment]Why does anyone post anything she says?

She is a bubble headed wind bag who can be ignored
[comment]this is some deep thinking chess moves from the far left

1. promote ignorance of COVID contagiousness thus increasing the amount infected

2. MSM flip rhetoric with hyper fear over disease

3. state POTUS was wrong not MSM for lack of immediate and complete solution to problem

4. instill division through race relations by connecting disease to racism 

5. make POC so scared they dont seek treatment thus adding to death toll

6. added death toll supports claim that the POTUS is racist

if it wasnt so stupid it would be brilliant[comment]Smooth brain takes are nothing new for AOC but I don’t see how even if that is true[comment]First Internet Troll elected to Congress.  It’s really sad that such a marginal person could have a seat in The House of Representatives.

[comment]I an sorry but is this a place for honest thoughtful discussion of our party and our values or is this just a place for parroting the nonsense that makes us forget the value of critical thinking? I for one do not equate Trumpism with Republican values or conservatism and I think maybe we’d be better off running somebody other than him.

5.Close down nuclear power plants.
6."Assault weapon" ban.

2.Stoping the spying of the US government on it's citizens.
3.Ending the war on drugs.

Yet you are allowed to change your gender at the age of 7?! 

Insane! 
You shouldn't be allowed to do shit until your 18 because you are a KID figuring life out.

[comment]Absolutely
[comment]Why stop there? Lets let them drink[comment]I always look at articles I read from the right and the left with scrutiny.

[comment]What if private charity isn’t enough to sustain people like the disabled or orphans or the severely mentally ill?
[comment]10-4
[comment]All people getting government assistance should be required to do something for the public. Even people on disability can do something. Theres a girl with down syndrome who bags groceries at my local store. Meanwhile my lazy ass mother in law gets a check because she ate so many twinkies that she requires a scooter to get around. I say she can shove a damn scooter with that cart.

[comment]What has that got to do with welfare?
[comment]What happens to the illegal alien who spends 20 to 30 years working under the table then because of health issues no longer can work? In one case that I know of he married a citizen and had 2 sons. What happens eventually when he can't work? Or have serious health issues?
[comment]Public charge is the law[comment]Yeah I agree
[comment]Any illegal can get a fraudulent social security number.
[comment]Immigrants shouldnt be here at all
[comment]Nobody should be one welfare! Conservatives need to understand this. It incentives poor decision making while penalizing responsibility.
[comment]correction illegal but legal tax paying law abiding immigrants in need should have the right to it
[comment]Neither should banks &amp; corporations
[comment]Bold statement for someone within milkshaking distance. Btw just a joke.
[comment]ITT: just...a lot of racism
[comment]Well I pay my taxes and I know why society is better for it. I if lawmakers would value human life over being afraid of immigrants and he poor then we might actually move forward as human beings.
[comment]I agree. Immigrants(especially illegal immigrants) that aren’t U.S. citizens yet should be on social welfare unless it is left/death situation.

[comment]Brb[comment]But he didnt die did he?
[comment]Pigs don’t care what color you are[comment]It's a very disturbing article. Good police are invaluable
But a single video to prove a point about race is misleading. The best study I've seen on the topic is here:

*An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force*

TLDR
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On non-lethal uses of force[comment]So are we going to be having race wars every summer before a presidential election now[comment]But which ones burn down cities every election year?
[comment]Ok so let's do something about cops killing our citizens of all races.
[comment]Yeah
&amp;#x200B;

Looks like Novembers going to be a breeze.
[comment]Yeah[comment]You're statistically more likely to be killed by a cop if you're white than if you're black. This whole "it's open season on blacks for cops" is such bullshit and it's blatantly obvious
[comment]Wow and no riots[comment]Expect whites down burn down entire cities when it happens
[comment]The problem is far bigger than just race. Race is the excuse many of these dirtbags use to hide their culpability.

Remind me again[comment]Its not just black people protesting. I really hope people see that.
[comment]Only in this case there were no riots. No reportage. No looting. No protests. No nothing. Why? Because he was white. I am sick and fuckin tired of the Caucasian race being trampled on or fought against or ignored. If we’re all to coexist peacefully together then all lives matter[comment]Nothing new. So what about the tens of thousands of innocent people murdered annually due to gang violence? That's ok right? That doesn't deserve any reaction or critical attention? More people lose their life prematurely due to gang violence than police brutality could ever touch. And this has been a trend for decades. 

I know people will want a source so this is statistical value for one location in one year. Long story short. 700+ murdered
https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-homicides-data-tracker-htmlstory.html

Downvote all you like[comment]To be fair cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by cocaine and the stress of the altercation. Cops need to be retrained.
[comment]Wife was up late with me last night/this morning
White people are expected to die and be forgotten.
That's why these things come and go.

Until we start doing the same shit
That[comment]So my question is[comment]An attack on one group of citizens is an attack on all of us. It doesn’t matter who is suffering unjustly. If there is unjust suffering then it needs to be taken care of. We had wars about this
Don’t let anyone divide us !
[comment]Privatize law enforcement along with everything else.
[comment]We can now deduce that cops have no regard for human life
[comment]Do you guys remember when we rioted in the streets after Tony Timpa’s death? Yeah[comment]I find it very telling that this is posted on r/republican and also reposted from r/libertarian
[comment]Police brutality is a real thing[comment]This is not a movement about black lives mattering more. 

Black lives matter *enough* to address the lethal culture creeping through law enforcement unchecked. 

There are a few bad cops that abuse their power and are acting as judge
I don’t agree with looting and burning and violence. But I completely agree with the protests and the messaging. 

There are good cops but they failed to reform a system that is killing people.
[comment]Go on and try the solidarity approach.

[comment]this is the reach of the century. If you wanna go outside and die from covid go ahead bro.
[comment]Millions of American veterans have willingly sacrificed life and limb to protect the lives of their fellow citizens.

And then there are these people.

I think it is reasonable to take economic hardships and mental health into consideration
It is not reasonable to recklessly endanger the lives of your fellow citizens.

It is patriotic to engage in social distancing for the sake of your fellow Americans. Everyone who CAN make sacrifices should make them without complaint.
[comment]Some people just want an excuse to dress in public like their in special forces.

I’m a veteran and I can’t stand all these pretenders who think putting on their tacticool gear makes them some kind of hero.

[comment]Wow. Some people are really stupid? I am glad these idiots are all gathering together during this pandemic and protesting.

[comment]Going out with rifles to protest the governor(s) telling you to stay home unless it’s absolutely necessary to combat the spread of a disease that might kill you/you might unknowingly spread to someone else doesn’t make you look patriotic[comment]And there it is.

[comment]You know they did quarantines back in Jefferson’s day
This is not 1984
Seriously
I’m not saying don’t open the economy. I said from day 1 that quarantines were unsustainable financially and would wreck the economy. I also said I didn’t think the death rate was anywhere near 3.4%. 

But the fact remains that it is highly contagious and overruns hospitals. Go look up what happened in Albany Ga. That’s what will happen if we do absolutely nothing. 

And my point is that there are many conservatives who advocating for exactly that - go back to the way it was before with zero precautions. That’s a very stupid mindset.

[comment]Sad but very true
[comment]Some good things / decisions that have happened..... Travel restrictions to China
I think US leadership is trying. I think Trump was trying to be hopeful and not panic or act rashly on information he couldn't verify or didn't trust. No one is perfect. 

However[comment]joe chiden

Silicon valley and big tech donate to Democrats

Democrats give favorable treatment and cover for China.

China invests in silicon valley and big tech....
[comment]Shouldn’t we be blaming Putin in that case?

"Democrats Would Rather Blame Trump Than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
[comment]It’s probably because they have ties to China
[comment]I would love to see Trump do and say the opposite of what he really wants. Just to see the Libs attack his view. Then say you know what[comment]They could have done much more sooner
[comment]The American people have very little control over China. We can point out the failings of Xi and his authoritarian regime but there is very little recourse for us. 

Trump is the head of the US government and his response has been poor. We as Americans have the ability to change our own government and therefore[comment]I identify myself as a democrat but seeing people blaming everything on Trump instead of recognising that China and WHO should take most of the responsibilities on the pandemic hurts my brain

I do not doubt this happens AT ALL. It is just surprising sometimes because I have mayyyyyybe met 1 or 2 people that were this zealous in their political beliefs to take things that far.

I might not agree with evething on the right but at least they are not bat shit crazy like the left

We’ll beat them again and they’ll still be screaming into the sky and petting their baby llamas[comment]I keep a very low profile in SoCal.

[comment]I was talking with a girl and we were going to meet soon.  Everything was going so well and I liked her. I knew she was a Liberal
She made a comment about how she hoped the dems could impeach trump and referenced Ukraine so I brought up Uncle Joe.  

She confirmed I was Republican and said "I don't associate with Trump supporters."  

I don't understand the people who live in their bubble and avoid people who arent Liberal.   It blows my mind.
[comment]It's all good. Just pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
[comment]Move man
[comment]I am sorry to hear about the treatment you and your family are receiving. Stay safe! If people bring it up I always throw out the law of the 3 unmentionable topics in public. No talk of sex[comment]this is genuinely gut wrenching
[comment]I'm personally a Democrat[comment]Its crazy!!!! A guy I met here basically thinks this way. If you support trump you're a racist... it's like what?! I really want to move out when I can! Maybe to a swing state and help flip it Red just because..

[comment]A majority of the riots are happening in heavy liberal cities. I'll never understand why they blame Republicans and conservative for the racism when so many of these incidents happen in their own backyards.

[comment]Got that right my state of commie Cal is about as corrupt and lawless as they come thanks to the Democrats. I live just North of Fresno Cal a few years ago the second in command at the Fresno PD was a Black man who was arrested and charged with drug running. Fresno is a major drug distribution hub for the Mexican mafia for California. The illegal alien gangs in Fresno run rampant. When I first moved here it was common to read in the Fresno newspaper about dead burnt bodies being found in farm fields at least twice a week.
[comment]I mean yes to this post but our President also decided to throw fuel on this fire and then proceed to do literally nothing.

[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-rogan-id-rather-vote-for-trump-than-biden[comment]We agree Rogan. Trump isn’t perfect but Biden would be a disaster and ultimately you would be voting for his VP to take over as president as he’s not even mentally fit now let alone in 2021 and beyond.
[comment]Joe Rogan also would rather vote for Bernie Sanders
[comment]It’s an easy decision for most of us.  I’ve always been on the fence between left and right.. I doubt I’ll ever vote again after these last 4 years. They really are some crazy mofos[comment]The Democrat party is not equipped to rule America. There are fundamental flaws in the system that they used in picking their candidate. Remember how the Iowa primary was a complete clusterfuck?
[comment]Rogan is an idiot. He knows nothing about politics and wavers every time he brings on a guest that gets him hard. Dudes just playing the game.
[comment]He might have actually grown a brain.
[comment]Joe was going to respond to this[comment]Shhhh[comment]Finally[comment]I thought I felt an earthquake yesterday... Now I know what was it. Boom!

[comment]either way i’m not a fan of him and have never been
[comment]Hes still stupid for thinking Bernie Sanders is a good candidate
[comment]That isn’t really saying much. Anyone with a brain can see Biden is out to lunch mentally
[comment]I think I figured out why sleepy Joe seems so off; the DNC had to scoop out part of his brains to install the remote control.

[selftext]https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/08/elizabeth-warren-confirms-medicare-all-plan-cover-illegal-immigrants/[comment]They've all already committed to this - no news here.
[comment]She is so isolated from reality that she actually thinks this is a winning strategy.
[comment]She must be smokin that peace pipe cuz thats gonna cost a lot of wampam.
[comment]Smh. Crazy woman...
[comment]Can just imagine everyone in the world flying in for surgeries. Never heard of such a ridiculous thing even in counties with socialized medicine!
[comment]We’re paying for their medical coverage regardless.  Complaining is stupid.  Come up with solutions.
[comment]Even some of my Democrat friends don’t agree with healthcare for illegals. I’d say it’s split 50/50. About half think they should have[comment]She has no interest in winning does she?
[comment]Here is how it will go down if they cover illegals

1.) Democrats believe in open borders.
2.) Instead of paying for expensive treatments themselves3.) All thru the border state4.) Once treated and healthy5.) The tax payers are played for a fool.
[comment]No.
[comment]What I don't get is why their own country won't cover them[comment]Sit the fuck down[comment]Her plans will bankrupt this nation and we will end up in a depression
[comment]Congratulations[comment]I don't think any of y'all understand that if we don't start taking care of our people[comment]It’s like the UK NHS [comment]Hey you could very well be right and I respect that you have a strong opinion on this. And I am not trying to change your mind on either subject for it is clear your opinion has been formed. But here are my final thoughts for the sake of having a respectful disagreement. 

Re: border - While some far-left dems believe in open borders
Re: Healthcare - The “people could take advantage of this” argument is fair
You may be right in the end and I am open to that. But I am not going to rush to any decision without respectfully listening to both sides.
[comment]This is all racial politics. If the people sneaking in we're White and we're generally conservative-minded oh[comment]It's like a reverse auction with the left. How much $$ can we GIVE away?

[title]Hedge fund manager predicts huge market sell-off if a 'socialist' wins in 2020
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hedge-fund-manager-predicts-huge-market-sell-off-if-a-socialist-wins-in-2020[comment]First of all[comment]&gt;  I gained insight into how far to the right both the Democratic and Republican parties were 

This is a quote I took form a socialist forum literally 30 seconds ago. God forbid you voice your opinion here too you'll be called a racist alt-right whatever. These people are crazy. If they love socialism overseas so much
 My take on this is *if* a socialist were to win[comment]So just buy up the fallen stocks and make bank.
[comment]Socialists≠Economics
[comment]I’m assuming those would equate to “limited” government involvement in the economy
[comment]Trump will won in 2020 but we will probably get a Democrat in 2024. At that point it will be time to pull your money out of the stock market. I plan to pull mine at ~6 months before the election and wait until we go into a recession[comment]Ya bud. Let me know when anyone who’s under 50 right now sees their social security money. Because it’s never going to happen.
[comment]This happens EVERY. SINGLE. ELECTION. This is not news or even remotely true. There will be no "sell off" this is scare tactics by the rich which should surprise no one.
[comment]If Warren won (hahahahah) hell I could see her sending feds to your house to check under your mattress for money.
[comment]Does anyone know how to look at a graph?

Look at a 10 year graph of the DJIA...
[comment]Bullshit.

[comment]Don’t call it a gun buyback. I didn’t buy my firearms from the government. I bought them from FFLs and private party. The government isn’t paying me for my guns. They’re raising my taxes[comment]So many people are actually going to die from this....Civil war inbound!

Even /r/Texas which is uber liberal has abandoned him as a lunatic loser.
[comment]Anyone who would run on such a policy proposal is just out of touch with mainstream America[comment]This commie is just the worst.
[comment]Why do people even buy this crap? Politicians do this nonsense all the time before they’re elected. They lie.

So
No.
[comment]Can we just let these people hold a microphone and keep them talking?
[comment]No way beto is this stupid[comment]No[comment]Beto is just digging hard into this narrative and I will be quite surprised if he ever holds office again in Texas. I think we should all take this as a blessing as it also looks bad for the rest of the Democratic party.
[comment]He looks like one of those people who need a nice hard slap across the face

[comment]THERE WAS A FIRE FIGHT!!!!!
[comment]Beta is out of the race anyways
[comment]Why are we even bothering to give this guy attention? He’s polling at under 2% and just throwing Hail Marys to the craziest of lefties. Let him die in obscurity.
[comment]I can't believe that Donald Trump was being accused of trying to incite a civil war.

Beto's plan would literally result in civil bloodshed.

Molon labe.

[comment]I’m surprised trump hasn’t put an end to money towards PP[comment]this isn't new--they've been spending money on politics and elections for years. They do it through their Super Pac. it's legal because they do it through the super pac and other 501c4 entities
[comment]It's legal because there are distinct[comment]Isn't this kind of argument a logical fallacy? This would be the same if the Feds gave money to a teacher's unions or a nonprofit that helps to feed the hungry and they then use donations they get (not the money the feds give them) to help fund elections to support candidates that would help support them to get even more funding for teachers or food banks?   


Also[comment]We did it...its simple. Citizens United made A merica political donation crack heads...
[comment]What’s twitchy?
[comment]Wait that sounds like Corp money in politics.
[comment]Better than spending it on killing babies.
[comment]That’s called lobbying[comment]Convincing your political party to off their kids sounds like a great way to get rid of your political party.
[comment]1. What's the difference between a non-profit organization like Planned Parenthood providing financial and other forms of endorsements into politics and a church/religious organization that will lose their non-profit status if they state the name of their preferred candidate from the pulpit? 
2. Any organization[comment]OP I completely agree with you but you were asking for the resistance by putting the name of the Abortion Factory in the title. The place Democrats created to keep poor black communities from expanding (it’s true
Anyhow
Go back to r/chapotraphouse [comment]If they can donate to a political party they don't need government help.
[comment]It shouldn’t be legal[comment]Planned parenthood should be defunded and everyone there should be thrown out to live on the streets. 

Abortion is wrong. And benefiting financially from abortion is even worse. Using that money to influence the political outcome of an election is just sickening. Burn it all down.
[comment]If i ever ran for office as a Republican I would spend all my time talking about abortion while waving a gun on stage and I would probably get elected.
[comment]I’m asking this because I genuinely don’t know. Isn’t this basically what the NRA does? Both organizations have a separate entity that operates from private donations that they use for political purposes[comment]It's about to get even more legal if Trump and the GOP get rid of the Johnson Amendment which keeps 501c3 organizations from directly or indirectly intervening amd participating in in any political campaign.

[comment]I seriously can’t believe Elizabeth Warren wants to divert funding for the “racist” wall to fight the coronavirus. How exactly does an open border policy help contain and control the outbreak???
[comment]These same idiots defended Obama when he refused to ban flights from Liberia during the Ebola outbreak.
[comment]Liberals are scum.
[comment]Yeah I don't know about that. M4A and paid time off for all would definitely help in this situation.
[comment]Is this a parity article?  No one thinks people want this thing to get out of control for political reasons.  Maybe the whitehouse is trying to get ahead of this by sending out this propaganda?
[comment]What exactly were the lies? Who knows what this could become. People just want it taken seriously. I think trump's initial downplay of coronavirus was to try to keep people and the markets from overreacting. 

But the fact that I saw people denying this is even a threat to try to make libs look stupid is probably the stupidest thing I have seen in a while. Fuck politics let's just pray it doesnt get out of control more than it has.
[comment]I feel like coronavirus is a punishment for all Trump's sins.
[comment]Trump is attempting to cut funding from the CDC[comment]It should tell you how evil at their very core the left is.  They will legitimately work as hard as they can to see people suffer or die just to achieve the tiniest political victories.

#  What's True

The Trump administration's proposed 2021 budget includes cuts to the CDC's activities related to chronic disease. (ED: This is not set in stone
 It is also true that in 2018 the Trump administration fired key officials connected to the U.S. pandemic response
# What's False

Congress hasn't approved the budget
# Regarding the disease

&gt; World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Tarik Jašarević recently [estimated](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic) the COVID-19’s R naught (the number of other people one sick person is likely to infect on average) is around 2–2.5
&amp;#x200B;

&gt; SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is thought to have [originated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738798) in a Chinese ‘wet market’. Although more deadly than COVID-19 – it has a [CFR of 14–15%](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) – most cases of human-to-human transmission [occurred in healthcare settings](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) and it only made its way to 26 different countries before being contained.  
   
Its [estimated R naught](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf) during the initial phase of the epidemic was 2.9
From  [https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html)

[selftext]https://politifeed.net/news/study-96-of-biologists-agree-life-begins-at-fertilization[comment]Yes it does
[comment]REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[comment]Life begins before fertilization. Both the egg and the sperm are living.

Are they sentient beings? No.
[comment]20 years ago[comment]The sad thing is that most know it’s starts at fertilization[comment]WOW 96% of scientists agree that climate change...oops...I mean...life begins at conception.
[comment]Here's the actual study.  Chapter 5 is the relevant section.  The questions asked start on page 240.  It's an interesting read.
https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/1883

What the headline alludes to is that 96% of respondents agreed with one or more of the following statements:

1. Implicit Statement: “The end product of mammalian fertilization is a fertilized egg (‘zygote’)2. Implicit Statement: “The development of a mammal begins with fertilization3. Implicit Statement: “A mammal's life begins at fertilization4. Explicit Statement: “In developmental biology5. Explicit Statement: “From a biological perspective
Statement 5 was the most contentious of these statements.  It was affirmed by 69% of respondents
85% of the respondents were pro-choice[comment]Here is the thing[comment]Keep your evangelical bs out of government it's the same shit as sharia law
[comment]So with your logic the day after pill is murder?  That’s an asinine statement.  Besides scientists all agree that life came from the Big Bang so does this mean we quote science only when it fits our narrative?
[comment]I am not a republican or even a conservative in the slightest[comment]When does life without the boot heel of a government agent begin?
[comment]I’m from the UK and just recently Northern Ireland have passed a law that makes it legal to have an abortion up to 28 weeks. That basically means that a baby that is touching 7 months old can now be legally aborted. I think that’s awful but there’s nothing you can do. You just have to accept it at this point because the progressives always get their way. I can understand the reasoning for abortion when the baby is in its very early stages but when it’s touching 7 months old I don’t see how you can justify it unless the baby or mother’s health is seriously compromised.
[comment]I'm ok[comment]Abortion is simply a selfish act in almost every case
An argument I see is that it isn’t the fathers choice because he doesn’t carry it for 9 months.  That’s BS
What if the father was okay with having another child? It’s his kid as well[comment]99% of biologists agree there ARE ONLY 2 FLAMING GENDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
[comment]People no longer give a shit because its not convenient. I remember having an argument with a dude who tried to make it an autonomy argument[comment]Here’s the big one I can’t understand:

Scientists are now doing the In Vitro Fertilization with genetic screening of embryos to choose the gender or likeliness to have blue eyes
Then just as ready to kill that amazing thing at 9 months. 

Scientists see the beginning of life amazing and see all the DNA code and unique information in each one. Work so hard to make life happen and then work so hard to make sure they can kill them just as easy.
[comment]x% of scientist say what the left wants about climate change
Just goes to prove one thing.  The left doesn't know anything about or care anything about actual science.  Don't ever let them tell you otherwise.

That's why he did it.
[comment]Trump doing what he accused Obama of possibly wanting to do[comment]I am a liberal and I think this was a good move by trump. The threat of force was also a good idea besides the cultural area attacks. It was actually one of the few days where I think he had a good day.

Brilliant.

[comment]Love it. 💘
[comment]Why didn't I think of that¿ 🤔
[comment]AWW I shouldve done that !! i had my 2020 flag up though[comment]God bless I thought her eyes were going to fall out with all the rolling they were doing
[comment]Perfect! Except I want to see those titties
[comment]Not me! I spent the whole time with my phone focused on her face taking pictures of all of the stank-tuary expressions she was making. The Memes will make them selves!
[comment]Epic!! Trump completely owned Nancy. I believe I heard him rip a nasty fart in her direction—nasty Nancy probably loved the taste of Digested McDonald’s
[comment]Much like an ostrich.
[comment]Your dad is smart[comment]What? Her reactions made it super entertaining!
[comment]Her ripping those documents at the end was so childish[comment]I wish I thought of that.
[comment]I watched it online so I could browse worthwhile endeavors all over her face.
[comment]I was hoping she would get a massive papercut when she ripped up his speech. She is a nasty woman.
[comment]I hope she crashes her broomstick on her way to hell
[comment]What a great SOTU. We sure have an amazing President. I loved the chanting 4 more years and USA!
[comment]What was she mouthing? I cant lipread
[comment]You guys live in a sad[comment]She behaved like her usual self.  Can't be happy for the American people because of her hatred of Trump.  Ripping up the speech was icing on the cake.
[comment]I cant believe she tore them up what a fool
[comment]Why couldnt I have thought of this?! This would have saved me so much aggrevation! My blood pressure last night was BOILING just watching the ignorance bleed from the right of the screen and the left side of the whole room. Truly a joke if I have ever seen one. All I can hope is that other americans can see whats right in front of them
[comment]I never knew Nancy Pelosi could look so good. This is brilliant. I'm definitely doing this next year. Wait what did I say. I want have to next year because the republicans are going to control the house and the senate and the presidency. Know anything will be CA nancy doing a sitting in the seat crying like a bit

[comment]I was pleased to watch her have to listen to all the accomplishments.  When Nancy is unhappy[comment]Your dad sucks hope he dies
[comment]Missed some fine comedy with her covered
[comment]Hahahaha!
[comment]The Democrats couldnt have looked more against the American people then last night. Not clapping/celebrating for the successes Americans are experiencing just because a democrat isn't president blows my mind
[comment]I for one am so glad she ripped up the speech at the end. Many people watching that will instinctively know it demonstrates unbridled hatred[comment]Unfortunately her rage filled face is now burned into the cloth[comment]Someone needs to tell peloski[comment]How was he able to see Nancy and her disgusting Baby Jane lipstick mutter drunkenly to herself
[comment]Hahahah I couldn’t stand viewing that vile creature! She will be impeached for destroying the state of union!
[comment]It’s funny watching her act like a spoiled brat
[comment]I should have done the same. She was so damn annoying to watch.

Latest Action:	Senate - 03/22/2020 Motion by Senator McConnell to reconsider the vote by which cloture on the motion to proceed to the measure was not invoked (Record Vote No. 77) entered in Senate.

This is the bill (47-47 vote) that was blocked in the senate. No reporter mentions or links the actual bill in their “article”.  Why is this a bill that is over a year old and only has to do with employer insuance tax relief?

Vote: 77 (47-47)

Rejected

On Cloture on the Motion to Proceed: Motion to Invoke Cloture: Re: Motion to Proceed to H.R. 748; A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage.
[comment]This just proves what alot of folks have been saying....the Dems don't care whether or not the country fails.  They just want rid of Trump.  There is no "dealing" with a group like this.  Failure plays into their hands and they can get a "socialist utopia" they dream of.
[comment]How are you so sure that the corporations who employ Americans will spend the money in our best interest? There is a clear argument against this bill saying that corporations can still still lay off employees while taking bailout money. It’s being called a slush fund because they are loose rules on how it’s spent. I’m wary of that sort of thing[comment]Democrats are f\*\*king a\*\*holes.
[comment]Sadness and more sadness as self-serving agendas take precedence over the wellbeing of the American people.  So many more will struggle and suffer as a result of this purely political chess move.
[comment]I can't believe people are not outraged that the democrats are stalling a bill that would help the people in our country. I hope the dem voters see that politicians hate for our president is stronger than their love for OUR country.

[comment]I actually cannot believe how petty the dems just acted. They dont get the spotlight so they shoot down a bill that will actually help millions of people? If you dont like it that much then maybe make another bill after this one is in so that we can help the goddamn people who cant work and pay for food and rent.this was absolutely childish of the democratic side of the Senate. I am incredibly disappointed.
[comment]Democrats high fiving each other at the prospect of damaging the US economy.

They are only there because its free and it's the next step.  It will just become high school 2.0.

Warren:

&gt; Warren has said she would pay for the plan
&gt; She even said she'd do so on her first day in the White House
&gt; she would act **without waiting for Congress** because the Secretary of Education can “use its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs.” (emp mine)

Am I in a weird timeline where we are currently watching the Senate snore through an impeachment process of a quite flimsy interpretation of what the president can or cannot do with foreign policy while a presidential candidate (who is currently sitting in judgement of her political rival) campaigns on violating the constitution "day 1"?

[comment]There's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. As far as college tuition. The answer isn't to lay the burden on tax otters to pay off other peoples school loans. The answer is to force colleges to charge fair tuition and lower it substantially.  One way to do it is for the government to limit the amount they lend for school loans. Cap it at $12k/year. Colleges will have to adjust or have empty classes. 
As far as Healthcare for all. It never works. We had a better system before Obamacare.  Everybody that worked had decent insurance through their employer. Though that didn't could go to various county hospitals that didn't charge. I live near Chicago. We have Cook County hospital. They provide service to anybody[comment]I am all for people getting healthcare and being able to afford college. But nothing in this world is free.

[comment]That is just sad. I can't even come up with anything more.
[comment]I dislike articles that misrepresent polls like this.

&gt;The poll asked 1

&gt;Among the middle
• Indiana University: Seems kinda silly to be proud about something I had zero control over.

• University of Houston: I’m glad to be an American
• Cal State San Marcos: America is the only country that matters.

• Notre Dame: Grateful? Yes. I don’t think pride is the correct emotion.

Much different than “republicans love America[comment]They should leave then.
[comment]Biased domain haha. That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. Breitbart is trash. This is an absurd article that probably wasn't even based off a real poll.
[comment]Well looking at our current president not surprised.  The negative stereotype on Americans is being dumb and lazy.  Well at least the former can be declared true.
[comment]I’m ashamed they’re Americans too.

[comment]I'm the son of immigrant parents and I love being american. I have visited both of my parents home countries (I'm asian) and would not trade places to live in either one. Even some of our crappiest universities are top 100 in the world (my school). That's a thing people never talk about. How unusual is it that the US has so many nationally renowned universities when most countries have only one or two. We lead in scientific discoveries and innovation.  Any industry you wish to work in it's hard to argue that the US is not a prime place to find a job for that industry. Some of the crappiest houses I've seen in the US is league's better than the crumbling unsafe houses I've seen visiting other countries. My dad worked his ass off and succeeded in the land of opportunity and is able to support all his relatives and my mothers back in their home countries. You are rewarded in the US for the amount of hard work you put in and I cannot say the same for other countries.
[comment]I'm shocked 25% of Republicans are not proud to be Americans
[comment]Why i'm not proud to be American: Lives in Australia
[comment]They were proud almost 3yrs and then they learned how democracy really worked.
[comment]They're traitors to their country
[comment]I have been to many countries in the last 20 years.

I always talk withfolks in bars and restaurants and in conferences and I can tell you that the opinions of foreigners have dramatically changed in the last few years.

The overwhelming majority of people I have talked to said two things about electing trump:

1. Have you all lost your minds? This was almost *every person I spoke with* when they realized I was American.

2. He isgoing to try to become a dictator and we *know* dictators. This was said in many different waysbutitall boiled down to the same set of words.

So no
We have a man in the white house who thinks he should be king. We have the world telling us we are out of our minds. 

How can anyone be "proud" of that???
[comment]Only 75%? Darn it’s lower than I thought. I need to speak to the soldiers.

[comment]Happening in the states too with these anti Semitic nutjobs in congress.
[comment]Who were the people? Who thought importing all the necessary hateful parts and poison pieces of the Middle East's wars and rumors of war and civil conflict turn out with anything other than burnt cathedrals[comment]Ah shit[comment]Wow I wonder who is responsible for that
[comment]Before you lecture the world you know. . .
[comment]I think it's time to take a page from the play book of the Jews and start compiling crimes against Whites.
[comment]Well then[comment]WW2 Part II?
[comment]It's the Palestinians.

[comment]It is 1930's again boys!
[comment]Yo while we're dealing with the skinheads[comment]As a German I’m very confused by this. First of all there are barely any Jews left in Germany (most are of Eastern European decent) and secondly it say that there a bunch of neo nazis doing it. The only people in my community that are openly outspoken against Jews are my Muslims friends[comment]Now is this because the adf is getting bigger or because they're muslin population is much bigger? Curious
[comment]That was why Markel allowed the millions of muslims in to Germany[comment]How many times do we have to teach you this lesson[comment]Pretty sure this story isn’t going to be covered by the MSM
[comment]What does the “biased domain” tag mean?
[comment]See? It's not just in America.
[comment]Are you really telling me why only 50% of crimes are solved on average magically antisemitic crimes have a rate of over 95% showing these are all far right? Antisemitic crimes are defined as far right. All unsolved cases are counted as far right. You are willfully ignoring reality to stay in your bubble. Don Quixote fighting windmills made of swastikas.

But for the Democrat party[comment]Yes[comment]This is the hoax that the president was referring to - the dems and their media trying to capitalize on this by causing a panic and doing as much damage as they can to the economy.
[comment]"You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before." --Rahm Emanuel
[comment]They always make everything political. And it's never their fault. Even when it is[comment]This Republican president literally put millions of lives at risk by announcing the crisis to be under control and nothing to worry about. Only to flip 24 hours later with the truth because those closest to him finally stood up and said he was being a jackass I needed to stop speaking out of the side of his face. You want to try to latch onto politicians doing what politicians do that’s fine but everything the Democrats are trying to do[comment]Maybe President Trump should have done a better job preparing our testing infrastructure in the 2 months he had to get ready for this threat? 

This is how democracy works
Also
The Democrats are doing their job[comment]While the Corona virus was spreading overseas the asshat Democrats were busy with their peach mints.  Nothing else mattered to them.
[comment]Wait until the soft debate tonight (new rules for protecting Biden). The politicizing of a pandemic to criticize the right. Honestly[comment]It may be dangerous[comment]This place is becoming just like r/politics.
[comment]So do Republicans.  They tried to sneak abortion restrictions and banning encryption into bills relating to the virus.  It's just politics as usual.
[comment]When did this sub become r/politics 2.0?
[comment]Didn't Trump try to buy the pharmaceutical company that has been closest to creating a vaccine so he can sell it for a profit? That sounds like a pretty big exploit of a crisis.
[comment]Trump went from saying that the virus was a democrat hoax to national emergency in one week. Do you have brain damage?

[comment]If I know a family member that can give haircuts[comment]No I'm pretty and not a communist scumbag do as I say not as I do POS.
[comment]It’s because the stay-at-home orders aren’t there to protect people.

They’re there to hurt the economy and our president. This whole thing is a giant liberal scam that everybody is falling for

[comment]Just because a bunch of ignorant people think something doesn't make it the truth. Americans are really easy to persuade. The military votes by mail every year. Can our party get back to real issues now?
[comment]Just Two Thirds? LoL
[comment]Just what the democrats had in mind.
[comment]Where’s the proof there would be fraud?
[comment]People have been gathering and lining up at grocery stores for months so just put the voting booths there since Democrats don’t complain about those locations
[comment]What do actual professionals think?
[comment]But that is how the Democrats will "get rid of Trump[comment]If its vote by mail it will be a fraud fest.

[comment]not sure how it isn't 100%. 

Would phone in purchases of booze increase underage alcohol consumption?
[comment]Seriously?
[comment]I strongly believe that voting by mail would help prevent voter fraud. In fact I don’t think that there is any significant amount of voter fraud in this country. Hell you can barely get people to vote in the first place. Remember that committee that Kris Kobach ran<|startoftext|>

[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/30/twitter-and-social-media-are-a-cancer-on-our-civic-life-they-dont-deserve-protection/[comment]They are a cancer because under the excuse of being private they have attempted to portray their "portal" virtue allowing people to express themselves while at the same time censoring conservatives and manipulating search results to promote the left agenda.   When you have mega corporations like these trying to politically influence elections its time to regulate them or terminate them.
[comment]The beauty of living in a free society is that you could simply choose to not use Twitter if you don't like it so much. It would be frustrating if Twitter were the only option for social media... Maybe someone should[comment]Just delete your Twitter account.
[comment]100% agreed! 

That would put an end to all these disinformation campaigns[comment]Then don't use it[comment]The problem with Twitter and Social Media in general is that it gives everyone an equal platform to voice their opinions. The problem is not all opinions are equal and don’t deserve any platform with which to be heard.
[comment]To all those who are saying “dOnT uSe iT”. I believe this guy is trying to say[comment]Yeah but so are republicans so 🤷‍♀️
[comment]Yeah but that doesn’t mean we have the right to shut them down. Let people do what they want. Just hold yourself accountable to the values you place on others.

[comment]Don't take it lightly. Ask Steve Scalise if he does. Bernie attracts radicals and they have nothing to lose.
[comment]What? This is fake news 100%
[comment]I worry that Bernie won't know the first thing about executive power and will let the lunatics into his administration. He's not going to know how to pick a cabinet or surround himself with wise counsel. His court will be full of inexperienced fire-brand extemists who have no idea how to wield power. I predict that his administration will resort to iron-fisted and poorly executed methods to exercise his agenda. Do we have any evidence that Bernie knows the first thing about executive power?
[comment]If you put the spotlight on crazy all you see is crazy.
[comment]Mark my words[comment]What kind of Facebook post looking click bait is this crap? Just because someone supports Bernie doesn’t mean they are trying to burn cities. Just means they don’t understand economics or they want “free” stuff.

[comment]I’ve got to show this to a few people.
[comment]The next stages is where the administration steps in and says that they expect passing grades.  So the teacher grades on the curve and everyone gets a B no matter what.  It's a change from economics knowledge backed grades to fiat grades.  For a while[comment]I'm inclined not to believe this. The administration would have stepped in to make sure the students got the grade they earned fair and square.

[comment]I saw someone call Obama a republican the other day on r/politics

He could shoot his load early and endorse Joe. Obama alienates the Bernie people and hurts the Dems. He alienated the Bernie supporters and a good chunk vote for Trump. If Joe loses
If Obama endorses Bernie
Obama’s best move is to wait to for Joe to pick a VP [comment]Where are republicans while their party descends into facism?
[comment]Fascinating because I recall he was accused of socialism himself.
[comment]His absence is pretty remarkable right? Would've thought he was going to give Joe a pat on the butt at some point before super Tuesday but nope. Water[comment]Enjoying his millions in peace
[comment]Agreeing with them full stop.   Obama does not disagree with communism.  He helped it around the world and praised the "positive" of communism and even told venezuelans there really is no difference between silly capitalist/communist labels.  Just vote for what {feels good} is right.
[comment]Obama is part of the movement toward Socialism and he's working in the background.
[comment]Obama doesn't give a shit about any of that. He just wanted to the pay day of being the president and he's cashed in on that like no other. The party falling to shit means nothing because Trump already destroyed any political legacy he was ever going to have and since it doesn't benefit him he just doesn't care. He'd rather be making absurd money helping Netflix come up with some half baked TV show.
[comment]Obama will walk up wearing a MAGA hat and say that he purposely sabotaged the Democratic party™ to pave the way for Trump[comment]he's enjoying the view...his dream come true

[comment]Who do you think made the calls to Bob O'Rourke[comment]He's laughing his ass off because during his entire presidency you guys called him a socialist.
[comment]Honestly I don't mind Obama staying out of it.

Former presidents should wait until a nominees pick and then get behind them
[comment]The dems have been supporting the “middle class” as their platform
Hence
But this started when dems began accepting lobby money during the Clinton era. They kept losing elections because money bought republicans over and over again. 3 decades later
Quite unfortunate

[comment]W
[comment]Ben Shapiro talked about this on his show yesterday and he said to all of the people attacking Facebook to be careful because Elizabeth Warren controlling Facebook is infinitely worse than the petty and minor grievances people have against the company.
[comment]The rest of society doing well apparently sucks to Mark.
[comment]I actually don’t completely disagree with Zuckerberg or Warren on this particular subject. 

It’s very much a two way street. Facebook has clearly
The issue is our government should really not be getting that deeply involved with a normal business. It could just as easily be a cover for both republicans and democrats to try and take a grip on a vein of social power like Facebook
Ideally it should be the populace who see corruption in a business and stop investing into their product. Move to a different company; however in the case of big tech you have a lot of people too addicted to change. 

Idk honestly all around it’s a really sticky situation and it doesn’t seem like it has an outcome that is fair.
[comment]I agree. As I don't think he's a fan of Trump what would he do if she won the nomination?
[comment]He ain’t lying
[comment]He's right y'know.
[comment]Liberals.

Socialism is all the rage until it it turns its greedy eye your way[comment]**MANUFACTURED CONSENT**

"Wallstreet fears an Elizabeth Warren presidency" - The Hill

"Warren has put the fear of god into Wallstreet" - Axios

"Elizabeth Warren 2020 has Wallstreet very angry" - Vox 

"Wallstreet is scared of Elizabeth Warren" - CNBC 

Elizabeth "Capitalist To My Bones" Warren poses no threat to this immoral/rigged system. It's all fake. A fluke to prevent an actual reformist from being elected. The purpose of this manufactured bullshit is to sway politically illiterate "progressive" voters towards supporting Warren over the only actual candidate the wealthy fear. I don't even have to say his name. You already know. 

The 1% wouldn't tell voters who to vote for if they want to stick it to the 1%. That's why Warren gets all the attention from the mainstream propaganda machine while Voldemort's name is rarely mentioned unless it's negative news. 🌹

[title]How Did the Bidens' Corruption Become Trump's Scandal?
[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2019/12/18/__trashed-888/[comment]The left are total masters of projection
[comment]To cover their asses
[comment]Funny[comment]It's bad timing. Calling the investigation on Biden in the midst of a campaign? I hate creepy Joe but you gotta admit[comment]Because Orange Man Bad
[comment]Biden is involved in shady business[comment]Leftism is a mental illness
That's how it got this far
[comment]Biden was confusing official business that was in the interest of the United States (in conjunction with a group of other nations). His actions were not suspect and have nothing to do with Trumps actions. 

Trump asked a foreign nation to take action that was in his personal interest and used the power of his office to try and make this happen. 

Linking the two is a mental illness
[comment]Because three years of hyperbolic scandals cant be wrong. This is the narrative to reinforce delusional projections of Orange man bad.

He has governed way more conservative than expected setting historical figures of social progression but that doesent matter.

The media said he was bad day one so they cant lost their credibility and they have to reinforce the delusional farce that there is a crisis.

This is not a scandal. It is a new precedent of political attacks that will forever change how both parties conduct themselves. 

The Democrats overplayed their hand on this one and it will haunt them for the next decade.

Watching Joe Biden want to pick fights is kinda interesting. His temper sets off randomly which is definitely not decency or dignified lol makes me worried he has some underlying condition... 

The democrats have definitely not been unified at all. It’s so unorganized. I find it hard to believe they have a shot to win unless they get their stuff together.

Elon Musk is right. Work is a noble undertaking
Shutting down the economy to try and avoid one kind of death does not end death. All you have done is trade death by the virus for death by starvation. 

Shutting down the economy was designed to not overwhelm the health services.  So mission accomplished.  It was not intended to avoid death. Keeping the economy closed is not going to provide any more benefits than it already has. But it will introduce a lot more negatives than the virus could ever have done.  

So let just remember this about communists that are seeking to use this attack by the Chinese Communist Party to accelerate their revolution and maximize economic damage to the United States: 

"Communists never fix the problem they simply fix the blame and manufacture the problem. Because problems for communists are a fundraising opportunity and a political stage."

[selftext]https://freebeacon.com/columns/trump-calls-the-ayatollahs-bluff/[comment]Iran: "we will declare war!"

Also Iran: doesn't declare war
[comment]It hasn’t even been 24 hours. I think there is still time...
[comment]Iran has 0 aircraft carriers and no long range bombers.  They have no ICBM missles.  They also have no military bases outside of Iran.  Safe to say we have no issues on US soil other than some deranged Iranian americans who might get salty.  That being said Isreal might get fucked with but we will be there to support them with airstrikes intelligence etc.
[comment]I’m so glad I’m subscribed to this subreddit[comment]The Ayatollah of Diet Coca Cola
[comment]And to think Obama give them billions of our tax dollars to be used against us.  They should claw back Obama’s pension for shire stupidity!
[comment]Alright noob!  What a joke!
[comment]Unfortunately I'm scared this was the start of a dangerous game. There is still time for them to react dramatically. War is a dangerous game that gets the innocent people killed we should do all we can to avoid it!

I can't see any strategic benefits from removing him other than feeling good about killing a "Bad Guy". An escalation that could potentially put so many more sons and daughters in harms way. 

I'm trying to look at the big picture and understand what's the end game is. US put the maximum pressure on Iran to force them back to the negotiation table[comment]Is it possible/likely that if Iran were to retaliate[comment][https://youtu.be/MEx4wMfTQCc](https://youtu.be/MEx4wMfTQCc)

This is a far worse illegal scheme than the moves democrats have made to allow illegals to vote.

[title]Coronavirus shows Donald Trump was right all this time about China
[selftext]https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/486671-coronavirus-shows-donald-trump-was-right-all-this-time-about-china[comment]Lot of quiet.
[comment]I haven't read the article yet but : " Madison Gesiotto is an attorney who serves with the advisory board of the Donald Trump campaign" At least they admit bias like this instead of sites like the Guardian
[comment]One thing is for sure.  The Chinese never have[comment]It was time to divest from China 15 years ago. If American businesses don’t get the picture after this pandemic[comment]We should pull all pharma manufacturing back to the US[comment]It’s suspected and privately confirmed by some Chinese scientists that this is a human created virus. The CCP meant to unleash this in Hong Kong during the summer when they start protesting again but it got out mistakenly in December when it wasn’t ready.
[comment]Isn’t this the same country with over a million Muslims in concentration camps ?
[comment]Fuck China.
[comment]Of course he was. They just don't want to admit it
[comment] Big Business market's seen an advantage with China[comment]But he didn’t do anything to make us less dependent on them?!?  His “deal” that they’re already violating is the same crap he railed against during his campaign but is pretty much the same deal we already had in place.  What happened to the guy that lambasted NAFTA as the worse trade deal ever[comment]I guess the principles behind the Chinese Exclusion Act was entirely correct[comment]It's amazing if Trump hadn't gotten control if all the traffic coming in we'd probably all be wheezing and coughing by now.

He just needs to fire whoever is in charge of testing at the CDC. I bet there's a lot of people who are with me on this. Wtf are they doing there when South Korea can process 15 K CV tests a day and we have only done 5K *to date*.

Testing is what will stop us from becoming Italy. They're scary af there.

[comment]The protesters had the moral high ground right up till they started to 'peacefully protest' by trying to murder everyone they hated.
[comment]I guess his life didn’t matter...
[comment]Imagine if people especially conservatives grasped the concept of Black Lives matter
[comment]How do you make a movement about how black lives are important then not care when one is killed by your own?
[comment]Still haven’t found the story on CNN 🙄 typical
[comment]Black lives only matter when a cop kills them. Where is the protest and outrage for Jaylon Mckenzie who was shot at a party. Where is the protesting for the innocent men and women killed by gang members. These numbers are much higher than the police involved killings. I'm not saying police brutality shouldn't be addressed I'm saying why is it black live only matter in that scenario. Why are we not on the streets demanding violence against police end. Why is there no call to end gang violence. Black lives[comment]There is a problem with people dying in police custody.
There are opportunists who use tragedy to push for anarchy.
David Dorn's death shows us that very little of this is real outrage. The Barbarians are at the gate and we let them in while foolish politicians condone the behavior.

[title]Democrats view on trump
[selftext]Me and my dad were talking the other day about how trump has handled the situation pretty well. As well as anyone could have with the info given anyway. And we were talking about how the democrats just despise him. He can't do right in their eyes and it really shows what kind of people they are. Not all democrats but most.

They would much rather millions more Americans die to coronavirus so they could blame it on him than to admit that he isn't that bad. Real patriotic right. What did Obama do when anything like this happened? With swine flu. Did nothing yet they praised him. I've even heard people saying Obama would of handled this way better.

I really didn't like trump when he got elected but I've changed my views after seeing how he has done. Since when is there anything wrong with putting America first and standing up to other countries and stop paying them all this money.

Any instances you guys have of stuff like this?[comment]Nice to hear a young independent thinker that came to a conclusion despite the constant negative buzz around trump.

If you would like to see the other view and lose all your fake internet points - go to r/politics and make this post.
[comment]I'm younger myself and came around to him just recently. In a previous life I'd even called myself a Democrat!

I really don't know what the deal is. He's even giving out money
Obama could have farted in Michelle's mouth bare assed on live TV and they'd be saying how much it helped people with COVID. Same could be said for Hillary[comment]So downplaying the virus and repeatedly saying it was just the flu until late Feb is responding well?
America will have more deaths than any other country and you still think trump is leading well?

[comment]Honest to goodness[comment]Ive recently had a change of mind after starting to follow this coronavirus closely 3 months ago. This is all being overblown. Antibody tests already showing that fatality rate is much much lower. We are being fucked economically right now from various angles. We need to reopen because just like in China and other places in Europe they are getting their second waves. We are going to have to ensure these lockdown restrictions again? It is going to be a damn cycle of this BS. This thing isnt going to disappear overnight. 

Average age of death from Wuhan and Italy last time I heard was 80-81 years old. Also the vast majority had some preexisting conditions. Vitamin D is something that helps against respiratory infections. Unfortunately we all have lower amounts of Vit D coming out of winter especially those of darker skin.

Oh nevermind[comment]Just so I’m clear... there’s never been poor people before 1848?

Interesting hypothesis.
[comment]It really depends. Go to Norway[comment]This entire demonization of the word socialism is stupid. An entirely socialistic system is stupid just like an entirely capitalistic system would be stupid. There are ideas on both sides of the spectrum that are good and bad. The way the united states pays for police currently is socialistic but I think it works pretty well. I wouldn't want a private police force. Giving agriculture huge bail outs is technically socialism but I don't think that was the best idea either. Yet on the other hand just letting a bunch of companies that produce food fail ( which is what the capitalistic answer would have been) probably isn't the best idea either. Labeling acts socialism is just another identity politics game to divide people which works because it takes away the need to talk about what is actually going on.

Yes
We should have also used our near 2 month head start to getting testing ready: free
South Korea was able to do this. They have had a good handle on this thing from day 1. Copious testing allowed them to catch new cases quickly and quarantine just those infected. So the number of new cases peaked quickly
There is no reason we couldn't have prepared for this as they did
The one good thing we have going for us

This and honestly the last 3 years of behavior by the Dems should be criminal.  They've wasted an incredible amount of time and tax money chasing after imaginary problems rather than being productive representatives who are bound to uphold the Constitution.

[comment]The six freaking minutes of creepy video of the guy doesn’t look great.
[comment]Their response would be “make the case for this fire extinguisher without discussing the fire”
[comment]Well it's hard not to mention any of the shit republican politicians considering how terrible of a job they're doing. It's also hard to do considering that's who Biden is running against and of course people are going to compare them. Do you view voting where you only support the person you like? Voting has always been a "which candidate is the least terrible."

There are things Biden would do that are better than Trump
Silly.
[comment]I don't know how anyone can see Donald trump and think "yessssssss this is exactly what George Washington had in mind yesss"
[comment] hashtag DropOutBiden is trending on twitter
[comment]I think it’s a valid statement regardless. Imo both are not ideal so I’m not going to argue for either of them lol. But I will say “this person is better than this person” and therefore this is who I’m supporting. It’s similar to the the 2016 election - there were a lot of people who voted against Hillary or Donald instead of for a candidate. What I don’t understand is how we keep finding ourselves in these positions 😂
[comment]I expect down votes and I won't be voting for either but the case can be made Biden has been better for the environment
[comment]Biden doesn't know who his wife is...he doesn't know what State he is in....thinks he is running for the Senate....He says China is no threat .....and he is quid pro quo hair sniffing groping sleepy Joe

Who would vote for him??????
[comment]They can't make the case with or without mentioning Trump
[comment]What was most amazing is how before Sanders dropped out the big subreddits (news
Now that Biden is their only fiddle you saw a whole round of opinion culling with "Maybe Biden isn't so bad" and "Vote Blue down the ticket"
Democrats want to win SO MUCH they'd sell their soul to China for it.

[comment]Isn't this just showing the desperation of the American people to get rid of him? Surely its reaching a point where people would rather have anybody at least slightly competent to run the country instead of Trump.




I miss boring politics...
[comment]Make the case for a fire extinguisher without mentioning the fire
[comment]instead of we need to elect Biden... we need to nominate someone other than Trump! Get young voters back in line with the Republican party. Back to actual core values of small government[comment]Why can't we mention Trump? He's the worst president this country has ever seen
[comment]to be fair
Not that I think Biden should be elected—at least I certainly hope he won’t be—but if someone’s only reaason for voting for him is “he is not trump” then I can understand why they would take that approach.
[comment]Well yes... trump is the reason that people will vote for Biden. Biden wouldn't be my first choice[comment]Or without saying something way out of current events and leg hair

It stopped being about George Floyd when organized attacks on businesses
It stopped being about George Floyd when a uniformed mob of thugs started chanting  "Kill the White man".

What kind of lunacy are we living in when white people are chanting " Kill White People"? 

It is an insurgency.  And that is what happens when one political party use the intelligence agencies and the federal bureau of investigations in a coup d'état to overthrow the president of the United States just because their Wall Street backers are pissed that their $500 billion dollars a year Chinese Communist Party grift has been ended. 

Hey
Fix your media messaging or lose everything you have.

Today should have been about America going back into space.  Wall Street made it about getting rid of the President of the United States because he has ended the game of selling out the United States citizens to the Chinese Communist Party.  A $500 Billion dollar a year grift that was bankrupting the nation and killing our citizens.  

Follow the money.  The groups that organized the nationwide terrorist insurgency are funded.  Their comms are trackable.  

Jamie &amp; Goldman fix it. Fire the talking heads across the board every network. Call Jack
Otherwise
The Chinese Communist Party trade is over. Done.  It is never[comment]How exactly would they know who the members are. All rioters and looters should be prosecuted. If someone is peacefully protesting and has an antifa sticker would they be charged?

That's sorta insulting to me because your completely disregarding what all the madness really started from. I'm sure somewhere there are antifa members doing whatever it is that they do but they have nothing to do with this. Calling out antifa and George Soros does what when we just witnessed the murder that broke the camel's back. I'm not looking to fight with y'all. I really want to know if you really and truly beleive this is all antifa.

Trump did nothing wrong[comment]&gt;I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It is clear from the July 25&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**the Senate should be ashamed by the rank partisanship that has been on display**. …**The President’s behavior was shameful and wrong.  His personal interests do not take precedence over those of this great nation**.  The president has the responsibility to uphold the integrity and honor of the office.  Not just for himself but for all future presidents.  **Degrading the office&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a “high crime and misdemeanor.” Yes&gt;

My verdict[comment]I am very glad to see the most upvoted comments here are being critical of the source. Don’t follow the media blindly; this article has a lack of real evidence- which is ironic considering their criticism of others lack of evidence- on a news source that is deemed generally unreliable.
[comment]The only gas was their own passing of it. Now can we stop promoting the fiction[comment]Fox news and CNN are both lying for sure. Videos were sent of looters and police doing illegal things. They only air .1 of 99.9 %  of that. Neither side shows video damming it's cause.

The final resolution of the case
When Amato made his claims
Did Trump family members steal from a children’s cancer charity?

The allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children’s cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state.

Amato’s viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general
Investigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds
The Associated Press
“A charity operated by one of Donald Trump’s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity’s board
Among other claims
— The Eric Trump Foundation failed to report multiple conflicts of interest by supposedly independent board members who work for The Trump Organization or Eric Trump’s winery
— Based on its revenue and giving
— Though public charity boards are supposed to represent the public
The 2017 Forbes article
It should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of “stealing

Cruz said these Democrat senators running for prez will be swamped in the Senate with this for 6 weeks and wont be able to campaign. Curious if she is doing it to help them out.
[comment]Why did the Democrats lie for 3 years about Russian collusion and obstruction of justice and not impeach the president? Do they take their voters as suckers? Yes
[comment]Obviously the point is to have Trump in the history books as officially impeached and never cleared by the Senate. He clearly isn't going to be removed from office by this. 

One of the few things people 100 years from now will know about Trump is that he was impeached.

Disagreed all you want[comment]This is the democrats game plan as far as I can tell[comment]I'll believe all this bluster when I see it. McConnell has disappointed before.
[comment]Good[comment]The way I understand it[comment]They’re hoping they’ll take the senate in 2020 then remove him when he gets re-elected? Not really sure what crazy Nancy is up to here[comment]Just look at the Vegas odds. It was -500 that he would get impeached (bet 500 you receive 100) and the odds that’s he’s removed from office are -5000. It’s just comically polar and has nothing to do with bipartisan action.

[comment]Fact: suicide among blue workers is at a 30 year high.
[comment]Is the trillion dollar national debt and weak growth not baked in to this equation?
[comment]Too bad you need 3 jobs to pay your bills. But the economy is doing tremendously big.
[comment]Not gonna lie. It's great for some. 

the people it's great for had it good anyway[comment]- ***Here's the reality. By most traditional measures[comment]It has been great for me!
[comment]It was also great under Obama. Its almost like we live in boom and bust periods of economic  growth.
[comment]The Democrats don't want to acknowledge this fact.
[comment]Liberals: but it's because Obama it just took 10 years for his plans to start working.

Me: just smiling and pitying how dumb they are.
[comment]The economy started coming back with the destruction of Obamacare[comment]Wait until the Boomers start retiring. Capital markets will contract significantly and interests rates will go way up. Enjoy this age of free money while it lasts.

Also the stock market is massively inflated due to an overflow of Boomer investments chasing any opportunity they can find. All those stocks will come down considerably and in that process tons of wealth will be lost.

Finally
On the other hand[comment]I don’t think anyone has mentioned the fact that we’re effectively seeing QE4 right now. Is the stock market pumping? Yes. Is that an effect of low unemployment or getting out of “bad trade deals” probably not.

We are doing the same thing we did in 2008 to get out of a depression but now we already have insanely low interest rates and low unemployment. 

Takeaway: if the economy really is so great we probably shouldn’t be massively increasing our money supply. Asset prices like stocks going up (in isolation) doesn’t equal a strong economy and can result in bubbles

[comment]For who though?
[comment]I'm with you. But there's been no real change in income inequality or the rising cost of healthcare. The thing is that his administration hasn't revealed any ideas to change things.

[comment]Simple. It's our money we have already paid in taxes and we want it back from the defenses industry. Also return the tax brackets for top 20 % back to pre Reagan. Done.

[comment]Taxes. Some of us pay close to 40 to 45% in taxes.  To those who are okay with the tax increase then they should pay for it and not force the rest of us into the disaster that is the government bureaucracy. This is being done at the barrel of a gun. They’re okay with putting some of us into the 70% tax range
The poor already get Medicaid and welfare this isn’t about redistribution of wealth[comment]We can just print it... and crush our own economy
[comment]This conversation just makes my ears steam.  In the broadest sense of the word "money
This is Democrats preying on the ignorant.  People think that just because someone like Sanders or Warren says they'll tax the rich to get 32 trillion dollars that there must actually be 32 trillion dollars out there that is collectible.  It never occurs to them that there isn't
So
And that right there is the problem with the Democratic Party.  They aren't actually interested in fixing anything.  They are only interested in power.  It doesn't matter what gets broken.  It doesn't even matter if there's a country left to govern.  As long as they have whatever power there is left to have
They truly are beyond help.

[title]Democrats Know They're Losing the Impeachment Battle With the Public
[selftext]https://pjmedia.com/trending/top-democrats-concede-theyre-losing-the-impeachment-battle/[comment]We do? News to me.
[comment]Pelosi certainly knows it. I wonder if she knew that handing over impeachment to a mendacious clown like Schiff would end up this way.
[comment]This so far as been a disaster for the dems
[comment]and it still won't matter. They knew it was a bad idea before it even happened and they STILL did it.
[comment]That... that is not at all what the original news story said.
[comment]The Dems spent a lot of political capital on impeachment. So they have to deliver.

If they don't impeach the President
The Dems will be in trouble with their base. Democratic voters think they have the President red handed. And the Dems don't impeach? Forget it. Many will be disillusioned and stay home in 2020. Rabid voters in NYC or LA will vote but the average Democratic voter in battleground states might stay home. Who knows[comment]I think theres some legitimate questions that can be asked about things over trumps presidency
This impeachment inquiry is just a joke and anyone who doesn't recognize that is apart of the problem. Understand
Its fine to hate trump[comment]Fantasy news is always fun to read

[title]'I think a lot of people cheat': Trump dismisses expanded mail-in voting during coronavirus outbreak
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-think-a-lot-of-people-cheat-trump-dismisses-expanded-mail-in-voting-during-coronavirus-outbreak[comment]100000000% TRUE AND RIGHT 

If you disagree you are probably a Democrat who relies on ballot harvesting and other election meddling methods.

Voter ID and go to a designated voting center. Don't like it? Then GTFO!!!
[comment]We have much higher instances if election fraud than voter fraud.
[comment]Can't we already vote by absentee ballot?
[comment]This should be a State issue[comment]Seems like the party continues this propaganda of supposed “cheaters”. The ideology that everyone is a cheater or cheats the system[comment]All voters should prove citizenship[comment]I don’t see any issue with mail-in voting with required social security number verification.  Obviously we have to make sure dead people aren’t voting but that should be easy enough.
[comment]Projection-based-decisions will get us nowhere.

Let's see some data and create a modern system of voting that's accessible and secure. Christ.
[comment]Two words: bloc chain...
[comment]"I think a lot of people cheat" seems to normally be something cheaters say. What does he mean here?  I'm confused
[comment]Just like he said on Fox News[comment]It's hard to parse out the exaggeration and negativity anymore but I just want to point out a few things that are implied here that nobody has mentioned yet.
1. He is undermining the security of the Postal Service which is a federal agency under the Executive branch. Undermining the Intelligence Departments2. He seems to be proposing we all go out and crown public buildings for hours on end to vote. This again is against the recommendations of the WHO3.  Isn't it just really embarrassing to read anything he says when it is typed out verbatim? Like[comment]The States will figure this out for themselves. This isn't a federal issue.

Beyond that
The primaries matter and they're utterly fucked up in process. The general election is far less important.

Died of cancer 10 years ago and his EX wife collects 100% of his $9000/mo pension for life.   Public service employees retire young and get job with Another authority and eventually collect double pensions.

California’s budget woes are many. I believe Pete Wilson issued IOU warrants in the early 90’s. CA later issued tax returns in in the form of an IOU in 2009.

Prior to Brown
When Governor Brown was in office
On to the highly paid public employees; those making $250k+. I’d agree some of the positions mentioned received exceptionally generous salaries. As for the cops and firefighters
Is California’s pension system ideal
Is it time for a recall like we did with Gray Davis in our last crisis. Check Newsom in his path? This is his springboard for the presidential run in 2024 or later.

Here is the from a 2019 report by [TexasPolicy](https://www.texaspolicy.com/5-2-trillion-of-government-pension-debt-threatens-to-overwhelm-state-budgets-taxpayers/)

1.	Alaska
2.	California 
3.	Connecticut 
4.	Illinois 
5.	Arkansas 
6.	Hawaii
7.	Ohio
8.	New Jersey 
9.	Nevada
10. New Mexico 

A more comprehensive 2017 report from Pew can be found [here](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/06/the-state-pension-funding-gap-2017).

This report has a per state chart in Appendix B. 

IMO we need serious pension reform nationwide but one of the first steps has to be eliminating abuses of the system like double dipping.

Ideally
There should be parity between how companies provide for employees and how the government provides for them.

[comment]Cause money
[comment]Italy more than likely is not lying and other countries whose information we have access to are in the same boat. We can compare our data to theirs and then come up with a baseline. Then run that against what China reported and likely determine the actual truth. We are behind them as are other countries. Time will tell and the analysis will become available. 

And yes[comment]Chinese investors own 80% of Hollywood[comment]Wait I don't understand.  Even this article only claims that China lied in Jan not months.

[comment]I sometimes wonder what this land would look like had Columbus never bravely sailed across the ocean.

The stories of the “indigenous” people don’t always point to a gracious and all loving people. They were hunter gatherers while European cultures had progressed nearly into the Industrial Age by the time they had reached the new world.
[comment]I side on the indigenous people day on this one. We are “celebrating” Columbus Day under absolutely no merit. He didn’t discover America. There is proof that others had been here before[comment]Very good article
[comment]C. Columbus[comment]I don’t think Columbus deserves to have a holiday named after him because he didn’t really do much besides slaughter and destroy a culture[comment]Did this get brigaded? Columbus was a total asshole who raped and murdered American Indians[comment]I own a manufacturing company and gave my 17 employees the day off!  Although I am sure my sales guys won't ....

Our email said "Happy Columbus Day!"

I had one of our two office assistants email me and say "It is indigenous day"

I actually "replied to all" forwarding it to everyone in my company letting them now that they are getting off for Columbus day
Whatever that is....

I look forward to her shutting up or quitting[comment]I was at the gym this morning in my town that is full of SJW’s and left class to observe a sixty something woman chewing out the gym clerk because the class trainer called today Columbus Day. She was so offended she claimed she almost had to leave. Unbelievable!
[comment]No shit.
[comment]I don’t care at all how the day is called and we should stop arguing about it.
[comment]While I care less about the holiday
We bring our kids to these kinds of things and it's a great learning experience. Stuff I didn't know about too[comment]No one is indigenous to the Americas. Who does the proposed holiday celebrate?
[comment]The thing I find most disturbing is that most people seem to think American Indians were exactly like Na’Vi from Avatar. Native Americans were brutal to the extreme[comment]Columbus did not discover the Americas. He wasn't even the second person to find it. millions of people already knew about the Americas before him. columbus was responsible for shit tons of racism which caused thousands of casualties and many more lives in poverty or working as slaves for rich snobs. Fuck columbus day.
[comment]It's just a holiday so I dont really care. I think having columbus day is good just for educational history purposes. Like everyone knows Christopher Columbus in the US. I think the reasons for removing Columbus because he committed "genocide" as if the Aztecs were not sacrificing a quarter of a million slaves is weak. Why not have both holidays? A indigenous peoples day to appreciate the original inhabitants of this country makes sense. Having it replace Columbus day I think is unwarranted.

[title]Trump's New Hampshire vote total more than doubles Obama's in the 2012 primary

[comment]in the past week many of my family and friends who have stuck with the democratic party are now fed up with the craziness of the left. More an more people are #walkaway and join us Republicans. All are welcome
[comment]The reason this is such a big deal is because New Hampshire is a crazy left leaning state. If that many turned out for the primary’s then it looks like overall Trump might be getting a lot more electoral votes this time.
[comment]So democrats are crossing over?  That implies they aren’t behind the progressive wing candidates and anyone named Biden.
[comment]This is all fine and good but what’s the opposite turnout from now and then? That’s just as important a piece of the puzzle
[comment]Trump's numbers are the largest they've been in 4 decades. I don't think Dems are going to be prepared for how big the wave is going to be in November...

You mean to tell me that a professional degree with a major in “Activism” doesn’t pay enough to support a household? I’m shocked! Shocked[comment]So a study from Berlin posted in a UK newspaper is supposed to be relevant to an American Political environment? Ok.
[comment]sounds about right
[comment]What you mean is that the activist and his parents share a state sanctioned domicile[comment]Uhhhhh ya think
[comment]What defines the term ‘activist’? Because I’ve never heard of a right-wing activist.
[comment]Yeah that’s how they can afford to not work and protest all day lol
[comment]And most likely don't pay any taxes and want free stuff.
[comment]I find this to be unsurprising...this isn't even a shocking piece of news.

Good call Trump[comment]Starvation or fish?
California: SaVe ThE FiSh!! /s
[comment]You guys understand that alot of this water is going to vineyards and cash crops not food right?
Like I'm all for proper water sourcing but a huge reàson why California set up water standards is shortages and those shortages are in a large part do to water waste or cash crop usage that doesn't lower food prices.
[comment]California state wishes are traitorous against the United States
[comment]As a resident of the Central Valley[comment]Ca is really unhinged these days. Its sad
Trump’s order comes as the state has taken several steps to deal with the water scarcity that has lasted for decades.

*“It would be different if you had a droughtThe state is expected to fight the order.*
[comment]General Etc needs to stop whining about finger fish. Farmers need that water. Good job again President Trump.
[comment]Sacramento doesn’t was CA to grow any crops.
[comment]Isn't this literally a state issue?
[comment]California is the largest food producer in the country. It is of vital national security interest that the farmers get water.
[comment]Can someone please explain to me why California would put the lives of a few fish over a farmer's ability to produce food for this country? Honestly don't understand.
[comment]So the Brawndo wasn't working?
[comment]The biggest thing here is the relaxation of rules around fish that were considered "pressured"
The federally controlled Central Valley Project can do so immediately.

Good news for Californians.
[comment]Democrats wanted to control water on farms. Trump diverts water to farms. 
Checkmate
[comment]Honestly Commiefornia has some truly stupid water rights laws. The Resnicks are a great example. They were basically given all the water in a back room deal. Then those dumb farmers go an plant crap like pistachios which drink up a ton of water. They're all so stupid.
[comment]Non American here:

Why are the democratic states so poorly run? Are they seriously considering sabotaging one of the best regions on the planet for fruit and vegetables growth for the sake of saving a species of fish?

A state saturated in sun with large room for farming but no water to stop a species of fish going extinct? How about collect some of those fish and move the species somewhere else if your concerned about it’s survival.

We would kill for that weather over in Ireland to grow all types of produce
Yeah great idea we will have a diverse range of all the fish but we won’t have any food ourselves not unlike that PhD who said we should exterminate ourselves to save the planet<|startoftext|>
[title]Fact Check: No[selftext]https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/04/23/fact-check-no-trump-didnt-propose-injecting-people-with-disinfectant/[comment]It is not only BAD that multiple outlets are misreporting on this
Let me explain. We all know that Trump isn't a doctor. At no point has he ever claimed to be a doctor. Yes... he touts his intellect a lot
For the media to claim that Trump has said people should inject themselves with disinfectant is DANGEROUS.

Consider this. When he talked about "hydroxychloroquine" (because there had been reports of positive impacts from it) and some dude died because he took (or was given) fish tank cleaner...they blamed Trump. They said Trump had blood on his hands because this dude died from taking fish cleaner.

Considering that they think Trump has the magical power to induce people to do the things that he suggests....WHY would they misreport this and say that he suggested injecting "disinfectant".

If someone DOES to it and dies or has adverse effects
Here's what he said after a doctor talked about what kills the virus. Sunlight and isopropyl alcohol are best and a lab is studying that...the virus in secretions
"Can I ask a question because some of you are wondering...supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it's UV or powerful light and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you are going to test it and suppose you get the light inside the body and you said you are going to check that and about the disinfectant can you do something with that injection inside or with a cleaning in the lungs because it gets inside the lungs and you said that the lab's going to check that..."

So this isn't Trump saying
Anyone saying otherwise is a lying moron.
[comment]So to sum it up[comment]Real responsible guy right there announcing such a stupid thing to the whole world. Lol[comment]whether or not he outright suggested it[comment]Um he did. Don’t need to twist into a pretzel to defend everything dumb thing he says.
[comment]Republican mental gymnastics lol
[comment]Do you have a source that isn't extremely biased?
[comment][Here is the video] of the expert talking and then Trump returning to make his now infamous comments. He comes back on at about 27:45 minutes.

He was merely asking the expert about possible treatments and asking for them to be studied. Now is it kinda silly or uninformed to think that disinfectant in the body is a good idea? Probably
It does sound kinda silly and ignorant when he asked it<|startoftext|>

[comment]Could she be anymore desperate?

[comment]Biden- please please pick her.
[comment]She has that supermodel gig to fall back on if the VP thing doesn't work out.
[comment]Hard to believe she can step at all

[comment]If she’s asked to run as VP[comment]BWAHAHAHAHAHA!
[comment]If you feel the earth move[comment]"One giant step for Hamkind"
[comment]Yeah but is anyone asking?
[comment]So
 I'm always confused by these types. She's hundreds of thousands in debt[comment]if she stepped down a gap as deep as her tooth gap is wide then she would probably get hurt too bad from the fall to be VP and how is she stepping down as governor if she’s not the governor?
[comment]Worthless democrat pos.
[comment]She should fix the gap between her teeth first.
[comment]Lizzo but political
[comment]Great one!
[comment]Did anyone else watch her hopes and dreams come crashing down on MSNBC the other day? I think you can actually pinpoint the exact moment her spirit leaves her body. It was so good.
[comment]Idk she can always fall back on writing more smut. She wasn’t even good at that though.
[comment]No one sane of mind would pick her. But then we're talking about Biden[comment]She needs to be careful where she steps. Somewhere structurally sound[comment]Oh god[comment]I'm disappointed by the number attacks on her physical appearance in this thread.  Let's focus on what's wrong with her policies and world view.
[comment]She is such a joke... the meaning of hypocrite... well all the dems fit that role🤦‍♂️
[comment]Lol. The only thing she would run for is an open buffet! She fat!
[comment]She is not the governor. Brian Kemp won. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams
[comment]She's not even governor tho
[comment]I think she is too black tho according to Biden
[comment]On today’s episode of Delusional.

[comment]She is far from qualified for VP

But Biden is far from qualified for President also

They would make a good pair

[title]Trump Could Flip California...Here's How
[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/kiradavis/2020/03/02/791997/[comment]Gotta be some Americans in California[comment]Yea because all the Californians who ruined their state are moving to Texas to turn it blue and destroy Texas 

It’s like they don’t know they are the problem 

Probably the lack of critical thinking skills that is hampering them
[comment]A lot of Blue States have signed The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. So if Trump gets the popular vote[comment]Zero chance this happens. 

You are using too much reason and logic.
[comment]That would be outstanding. I voted for him here in California[comment]Ain't no way trump flips commefornia.

[comment]That would be great[comment]Flip Vermont[comment]I live in California. Can confirm it is suffering from Democrats. Will vote Trump again. Hope the optimism of this article pans out.
[comment]I live in So Cal[comment]He would flip NYS first. That will never happen. Our elections are rigged[comment]The snowflake tears would flood the streets.

One can dream.
[comment]It’s never gonna happen things to mass immigration.
[comment]Wow you guys are so delusional. Demographic change has already happened and is continuing.
[comment]The AB5 Bill consequences are showing exactly what Democrats have said would never happen to bills like this. 

“Small businesses are not going to fire employees or increase the cost of products even if you make it more expensive to have employees on staff.” 

I’ve heard a version of that phrase over and over when talking about bills that force small businesses to have higher expenses. The problem is that small businesses have to make money or they will have to close their doors and even if they are really nice people
The AB5 bill will give a small number of employees better benefits and higher wages[comment]Simple thing that everyone saw coming with special interest politics that dems always play: once we are in we have an agenda[comment]Because of Corona Virus policies everyone living in California come Election Day should vote for Trump.

[title]GOP rightly blocked Nancy Pelosi’s mail-in-balloting nonsense
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/gop-rightly-blocked-nancy-pelosis-mail-in-balloting-nonsense[comment]Oregon has mail in voting and has one of the highest voter turnout rates in the country. We vote in EVERY election because it just comes to your mailbox. No lines[comment]They're just going to keep trying until one day they successfully sneak it in. "Never let a good crisis go to waste."
[comment]A big concern in this thread seems to be duplicate ballots
Edit: grammar
[comment]The mail-in-balloting would help people avoid congested areas[comment]I helped my grandma vote by mail and the vote people called to confirm it was actually her that voted bc her signature has degraded so much.

I trust mail in voting way more than electronic voter booths.  Paper trail baby.
[comment]Why are republicans against this? Assuming they fear the voter fraud issues?
[comment]Key points in the article:

Pelosi wanted to include $4 Billion to mandate that all states implement the same universal mail balloting system. 
Republicans wanted to give $400 million while giving the States the freedom to decide how the money would be spent to help their states election system.

Both sides want to help the people vote during this trying time. They are taking a different road to the same destination. 

In my humble opinion[comment]Screw mail in ballotting. Let’s just declare Election Day a holiday so that the poor who can’t take time of otherwise will be able to do so.
[comment]Why do Democrats think voting is so hard. In Canada you have to provide two pieces of ID or one and a voter card at a polling station. I don't see why they are trying to make a system that is already easier than most in the democratic world more easy and more susceptible to fraud.

[comment]The definition of peaceful has changed quite a bit recently.

Also it’s funny that the anti lockdown protests were partially against civil unrest. Pretty sure a lot of people said forcing 25% unemployment for 3 months while releasing criminals for a disease that kills the elderly was a bad idea. Justice must be served for the cops but this wouldn’t have blown up so bad if people were working

[title]First Common Core Graduates Worst-Prepared For College In 15 Years
[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/first-common-core-high-school-grads-worst-prepared-for-college-in-15-years/[comment]Common core is so asinine.  It tries to teach the kids the tricks at math before they learn the fundamentals.  Without a fundamental foundation
Follow that up with the reading.  I had to go back and teach my kids how to read because the new method of teaching reading is by forcing them to learn "sight words" which they then piece together into full words

Common Core blows
[comment]As a teacher
Because it superceded NCLB
Early in my teaching career my Republican governor came to my school when we adopted it and spoke of how important CC was. 

I agree its foolish but theres no "liberal v conservative" notion in pedagogy. I teach. Kids learn. It doesnt really matter what party is in power or what initiatives they endorse.
[comment]Unpopular opinion here.  Common core and standardized testing are good for accountability. 

I don’t get why Republicans hate it. 

I get why liberals hate it. They don’t want teachers to be held accountable for actually teaching accurate things.
[comment]When I showed my kids how I was taught to do math
Thing is
One of the things they were having trouble with was division. They were only taught box division and that long division can only do up to two digits. Beyond that
o.0

I corrected them of that notion right away and my wife complained to the school about the math instruction. They had zero issues picking up algebra when listening to me. My 3rd child loved my college algebra notes. She called the cheat codes to the universe. The math was simple and broken down step by step for everything

[comment]I definitely agree the police officer should be charged. However[comment]The riots don’t help. But let’s not act like people don’t riot and loot and vandal over meaningless things like winning a sports championship.
[comment]He may get charges but probably not convicted. 

1. A conviction will deter cops from doing their job and trying to arrest people due to the fear of going to prison. 

2. A jail sentence is a death sentence for practically any cop. Criminals do not like cops and judges know this. 

3. A conviction would essentially validate the rioters actions and cause more of them in the future. 

None of the cops that the animals have rioted over in the past few years have gotten convicted and I don’t believe this will be a first.

Well I'm about to get sick

From watchin' my TV

Been checkin' out the news

Until my eyeballs fail to see

I mean to say that every day

Is just another rotten mess

And when it's gonna change
Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot...

I seen the cops out on the street

Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff

And chokin' in the heat

Listened to reports

About the whisky passin' 'round

Seen the smoke &amp; fire

And the market burnin' down

Watched while everybody

On his street would take a turn

To stomp and smash and bash and crash

And slash and bust and burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Well you can cool it
You can heat it...

'Cause
Take your TV tube and eat it

'N all that phony stuff on sports

'N all the unconfirmed reports

You know I watched that rotten box

Until my head began to hurt

From checkin' out the way

The newsmen say they get the dirt

Before the guys on channel so-and-so

And further they assert

That any show they'll interrupt

To bring you news if it comes up

They say that if the place blows up

They'll be the first to tell

Because the boys they got downtown

Are workin' hard and doin' swell
And if anybody gets the news

Before it hits the street
They say that no one blabs it faster

Their coverage can't be beat

And if another woman driver

Gets machine-gunned from her seat

They'll send some joker with a brownie

And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Hey you know something people

I'm not black

But there's a whole lots a times

I wish I could say I'm not white

Well
And the local people turnin'

On the merchants and the shops

Who used to sell their brooms and mops

And every other household item

Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em

And they say it served 'em right

Because a few of them are white
And it's the same across the nation

Black &amp; white discrimination

They're yellin' "; You can't understand me!";

And all the other crap they hand me

In the papers and TV

'N all that mass stupidity

That seems to grow more every day

Each time you hear some nitwit say

He wants to go and do you in

Because the color of your skin

Just don't appeal to him

(No matter if it's black or white)

Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we gotta sit around at home

And watch this thing begin

But I bet there won't be many left

To see it really end

'Cause the fire in the street

Ain't like the fire in my heart

And in the eyes of all these people

Don't you know that this could start

On any street in any town

In any state if any clown

Decides that now's the time to fight

For some ideal he thinks is right

And if a million more agree

There ain't no great society

As it applies to you and me

Our country isn't free

And the law refuses to see

If all that you can ever be

Is just a lousy janitor

Unless your uncle owns a store

You know that five in every four

Just one amount and nothin' more

Don't watch the rats go across the floor

And make up songs about being poor

Blow you harmonica son!

[comment]The autopsy found drugs in his system that may have caused his bad heart to give out. Also he and the cop had worked together previously. I wonder about what is going to happen to either their or their families bank account a month from now?  This is a crazy conspiracy theory but: what if the whole thing was a setup?  He took something just before the cop got there that would kill him. The cop was supposed to make it look like he was being crushed to death and make sure the whole thing was filmed for the world to see. The riots were pre-organized and talking points and allies already set in advance.  Yes I know this sounds crazy but what if?  You don’t think they both had money troubles and someone they wanted taken care of for life?

[title]Boris Johnson's government is reportedly furious with China and believes it could have 40 times more coronavirus cases than it claims
[selftext]https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-boris-johnsons-government-reportedly-furious-with-china-2020-3[comment]Shouldn't have been kissing China's ass and refusing to join us in excluding them from owning part of the UK's telecommunications then. Dumb fuck.
[comment]The entire world needs to hold their communist government responsible for the creation and spread of the Wuhan Virus.


Oh[comment]It’s amazing how the left is suddenly defending China because to blame them for all of this means blame gets lifted from Trump.
[comment]Apparently[comment]&gt; ... the prime minister could abandon his previous decision to let Chinese telecomms company Huawei develop the UK's 5g network.

Ho Lee Fuk[comment]No way! China lies? Who could have seen that coming
[comment]40X is an interesting number for Boris to throw out there. My wife's former classmates from med school in China and are still based there[comment]It probably does [comment]It may even be worse!
[comment]It’s hard to tell what anything is true. The media’s credibility was in very rough shape before this happened. I am starting to morph into the idea that instead of hoping I don’t get the virus. I am more hoping that I can survive and become immune to the virus. Time will expose truths
[comment]Waiting fo the Boris is racist stories from Wapo
[comment]and yet somehow Trump is getting 90% of the blame for this.
[comment]The world should at the very least hold the Chinese government accountable for allowing a market place of exotic/household animals. This is 2020[comment]BorisJohnson pulled an Italy and continued to shake hands despite warnings and now has it
[comment]China is totally lying. This isn’t a conspiracy theory
They’ve made the decision not to care about their over 70/unhealthy (the vulnerable).
[comment]Of course. It’s the CCP. They cover things up all the time. Tiananmen square?
[comment]I think it's safe to assume China's authoritarian regime is underreporting the numbers. That seems obvious.
[comment]Impossible[comment]This whole source and story smells like BS
[comment]Meanwhile on the r/news and r/politics subs you can watch the masses of reddit faithfully sucking China's dick just to have a chance at sticking it to their own country and family. No wonder the average piece of shit cancerous redditor has a cuckolding fetish.  


China has had a MASSIVE amount of deaths from this virus and has had to order tens of thousands of urns from all the cremations.

This virus is absolutely dangerous and what is going on is terrible...but don't miss reddit's chance to talk up fascism and boot licking for a minor increase in security

[comment]Wouldn't we rather the Dem nominee be Biden though?  Trump can beat him.  Probably pretty handily.  Maybe wait until after he is the nominee to really lay out the evidence.  I fear Tulsi - a left-winger who is starting  to play the centrist better and better.
[comment]i dont understand.  why do most Democrats feel they have an impenetrable case? Ive never followed politics as much as i have in the last 6 months and ive been watching the hearings and its pretty transparently clear they have nothing. but i see many people on reddit/fb who are 100% certain he will be impeached for "abusing his power" and saying that he did everything hes being accused of. but theres no evidence of it...anywhere.. are these people just delusional or what? god forbid you disagree with them they will eat you alive.

[comment]Honestly the hair is too nice[comment]Give more to the few kids who have too much and hope they give others the rest.
[comment]I think you've missed what Bernie has been proposing. The better comparison would be if all the candy manufactured was hoarded by 1% of the population.  Then this 1% is under some sort of delusion that anyone that doesn't have as much candy as them is because they are lazy. Then you put on a Bernie mask ensure that this 1% isn't allowed to hoard everything to themselves and provide access to an education that would help make sure they can get jobs then earn their own candy all while making sure they will get quality healthcare without risk of bankruptcy. But he gives away nothing but opportunity for people to make a quality life.

The more effective approach will be to accuse him of unnecessarily torpedoing the economy.  Eventually we'll see this thing was far less deadly than thought (early numbers like two million dead absent lock downs will be shown to be complete insanity by serological testing).

The media will completely forget their role in stirring up the panic and compelling politicians to act without good data.  All the economic hardship will be placed at Trump's feet.

It is desperate and dangerous of the dems to try to tie coronavirus to Trump. There will likely be a breakthrough in this battle between now and November. Trump could make it thru this storm on a tide of an expanding economy and a resolution to the virus. It could be like Thatcher welcoming the royal navy back from the Falklands.
   
If there is a happy resolution the dems could be caught once again flat-footed and without a cohesive agenda. The smart move for the dems is to be seen as cooperating with Trump across the board. Open up with kindness like Gandhi or the Dalai Lama. In this way the dems can be perceived as part of the solution and not part of the problem. 

Next the dems need to start converting Trump voters. Take a status quo stance on the second amendment. Allow for a moderate immigration policy. Extend an olive branch to poor white Americans. Allow some ideological diversity into their tent. 

The dems can do these things and still retain their core values. A little compromise and they could convert wide swathes of the Trump voter base. Instead of talking about global warming and taking broad measures to combat that

These are the secrets to defeating Trump. Until there is some kind of re-alignment in the DNC<|startoftext|>

[selftext]https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/04-ID-Cure-LI-600.jpg[comment]So afraid of the american people having a voice lmao
[comment]Honestly. These cartoons are not very good. The punchline is always so obvious. This is not how you make a joke.
[comment]Is there evidence of voter fraud sufficient to warrant our concerns?

It's like [1000 cases](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud) nationwide per year. From a more libertarian mindset
I understand election security concerns. I get why you might want to make it more difficult for people who don't agree with you to vote (even though that's unethical). But I've yet to see the data to back the position that people are fraudulently voting en masse or in significant quantities to warrant making the voting process equally or more cumbersome
[comment]The issue is that some states cannot pull it off. Some states do it every year[comment]This is a non-issue and everyone knows it. Voter fraud or harvesting is so scarce that it couldn’t possibly significantly affect an election. This has been tested and proven. In addition to mail in voting being pretty secure and the infrastructure for it already exists. I really don’t know why the GOP is so concerned about mail in voting. What is the real reason the GOP doesn’t want this going full scale?
[comment]Had a coworker that would vote for her mother[comment]Yeah[comment]Doesn't the military vote by mail? I do almost every year(using an absentee ballot). I prefer sitting down at my computer and researching as I vote. How exactly is this standard practice suddenly bad?
[comment]Not a Republican anymore and it’s this shit right here why I’m not. You will get people killed if you send them to the polls en masse to vote in November and every republican up there damn well knows it
[comment]Fraud is definitely possible with mail-in ballots<|startoftext|>

[comment]They love those emergency powers so much they are open about never giving them up. I wonder how many Californians will accept living under unrepresentative diktats.
[comment]Weren't people praising including the president Elon Musk for defying orders??
[comment]This is so stupid for them to open up already
[comment]Can’t wait for towns in Washington to do the same. Inslee would keep the lockdown in place even if we had 100 copies of Jesus himself in hospitals healing sick.
[comment]Should thin the MAGA heard quite nicely.

[comment]who the fuck is voting for joe biden i’m serious HOW does this disgusting man have so many supporters??? are the american people really so incompetent that they would rather have biden over sanders??
[comment]This is stupid. Putting his name on a check is an egotistical thing holding up money for people who need it.

[title]Meet the Other Seven—Yes SEVEN—Women Who Are Accusing Biden of Inappropriate Behavior

[comment]Hi[comment]This might get good...
[comment]Didn’t affect the president[comment]I don't believe anybody just from accusations alone
But the blatant hypocrisy coming from the left is an absolute shitshow.
[comment]You won’t see this on CNN
[comment]7 seems low
[comment]Joe's done... The hard part is gonna be getting the NOM to someone other than Bernie.  THAT'S gonna be the shitshow! Get your popcorn ready[comment]The media wants him out ASAP so the Democrats can insert Cuomo or Michelle Obama.
[comment]Grab em' by the pussy.
[comment]All rich people or at least most are sexual deviants. I think it's the love of money that makes them perverted. Money skews the moral compass. Most women love to rub elbows with rich men thinking they are the smartest guys on earth[comment]Creepy Joe
[comment]It’s so refreshing to hear what is actually being said.
[comment]Joe doesn't remember who he fingered

He thought it was more than seven
[comment]Hillary sucks
[comment]I don't really care all that much about the others.  The first one actually presented corroborating evidence and claims there is material evidence in her personnel file at Biden's office.  That's the claim that deserves all the attention.  At this point in our  nation's history[comment]Don’t believe any of this.  Probably same old tricks coming from a Hillary again.  I am happy it’s happening to a dem though so they can get a taste of their own medicine and we can enjoy watching their mental gymnastics as they explain why “this is different.”
[comment]I don't get what all the fuss is about. BELIEVE Tara Reade? Not necessary; Biden has been stupid enough to grope little girls and touch their breasts in front of the camera. What more evidence do you need than something you can see with YOUR OWN EYES?
[comment]**SS / TLDR:**

7 more of the alleged 25 Biden accusers are named in this article
Seems like the [MSM](https://twitter.com/MZHemingway/status/1205544519548252160?s=20)/[#LameStreamMedia](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249506799532867585?s=20) are trying very hard to bury every story that surfaces about Biden's inappropriate sexual behaviour with women and children. The pedo-sympathizing liberal leftists will even take it a step further to have reporters removed and silenced for speaking on the matter. **Does the truth hurt that much?**

The Grand Jury charges:

INTRODUCTION

1\. Through its election laws
2\. LEV PARNAS
3\. LEV PARNAS and IGOR FRUMAN[comment]In short
This doesn't appear to have anything to do with Trump. These charges have nothing to do with donations to Trump's campaign. If the defendants assisted Guiliani's endeavors to investigate Biden[comment]I don't even know why this is news.  They got busted for illegal lobbying to start a weed business?  This does not seem worthy of anyone's attention.

[comment]Freeloaders are gonna freeload.
[comment]AOC lives rent free in the trumpanzes head! Love it!
[comment]Maybe she should have saved some of that bartending tip money.
[comment]I encourage everyone commented here to go back read the article. Seriously[comment]That’s really funny considering the Dems will fight for every bill that forces union members to pay dues even though members don’t agree with everything they stand for
[comment]Anyone else think Sanders is using her for protection if the DNC screws him again? What are the chances we see him run as a third party[comment]AOC is as far as she is going to go

[comment]r/politics only allows pro Bernie news hadn’t you heard?
[comment]Why do you browse r/politics everyday? All the posts and headlines are twisted and far from factual. Not to mention the bias.
[comment]You won’t see things like this because it doesn’t support the Lefts agenda or narrative. It’s very sad.
[comment]R/politics should be called r/militantleftwingbernienazis.  How they get to call themselves r/politics is beyond me.  I guess it's just more proof how twisted this platform (reddit!) Has become.
[comment]They all sound so immature on r/politics

They badmouth weight....hair ...looks...etc.

What has that got to do with politics
[comment]Correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t dems suppose to be for prison reform? If that’s the case it just proves you can’t do anything right
[comment]This was covered by CNN[comment]Every day? Why would you do that to yourself?
[comment]It’s not secret that r/politics is abhorrently liberal.  They often praise their fundamental bias over there.  Left that shithole echo chamber a longggg time ago
[comment]r/politics is literally g-guys t-trump is bad. p-please give me upvotes
[comment]wait
OK. So this is a thing he likes to do with pardons which appeals largely to the African-American community. Largely
Liberal media doesn't cover it because non-violent criminal offenders being let off the hook by gasp... Trump doesn't play to their rhetoric or overarching message. Conservative media doesn't cover it because criminals of any kind should be hammered out of existence
[comment]Pretty sure it's over 100 people now that kim Kardashian has worked with trump to get out of prison now
[comment]Just went on r/Politics and it’s just the left bashing on the right every chance and way they can get it. It’s really sad. The right is so unrepresented on Reddit[comment]Stores....... That's where you shop

[comment]That's kinda messed up. It's also shocking at how they are saying "should any of that change". Could you post the link to that article?
[comment]Can you sue them if they doxx you
[comment]There’s a great video on YouTube by meme historian called “the CNN skirmishes” that is about this
[comment]And it will never be mentioned again by the left
[comment]He should hope they do. If he doesn't get murdered[comment]I find it interesting that a bunch of adults at CNN went after this person for posting “offensive memes”. They might as well start taking down most of Reddit if that’s how they want to think. Also isn’t one of the biggest unwritten rules of the internet “if you don’t like it[comment]If you make fun of CNN they will doxx you and put your name and picture and address all over national tv and threaten you to get an apology because you are a threat to free speech...or something....

[comment]Liberals screaming “Obstruction!” are nowhere to be found.
[comment]Of course[comment]And just like all the others nothing will ever happen. Republicans are all weak
[comment]How about worrying about Flynn and a corrupt DOJ instead of the former administration
[comment]Oh my god!! 

Seriously can we just all move past the Obama shit? IT DOESN’T MATTER!! Nothing will ever happen to anyone. 

It’s done. 

There are so many more new fires so I don’t know why must we keep fanning the embers of this bygone administration? I’m so sick of seeing this all over the conservative/Republican subs. 

I’m sooooo bored with all the same talking points. I feel like it’s all any of us ever bitch about. 

Obama was President. WAS. Past tense. His administration did what it did. Past tense. 

It’s like a friend or coworker constantly talking about an ex. Sometimes we should just all heed the advice of a Disney song and Let it Go. 

Being a Republican/conservative is just so one dimensional any more.

[comment]Dr. Ferrer has a Bachelor of Arts in Community Studies from the University of California[comment]Unfortunately many
A very quick search shows she holds a few very applicable degrees to her job.

"She holds a doctorate in social welfare and masters degrees in public health and education."

She also has a team of dedicated people to assist with research and decision making. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not advocating for or against her decisions or policies. I do not know her[comment]I’m certain she was the best candidate.
[comment]The cryptkeeper
[comment]So an unqualified social worker is in charge of public health in LA County—that does explain a lot. And she certainly isn’t suffering any economic challenges from the lockdown or even encouraging thousands of junkies and crazies to live on the street.
[comment]You wonder why there is a problem.  You are looking at it right there.  Communist activists
"Communists never fix the problem they simply fix the blame and manufacture the problem. Because problems for communists are a fundraising opportunity and a political stage."
[comment]She’s a complete loon[comment]I imagine most county directors of public health aren’t doctors. I know my county’s isn’t. The salary of my county director is around $120K with a population of 170K. I don’t know how that translates to LA county.
[comment]That’s typical California for you.
[comment]And she looks like an extra from Supernatural.
[comment]She's a Dr. of Marxism. In California[comment]I'd say replace her with a cheaper model but her pension is probably more than her annual salary.
[comment]She makes more than the President of the united states. More than The Senate Majority leader and Speaker of the House combined...

Sounds fiscally responsible to me!
[comment]At least Newsom is golfing in Montana on vacation during all this...
[comment]Maybe she’s a Witch Doctor?  LOL

[comment]Every study I see about liberals and conservatives point to liberals having higher rates of neuroses
Also[comment]No shit. Thats because hubris is an extremely common replacement for facts and logic.
[comment]After reading the paper
Democrats both use more warmth words and fewer competence words when addressing minority audiences. Do they do this because they think minorities are stupid and are dumbing it down? Or do they do this because they want to express sympathetic emotions towards minorities (who they think have been oppressed in some way or another). 

While the findings of this paper are interesting[comment]Minorities are the MOST conservative people I've met. When I point out the similarities in their beliefs &amp; Republican ones[comment]I thank god theres a study to back my claim up.

[comment]They're not worried about her doing shit to Biden or Bernie. They're trying to keep the debate relevant and not have a loser candidate taking up a third of the air time. Not that she would actually get a third of the air time[comment]I actually really like and respect tulsi. She seems to be the only democrat that actually thinks for herself.

[title]WHO officials praise US leaders on coronavirus pandemic response: Trump is doing 'all he can'
[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/who-officials-praise-us-leaders-on-pandemic-response-trump-is-doing-all-he-can.html[comment]Don’t trust these WHO people one little bit.
[comment]Oh shut the fuck up[comment]Well heck[comment]Finally Democrats will hate the WHO like the rest of us
[comment]Concerning... considering WHO said the same thing about China[comment]You’ll never see this headline on r/coronavirus that sub is all anti Trump.
[comment]Not exactly a rousing endorsement considering the source[comment]Which just goes to show you what a truly awful job he’s done.
[comment]Too little[comment]Let's not pretend we like these guys all the sudden.
[comment]I'm shook. The China-backed WHO doesn't shame the US for a change?
[comment]As if the Chinese Health Order’s endorsement has any meaning.
[comment]Probably looking for a handout.

No you don't WHO...we won't get fooled again!
[comment]So... orange man isn’t bad?
[comment]World health organization = Chinese health organization. WHO -&gt; CHO
[comment]Hmm[comment]Lmao...  The WHO is so irrisponsible.. they suck..  it will be interesting because lefties love these people[comment]Ffs this sub was rightfully condemning WHO 5 minutes ago. You cant turn around and post shit like this just because it fits your narrative. This sub is dishonest af.
[comment]Not gunna see this posted in worldnews politics or any other sub
[comment]You mean[comment]I feel like the COVID19 response from the WHO is like Bush’s response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. (As the media portrayed it anyways)
[comment]Idk why we are all calling it WHO. It’s called CHO

She's guilty as sin[comment]What crime would that be? As long as she was not aware of the attack beforehand[comment]Mrs. Bill Clinton lied? Susan Rice lied? Obama bin Biden arrested and jailed a YouTube making man for blaspheming Islam and it was all for a lie? 

Color me shocked. I wish I could despise Democrats more than I do but I just can't.

This is not a liberal perception. I will never vote for a lib to raise my taxes and create the social welfare state[comment]What this means is her jumping in as Biden’s pinch hitter is much more difficult. No way she sees a day in jail though.
[comment]Throw the traitor in gitmo
[comment]Obama didn’t want a successful 9/11 anniversary attack by al qaeda to happen a couple months before the presidential election so they delayed the counter strike response so the clock could tick to 9/12 and then blame the attack on a YouTube video so to take away the terrorist attack narrative
[comment]Obama didn’t want a successful 9/11 anniversary attack by al-qaeda to happen a couple months before the presidential election so they delayed the counter strike response to think of a plan while the clock ticked away and then they blamed the attack on a YouTube video so to take away the al-qaeda narrative and report on 9/12 saying  it was angry rioters

[comment]This meeting needs to be deleted for the npc's[comment]I must say I’ve seen Republicans get desperate but this one might just take the cake
[comment]This is not “collusion”. This is the President explaining that his actions are constrained by appearances during an election. 

“Collusion” is more like soliciting and accepting assistance from a foreign country in winning an election. 

Granting concessions to an adversary (like releasing their seized assets) in exchange for the things we want (like freezing their nuclear weapons program) is called “diplomacy”.

Nice try[comment]Yep. 
Obama. 
US history's worst president.
[comment]Oh - and BTW that’s not Putin.
[comment]Buttttttttt!!!! Obama gonna pay my bills!!!
[comment]Wow
[comment]Amazing this seems to be a revelation for some.   Completely dismissed by the US media.
[comment]Keep dreaming folks while our current leader acts like a clown and you all know it. Stop this foolishness.  Trying to look back and all. What was done is done. Deal with the now and right now our country is in trouble and it's not the Dems..
[comment]Is there any video evidence of this or are we just going to stick whatever subtitles we like on a bunch of photos of a meeting.

[comment]Best of luck with that. The citizens of California will somehow turn a blind eye to their own government and blame Trump.
[comment]This guy is such a massive piece of shit
Investigating oil companies because of ‘artificially high’ gas prices. HE’S THE ASSHOLE THAT SINGED THAT GAS TAX INTO LAW. 

Blaming the fire issues in CA on ‘a failure of capitalism’ when it’s absolutely the fault of democratic legislation (save the trees) and poor government management (no controlled burns or forestry clearing). 

This guys ignorance and bravado knows no bounds. He’s very dangerous and I hope we can get rid of him because he’s hell bent on turning this state into a communist shithole

[comment]Racism is a belief that members of a particular race are inferior PURELY because of their race. 

IMO even thinking that a culture is inferior is ok
This isn’t even that. It’s literally naming a virus for where it came from.
[comment]The "Chinese" subreddits are going all out to deflect this virus as a Chinese occurrence and turn it into a "US Bio-weapon".

So something fishy is going on.

You pay yourself in business with stock options so even charging billionaires billions a year would be impossible without them liquidating positions. I bet that one would go to the Supreme Court. 

What I’m getting at is we will pay for it. The middle class will pay for it when they charge their model 3s and now they’re paying taxes on electricity. You will get a meat tax for being a meat consumer. Your taxes will also be at minimum 70%. Inflation will push them closer to 90%. The only people who will benefit are those bureaucrats in Washington and those who don’t work/aren’t in high brackets to begin with. Oh yeah like I mentioned: inflation will pay for it bigly. She’ll be dead by the time that hits the masses though as it takes years for people to let it sink in. They will destroy our economy and buy it piece by piece to grow their bureaucracy. The reversal of perestroika lol. 

This goes for all candidates specially your beloved Yang.

4) Increase taxes on the "next of the rich"

5) Destroy the Middle Class in the process.

6) Reduce the economy to ashes and continue to blame everything but yourself as at fault.

7) Continue to run for office on the idea that everything is a right and should be freely provided by the government now that nobody can afford anything.

8) Be elected for life for having destroyed any economic opportunity

Want to investigate Biden? Go through the proper channels. Don't ask Ukraine or China to do it and don't ask him to testify at your own trial about his own crimes. That's just idiotic.

[title]The Great U.S.-China Divorce Has Arrived - Make no mistake: The global struggle with China is about to go to the next level. Or two. Or three. the Chinese Communist Party’s reprehensible behavior crossed the last line[selftext]https://nationalinterest.org/feature/great-us-china-divorce-has-arrived-146177[comment]Thank you President Trump for MAGA!
[comment]Written by Bill O'Reilly

China’s Bio weapon
Well
Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren’t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand 
The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy
Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses “models” too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would “level the economic playing field” and not have fired a shot.

Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China’s own doctors attempted to sound the warning
Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything.

I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier. We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this.

But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the “room” and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field.

Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn’t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a “war” President. He is.

But now on not one but two fronts. One front is the virus and the other front is the Chinese. While the Saudi’s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren’t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field.

But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He’s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I’m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again
We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday’s statements she made were truly appalling and the lowest of low. I didn’t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation.

But
We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party) are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people
After he spoke 
The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well
It’s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for God’s blessing on our nation. But

[comment]Good for us[comment]Yea until Trump is out of office and the next Democrat president will fold and say its good for America
[comment]Meh[comment]I've been saying it for a while now. Until China wants to start honoring their agreements and fairly trading with the world they have no right to be in the free and open market.
[comment]At least the CCP/PRC has Hollywood[comment]Let's stop pretending that we're breaking up with them because of some higher moral standard.

Wages have more than tripled in China over the last decade. It is significantly cheaper to manufacture in India or Southeast Asia. It's actually cheaper to manufacture in parts of Europe than it is in China. 

Companies around the world are leaving China
China is trying to move on from manufacturing and into the tech sector
AND THEY'RE GETTING THEM.

Apparently whether or not a woman has been raped is based solely on politics. When a street thug rapes a woman[comment]Biden is going to get stabbed in the back by his own party eventually. That’s why they’re letting this fester in the background. This is a sword of Damocles over Biden’s head that is barely hanging on.
[comment]If the Republicans are okay with a candidate with dozens of sexual assault allegations[comment]Ha
[comment]It really is. The fact that they’re not even trying to discredit her and just flat out ignoring it is a contradiction I wouldn’t even expect from the left.
[comment]Liberals just straight up ignore it. I haven’t even seen them try and justify it. They just don’t talk about it and pretend it isn’t real.
[comment]This can't be a surprise? par for the course.
[comment]Just goes to show you the #MeToo movement is a farce. Certainly discredits any woman who actually has been assaulted.
[comment]The real reason we had to lock every woman and prepubescent child in America in their homes and fine anyone not staying 6 ft. apart was to keep them safe from Joe. Biden is the true virus

I think it might be prudent to verify this source before jumping on the "well duh" bandwagon. Otherwise[comment]Remember: Self loathing projects.

I’m willing to listen. I’ve been a republican since Bush Jr. and only switched about 3 days ago. I follow this sub BECAUSE I want to understand both sides. I’m not here to argue or troll. 

The only real message I got from your last post is that you think I’m dishonest and unintelligent since you made sure to mention that several times. You’ve already made your mind up and no matter what I say you will dismiss it because ultimately you believe that I am your enemy. I’m sorry that my last post upset you so much to go as far as insult me personally over an issue that affects us all. I will definitely keep my opinions to myself next time.

We don't let China make our tanks and warships for us. Why do we let China make our computer hardware and software for us. You can't have a secure computer network when are computers are made in China.

Yeah this will never happen this country depends on cheap products from China

[comment]Wall Street needs to cooperate. Until the greedy hedge fund managers buy in[comment]The only way this will work is if it were tied to national defense; however
The only way I can see this actually working would be to set up something similar to the Maritime Subsidy Board with the various makers of articles deemed critical to national defense then these factories would be subsidized to run in the country.   Setting this up could be seriously abused.
[comment]I was hoping all this was going to wake America up and cut the ties with China!
[comment]sanction china
[comment]And the U.S. media will fight us all the way.
[comment]At this point I dont know anymore. China has demonstrated to the world that its far better at tackling crises like this. Almost the entire western world has failed to take this virus seriously. 

Even with all the secrecy and stalling china did at the start its still handled the situation better. Even if their figures arent entirely true (which is probably the case) theyve still done a better job. 

From a purely pragmatic standpoint wed be better off being run by china in this case. Really dissapointing how democracy has fucked this one up.

But without a doubt in my mind....if Trump said this there would be marches and protests across the country.

[comment]This is the Democrats strongest candidate.....

When Hill took the seat blue the Democrats spent over 8 million to get her there versus the roughly 2.5 mil the Republicans spent on Knight.

[title]Nobel Prize-winning scientist shares COVID-19 data showing strict lockdowns were an overreaction
[selftext]https://www.theblaze.com/news/nobel-prize-winning-scientist-shares-covid-19-data-showing-strict-lockdowns-were-an-overreaction[comment]Like Sweden?
[comment]There are plenty of places that did not implement strict lockdowns. Then after tens of thousands of people started dying they changed their minds.
[comment]I personally feel there are two major contributing factors for why we’re still in lockdown.  

1.) People (government officials and those who support their elected representatives) are afraid to admit they were wrong about this. 

They went into panic mode based off flawed
A response was needed and a response was given. 

But since then new data continuously pours in showing that the early models were wrong... that the 3% is far far far lower.  That by panicking
We have lost faith in our governing bodies. 


That’s a huge mistake that nobody wants to say they were wrong on. But again
So in hopes of finding a way to justify this; they press on... they will keep saying that the methods are working.  The new data will be dismissed as flawed or from people who are more worried about golf than human lives. We will hear that the curve was flatted because of the measures taken and not because there wasn’t impending curve to be afraid of to begin with. We’ll have fear pounded into us about waves two and three that are supposed to be coming up in the fall and winter... and for what? Because we have fear of being wrong?

Can we blame them though?  In today’s society
Someone smarter than me once said something to the effect; “Respect is earned when watching how a man handles their losses and triumphs”

2.) The other contributing factor? Some people (Civilians and such) genuinely love this “Pandemic”. Whether they love the free money that’s coming to them.. or the excuse to not go out... or the “likes” they get for showing how creative they are with quarantine. Or the ability to work from home... They love the excitement and drama that comes with this new way of life.

We have become a society that feeds off drama and victimhood. 

We have a long road to go to put this behind us.

 In California they stamp out all wildfires that used to occur naturally and would clean all dead tinder. Now there is a considerable amount of tinder due to fire control measures which makes any fire now much more devastating.
[comment]We’ll only truly know when this is over by comparing types of lockdowns and death rates. This should be easy to see since each state is sort of doing their own thing.
[comment]He better not post that to Facebook[comment]His Nobel prize is in chemistry and he is a structural biologist. He doesnt study Epidemiology. People who actually do have shown that the lockdowns have been beneficial. Just because someone has a Nobel prize doesnt mean that they are qualified to advise in all areas of science.
[comment]CNN: Mad scientist says your grandma doesn't deserve to live.
[comment]Where's youtube to block this guy?
[comment]He makes a very good point about the extreme lockdowns
It’s a very complicated issue to balance our economic needs with our health needs and this will still be a major issue going forward regardless of the pandemic if we don’t improve how we do things.

The modern way of life we enjoy in the west has been exported all around the world
The economic incentives and lack of strict oversight by the government allowed the free market to flourish. You wouldn’t have a system so well oiled like Amazon without it for example
The western way of life is strongly based on personal freedom and choice
More global needs from the economy than real input in the economy and this is not even inputing the cost in raw materials
..the sad fact is that there simply isn’t enough raw materials and economic sustenance to have billions of people living “the dream”. 

I think now that the question of scarcity is seriously raised during this pandemic with possible food shortages
It is clearly that this system cannot remain unchanged as we will be forced to change our focus.

We need to be more efficient
This will bring back the freedom of life we all wish for: healthy<|startoftext|>

The fact that Republicans have to fight Democrats in formerly extremely conservative districts in red states that Republicans count on for national elections while Democrats can literally run anyone in blue states or even just firmly established blue districts in red and purple states and put no money into the race to win overwhelmingly is a tragedy and definitive proof that this country will die very very soon.

Republicans need to understand that their strategy is not working anymore. You have to fight Democrats on their turf and push THEM out. Work to destroy the Democratic leadership

We can either admit the truth or continue this charade.  All of  is know right from wrong.  Our President did what he was accused of. Je was impeached. AMD we are afraid that more witnesses could rest in his removal which in my opinion if hes guilty then he should be. Not that may hurt some feelings on here but grow up. Hes not the only one who could lead the party. I think it's time we stop bashing the other side and realize it's up to us. We can find another champion I promise. They are waiting for a chance to lead but we keep running them away when we wont acknowledge wrongdoing. Sorry but trying to offend those who eat at his table but my conscience is clear. Attack if you wish but I wont be a part giving Sam the right to do what he wants. Did you here the defense his lawyer gave. I'm offended . UnAmerican and not why I served this country

[comment]Ok then.
[comment]Forget out Biden. Biden is not on trial
[comment]Just because I dont agree with you about who's corrupt only one is running the country. If Biden is corrupt people shouldn't vote for him. Simple.  Same with Trump.
[comment]You people act like trump is a god. Silly
[comment]We controlled both houses of government when he was in office so enough with the bull. We could've investigated him then. What's the bfd now?  We know he did it. Senate will not remove so let's just move on. Hopefully we can put all this behind us one day.

[comment]Funny
Hopefully they and the turks have a good time together
[comment]No. The disarray comes from believing that Turkey is attacking peaceful Kurds.

This is NOT the case.

The corrected information and the official reporting from Syria and other countries
Notice that no Syrian ally is saying anything about it. If Syrian Kurds and/or SDF were being attacked by Turkey
The truth of the matter
The media mob ran with the original reporting because it looked like something that could be added to the "Things to call Trump out about" list. But
Turkey has not attacked Syrian Kurds or the SDF. Syria has denied the reports saying otherwise and they have no reason to lie about it.

I'm going off of information from this interview by Liz Wheeler at OAN:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aPkR8lrtLU.  If that information is incorrect
Honestly
To add a little more to the discussion or to just throw my opinion out there:  I don't think Pelosi ever intended to deliver the articles to the Senate.  The strategy that her party is going for is that every Democrat running for a seat in the House and the Senate are going to be stating that Trump has been impeached and that they (the Democrats) are the only ones who had the courage to stand up to Trump and take him down.  The second talking point the Democrats are going to try is that Trump would be removed from office[comment]I think that there should be a trial regardless.

[comment]Why is it important for conservatives that climate science be “fake news” ?

So again- why is it so important for climate science to all be “fake news”?
[comment]Not you. Her. “You’ve stolen my future”. There are equally plenty of “we are already doomed” articles and Congressmen claiming the world is going to end in ten years.
This is a bunch of crap. If climate change is that critical we can remove CO2 from the ocean
Energy efficiency standards have actual payback periods and can be easily implemented. Redeploying the entire hydrocarbon infrastructure in 20 years is simply absurd and will cost millions of lives. New CO2 emissions won’t. In fact<|startoftext|>

[title]Georgia state Democrat backs Trump for reelection[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-state-democrat-backs-trump-for-reelection-draws-partys-wrath[comment]I live in Dekalb County where this guy works.  I'm on some FB pages....all way blue
He's getting torn up.

This is an actual post by a black woman on a page I am a member of:  


**This might get deleted:**

**Try not to get mad with what I am about to say. But somebody has got to say it.**

**As a member of the Democratic Party and a person who has always volunteered as a political campaign organizer
**Honest conversation. This is for the black folks in the back of the room. Or the front of the room. Or wherever you are sitting. Let’s keep it real! When we go to vote we look at the ballot and ask ourselves two questions: 1. Are they black? 2. Is this definitely a Democrat? And for many that is enough to get the vote. TIME OUT FOR THAT!**

**We have allowed the most self serving scum to move from one position to another in our local and state elected positions. And do you know that the only reason that they keep tainting every position they occupy — because they are black and they know black folk will vote for them no matter what!**

**Black skin you win! Damn all that! Black communities need representation that understands “us.” I believe in FUBU like most of you but we have got to have some standards! Self preservation in a growing and crawling urban gentrification sprawl is going to take strategy.**

**Look at VJ! Pro-Greenhaven? Pro-Trump? FROM DEKALB? Elected by black Georgia and you got the nerve? All the unethical history! My God! No wonder! He can do it like that- do the folks in that put you where you stand! Why? Because the black skin gets you in!**

**To the black folks in the back
**We want black leaders in our black communities but my God we have got to know when to take out the TRASH!**

**Let’s handle the business of our community y’all.**

**If anyone is offended I am sorry. This post is directed directly at FUBU.**

Evidently she came back from her vacation and told Schumer to kill the bill which he promptly did. Exactly when did Pelosi become a senator?? Maybe someone can fill me in on this.

Edit: [see this for more details.](https://youtu.be/Un-DdiDJFns)

Edit2: See Ingrahm tonight with Senator Braun. This does seem to be the case - Pelosi killed the bill.

Lol
[comment]I agree with the president and I think the Democrats who are awake can see that too.

[comment]That's not saying much.
[comment]Come November
Will you trust Biden or Sanders with that job?
[comment]There are a lot of institutional power players who have a lot of money invested into Biden who are going to call in favors owed to them when that empty vessel gets in (that’s their hope and they won’t just toss that aside). Cuomo is harder to control and doesn’t owe the same people in the same way. Don’t forget[comment]I’m a stronger Democratic presidential nominee than Joe Biden. And I’m a Republican.
[comment]Personally I prefer that Trump gets an easy win and can focus more of his time on running the country. Cuomo should just stick to governor

[comment]No he isn't. New Yorkers aren't even generally fond of him. He has no real appeal outside of the city. He has no ability to draw any rust belt votes to him.

Hell[comment]Honestly he's right
[comment]Who was Joe Biden again?
[comment]I don't think Cuomo is competent. He talks like a tough guy (with the personal beliefs of a pussy) and that is about all he has going for him. He hasn't handled his state well during the crisis and he never ran it well before today. Just what has this guy done to deserve more TV time than other governors???

I'll let the authors speak for themselves though
[Link to original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12516)

Quote from abstract:
&gt; The results show evidence of systematic racial bias in all datasets
Quote from paper conclusions:
&gt; Our results demonstrate consistentsubstantial racial biases in classifiers trained on all
five datasets. In almost every casetweets are classified as sexismfirst experiment may be driven by underlying differences in the rates at which speakers of different dialects use particular words and phrases associated with these negative classes in the training data. For example
fifteen times as frequently in the black-aligned
corpus compared to the white-aligned corpus. Howeverdisparities tend to persist even when comparing
tweets containing keywords likely to be associated

with negative classes. While some of the remaining disparities are likely due to differences in the
distributions of other keywords we did not condition on

[comment]Didnt read the article but I'd assume the AI recognizes words like "nigga" as hate speech. So it would make sense why we would come up as the worst offenders. It also could be because the slightest instance of "hate speech" from other demographics is silenced or banned or deleted and hateful things like "white people are stupid" are socially accepted and not regarded as hate speech[comment]It's funny how Democrats and liberals care about minorities as long as the minorities aren't white people.
[comment]Probably just tagging every N-word as hate speech.

[comment]How does this relate to the Republican Party though?

I've had several unfortunate conversations with truly deluded liberals who are still so deranged as to think that the IG report confirms wrongdoing on the part of the Trump campaign and exonerates the FBI.  The left is simply too mentally ill to reason with anymore.  History is going to look back and say that Trump Derangement Syndrome was a real variation of mass hysteria.

[comment]Didn't Trump say Obama shouldn't get credit for killing Bin Laden
I don't see how this is different.
[comment]I think this is just pushback due to trump saying Obama shouldn’t get credit for killing bin laden.
[comment]Fist
Second: this asshat was truly a modern day hitler; he was dedicated to genocide of several ethnic groups in the middle east. He wasn't just killing non-muslims
He was the polar opposite of our sitting president[comment]Democrats always seem to find something completely absurd to blame Trump for. It's going to be hilarious to see the liberal tears fall when he gets elected again  haha.
[comment]There are two groups dedicated to the destruction of America. ISIS and the left.
[comment]Is this retaliation because trump back in 2012 tweeted that Obama didn’t kill Bin laden it was
the navy seals?
[comment]So pathetic. And sad.
[comment]Does it really matter though? I dont really care who gets credit[comment]Honestly
I don’t think it’s special Bin Laden was killed under Obama’s administration[comment]“for pursuing policies that made the fight against ISIS harder”

[title]I'd like to get a vote going. Are other Republicans okay with decriminalizing cannabis? Supposedly it will lower crime too. Should Trump do this before the election next year?

[comment]Never smoked weed I'm my life[comment]I don't mind if we decriminalize it
Yeah[comment]If you want a slam dunk win[comment]Wttf are conservatives conserving if you do
[comment]I’ve wanted it decriminalized for decades.
[comment]I mean I support ending any form of government overreach. 

except there’s no way I’m giving the Democrats anything without them fighting with blood sweat and political tears for it first. Make them earn it.
[comment]Yes.

Would help election chances too.
[comment] [https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/)
[comment]Absolutely.  This would cement 2020 for Trump.
[comment]Yes.

Conservative friends
There is no reason it should be illegal according to our own government research (Schaefer Report).

It is not a gateway Drug
Weed was made illegal solely based on racism because Nixon was a bit of a racist.

Legalize it
I recommend checking out "Weed the People" it is a fantastic book that clearly outlines all the points I made above and much more.
[comment]We should decriminalize it at the federal level[comment]Pushing a full blown federal legalization would be a very smart move for him. It would put democrats in a very uncomfortable position as they like to oppose for the sake of opposing
As far as lowering crime...as long as any black market exists[comment]I'd have to say yes. I'm against recreational drug use in general[comment]Rules for thee
Just as bad as the democrats
[comment]The fact its illegal hasn't stopped me or anyone I know. The government should really give in on this one.
[comment]You mention that it will lower crime[comment]I don’t know I’m on the fence about this I’ve seen weed make people lazy but then I’ve also seen it do great things for people. I’ll have to do more research on it.
[comment]Each state should be able to vote for legalization. But it should decriminalized at the federal level. I am a huge trump supporter and a health care professional. I would love to see cannabis explored for medical research. I think cannabis would have huge pharmaceutical benefits. We need to research the medical value of cannabis.
[comment]Yes please. Its mostly boomer conservatives and hard right people that do not want it legalized because they listened to DARE too much lol
[comment]I feel like he would lose a lot of the boomer vote doing this...

[title]Why are you Republican (and others)?
[selftext]Although I am not AmericanIt’s not ok to teach children being gay is ok
Aborting a baby because you cannot take responsibility for your actions it not only immoral and tragic but it sets the belief that ppl don’t have to take responsibility with life.

Economics are simple
We want energy independence because being independent gives you peace of mind and the ability to not be held hostage at the negotiating table.

Being a Conservative nationalist is being pro American tradition[comment]I'm not one. I've simply pledged my support for them until after the 2022 mid terms because they align with what's important in my view in politics as of right now. I suppose I am one temporarily.

If I were a one issue voter
There are other issues that they align with me too these days
Also there's the history thing. I'm kind of weary of supporting a political party that declared independence and fought a war so they could continue to enslave people based on race[comment]I think you may find a pretty wide range of opinions on this. As for me
1) Strongly believe in free enterprise
2) Strongly believe in the freedoms outlined in the constitution...1A and 2A critically
3) Stay out of foreign wars
4) Reduce government spending/programs
5) Support individual freedom but also personal responsibility and rule of law. Oppose identity politics
6) Stop illegal immigration
7) Not that religious
The Republicans haven't always scored well on these in the past
I'd also say that Democrats appear to simply have gone completely insane
So again[comment]I’m Republican because everyone can’t be on welfare.
[comment]Because I like to eat[comment]I’m a Republican because at the age of 13 I realized that feminism
I’m a Republican because liberals tried to put me in boxes. They tried to assign me ways of living based off the fact that I am a straight

Trump although no one agrees with everything he says
On Policy Trump is almost perfect
From veterans to tradeFrom asking the UN to pay more
The economic policy’s of Trump are in line with Ronald Reagan
The media hates Trump because he attacks him[comment]GOP needs to win back the culture war
The left has it in their pocket
We are racist we hate immigrants it’s ridiculous the the party that ended slavery
They are even pushing economic policy’s which would bring the down fall of our economic system. 

Capitalism built the richest most powerful country in the history of the world.

Socialism in theory sounds nice... and maybe in several hundred years when technology is to the point it might actually work[comment]I think republicans as a whole are going to what keeps our country from going down the shit hole. Take a look at LA California. Shit on the streets[comment]Why I am a Republican? You might not know our political system but I am for Federalism. We have states which are like small countries. I want the Federal government to handle foreign policy and national defense while the states handle everything else. If my vision of politics where the law
What's the future of the Republicans short term. It depends. American are not ideological. If the economy continues doing will[comment]Why a Republican?

Because they don’t celebrate and promote the killing of babies
&gt; The phrase "life unworthy of life" (in German: "Lebensunwertes Leben") was a Nazi designation for the segments of the populace which[comment]It's democrats in general
I'm hearing leftists say psychologists are now saying "speech can be considered physical assault".

For example as a Trump supporter
Not a world I want to live in.
[comment]Though I am a liberal... I have no attacks to make[comment]I'm a moderate independent and disagree with a number of Trump's policies[comment]I just want to point out that since on a practical level the US has a two party system[comment]I am a moderate moreso than a republican but I align with right leaning beliefs moreso. I feel that the Republican Party needs to progress a bit more. I feel that in the last few years the party has gone a lot further to the right and the democrats have gone further to the left leaving the moderates no choice but to figure out where they really align. 

I think republicans needs to realize there is nothing wrong with Gay marriage (we need more love in the world)
Immigrants should have to come here legally and do it the right way as everyone else does. But holding some of these people hostage in camps on the border isn’t exactly right. It might seem that I am coming off in a more liberal meaning
I can’t stand how far left the democrats have gone with the very little border security and how some of them want no borders at all. I can’t vote for a democrat but I’ll listen to a moderate democrat all day. I can’t listen to Warren or Sanders.

[comment]Well if that's the case John can I borrow just a little bit of money.
[comment]So I guess a 150 BILLION wire transfer and 3 BILLION in cash is just a “little bit or money”. That’s cool[comment]So according to the comments it’s between 1 and 180 billion.

Can’t say message board rumors don’t inform you with the best info!

He must be jailed.

[comment]Stupid comment in the article stating even the liberal judges understood the importance of protecting the borders. It’s not the job of the Supreme court to decide what’s good or bad for the country. The  Supreme Court’s job is to rule according to the law.  If they were charged with doing what was best for the country[comment]not surprised it was sotomayor.  major TDS.

[comment]It would be nice if he actually did his job and gave federal aid to the states instead of saying that governors have to be nice to him first before the states get aid.  But I guess it's easier to try and dunk on the libs instead of being honest and realizing that Trump bungled the response to the coronavirus.

[comment]This article doesn't represent the CDC publication accurately
The article says the CDC claims 0.4% case fatality and 35% asymptomatic. This is the CDC's _best guess_ scenario (not the lower estimate). This would indicate 0.28% infection fatality rate (0.4% * (1 - 65%))

Big oil wants us to keep using plastic bags because  they make so much money off them. Watch Broken Recycling sham on Netflix...
[comment]I'm conservative and I hate this. Plastic bags have done horrible damage to many ecosystems. The desire to eliminate them from production is not just a liberal desire.

[title]Why Are Rioters ‘Brave’ but Coronavirus Protesters a Health Hazard? There’s a double standard in how protesters are treated.
[selftext]https://spectator.org/why-are-rioters-brave-but-coronavirus-protesters-a-health-hazard/[comment]It’s because of what they are protesting.  Coronavirus protesters are mostly privileged and they are protesting valid measures that are meant to protect their community because they are impatient.  George Floyd protestors are protesting the on going institutional murder of African American people at the hands of a broken system.  No one thinks the rioters are brave.
[comment]rioters/looters absolutely were not exercising social distancing and destroying small businesses who were already suffering financially.
[comment]\#The\_narrative
[comment]The coronavirus is not real
[comment]I think Brave is the wrong word even for their characterization of themselves.
[comment]Because one was about protesting your right to have your hair done and the other was protesting your right not not get killed for being black.
[comment]Coronavirus protestors are ignoring basic humanity and risking the lives of innocent elderly and at risk individuals. BLM protestors are advocating the freedom to exist. The standard is the same; covid protesters don’t meet the bar. Nobody should be outside or gathering right now. These curfews are the most anti-American practice I’ve ever seen.
[comment]Because the rioters’ cause has the liberal seal of approval.
[comment]probably because police brutality is SERIOUS and innocent people are being killed because of it. unlike quarantine[comment]Television ratings
[comment]This isn’t a double standard racism isn’t being an idiot racism is an active problem while you guys are protesting something that kills people and you want it to basically kill more people while the rioters are protesting their rights and so that they don’t get killed

Making kids think that one party can only work with their own party is not only wrong[selftext]https://i.redd.it/6mkwps26yaq41.jpg[comment]Because he’s a Democrat. And it’s clearly a question directed towards how he can unite democrats. That’s the question. Chill lol
[comment]Probably should have put this. Our Governor is a Democrat. He sucks and I do not like him at all. Probably also should have said he is in 8th grade. My issue is the teacher is basically saying the our democrat governor can only work with other Democrats. There are more questions on the assignment that are just like it but less annoyingly biased.
[comment]You should reach out.
[comment]Don’t let this pass. It’s time these people hear us.

[comment]It is the Chief of Party
HOWEVER

He should answer it something like this :

The chief of party should rally Democrats to work across the aisle with Republicans in order to form a unified front and increase organization.
[comment]The point of that section is the role of "chief of party" aka working within your own party to create a unified response. This doesn't mean it's not possible to work across the aisle[comment]It reads like the different roles of the Governor
I don’t know. I don’t find the questions to be offensive if I’m interpreting the picture correctly.
[comment]It's happening in the colleges too[comment]Does it involve wearing black face?

[comment]So far he’s innocent but these new things that are coming out are really making it look bleak.
[comment]I'm not a Biden fan by no means[comment]I recall the dems said we should listen to all women no matter what. Then a lady accused kavanaugh and every single thing she cited that could be checked fell through. All her friends said it didn’t happen and she couldn’t even remember when or where or how it happened but we had to listen to her. Now Tara Reade is accusing Biden and everything coming out verifies the legitimacy of her story and the dems have turned against her. Dems are pro rape period. They only use rape for political purposes and don’t give a crap about a real rape if it doesn’t have positive political ramifications for them. They are mentally sick.

The whole think seems like a carefully choreographed show where everyone can look strong while they do something that might make them look weak.  Perhaps Soleimani was the driving will beyond Iranian ambitions in Iraq and someone with personal ambitions and domestic goals could gain from his death.

[title]FBI spying is a far bigger scandal than the Trump impeachment
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/fbi-spying-is-a-far-bigger-scandal-than-the-trump-impeachment[comment]I have a pessimistic view of this. Most people take it for granted that they are being surveilled and don't care as long as they get their iphones. It's only when rights are taken away do they wake up. So[comment]This was a coordinated effort.

Nelly Ohr who worked for Fusion GPS was funneling information to her husband Bruce Ohr DOJ attorney who was then supplying it to the FBI.

Their daughter Kelly Ohr works for Buzzfeed news who along with Yahoo news broke the story that the investigation had begun into Trump. 

This was a collective effort by the Dems and bad faith actors. They lie for any political advantage and have done nothing but kept people down or mislead them.

When they say Russia influenced an election I have to agree but what they did was far worse. If not for Trumps win this would have never been exposed and they would continue as such.

Thank you Trump for making everyone a civics major and firing those FBI agents who needed to go.
[comment]Thanks GWB [comment]I agree. The politicalizaton of our intelligence agencies is shocking and wrong as well as illegal. President Trump continues to expose government corruption.
[comment]FISA court abuse has been a long standing problem for our intelligence agencies and it needs to be fixed. That doesn't come close to covering up impeachment for me though.

[title]Why the Left Calls Good People Racist
[selftext]https://amgreatness.com/2020/02/25/why-the-left-calls-good-people-racist/[comment]It's a derangement commonly known as *Projection*...Feminists are known by this behavior.
[comment]How can you spot racism
Someone said projection[comment]“...truth is not a left wing value...”. This is so evident when trying to have discussions on real topics. It makes it so difficult[comment]Because you can't prove a negative.  You're a murderer!  Now[comment]Why the right calls racists good people. 
This is another generalizing statement that has a splash of truth and taken to the extreme. 

We need to stop having each side look at the extreme minority if the opposite side. 
Our brains love to remember controversy and things we hate over the moderate and minor disagreements. 

All media outlets are rewarded by spreading and fueling controversy on all sides.
[comment]This applies on both sides:

* The right can’t talk about immigration without being called racist
* The left can’t talk about healthcare reform without being called communists/socialists (not talking about Bernie here)

The problem is that there is no mainstream medium (to the best of my knowledge) where the left and right actually have reasoned
This is not just a US problem but a global problem.
[comment]Associative thinking. Racism in its historical origins was about what was agreed to be an injustice. The left simply adopted that the “racist” is always the bad guy
Many race related conflicts today are but conflicts of interest and not injustices of oppression. To win a conflict of interest[comment]Trying to discuss almost anything with a Hardcore Liberal is like walking on egg shells. They are (generally) emotionally immature so most topics trigger an excessively emotional response. It’s also very frustrating because I sense that they have no interest in learning anything[comment]They call you racist to make the conversation about who is less racist.  Pandering to black people is consistent with their big government[comment]It's also the reason Obama was never criticized[comment]Seen a bunch of Lib/Dem's calling people "old Boomer" and "ok Boomer" "die boomer" and worse a lot here on Reddit the past few months. Whats up with that?

My question is why do they need to make these names/labels up for everyone?

This is getting old. its seems discriminatory 

*#WalkAway from the democratic party*
[comment]I should have qualified my post with more “generally speaking” - yes[comment]Racism is about power relationships. Using your faction or group’s position of authority to oppress another based on perceived ethnicity.

By that operationalization most behavior deemed ‘racist’ isn’t really ‘racism’ — at least explicitly. For instance
I once had a white guy
My response: “do you *want* to?”

Americans need to stop using the word ‘racist’ every time they feel slighted. And Americans need to remind themselves sometimes that[comment]Because they are bad people.  Simple.

I think right here he attempted to kind of skirt the question by giving a pro "they did some things right"  and a con "look back and see where they could have done better". But we all know that China fucked up. They have a culture where having the presence of being successful is actually more important than being successful.
I'd be willing to bet that local leaders tried to hush the outbreak because they didn't want to look bad -even though they virtually have no control of when a virus springs into existence

[comment]**Here is the text for those who dont want to click the link**    

&gt;

&gt;“Travesty” is not a nice word. It usually is applied to gross perversions of justice
&gt;desired when he dropped it into an interview answer the other day in the breezy courtyard of the Department of Justice (DOJ).

&gt;His composed
&gt;Okay
&gt;The FBI has made plenty of mistakes
&gt;Is the AG’s assessment fair? The answer is entwined in his next statement: “Without any basis [the FBI] started this investigation into [Donald Trump

&gt;’s] campaign ... .”

&gt;Oops
&gt;and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe

&gt;did not have adequate legal reasons to open a case into the Trump campaign in the first place. The attorney general just confirmed that.

&gt;But wait a minute
&gt;Two things to keep in mind regarding that inconsistency.  

&gt;First
&gt;This would be like an FBI agent interviewing four subjects suspected of robbing a bank and
&gt;In fairness
&gt;Which leads to the second point: The AG is logically being briefed on the progress and findings of U.S. Attorney John Durham

&gt;’s investigation
&gt;Attorney General Barr communicates in a clear
&gt;Many in the media immediately sputtered that the FBI was certainly justified because Trump campaign third-stringer George Papadopoulos

&gt;told an Australian official
&gt;.  

&gt;The media may wish that Papadopoulos’s comment is sufficient justification to investigate a candidate for president
&gt;The biased
&gt;That is especially true in light of what the AG went on to say during his interview. He likened the Comey team’s inappropriate investigation and subsequent fallout to sabotage
&gt;The AG then ominously stated that he is not interested in simply receiving a “report” from Durham. He expects him to focus on possible criminal violations: “And if people broke the law
&gt;These are incredibly hopeful words to many Americans who have come to believe — after the 2008 Wall Street-driven financial collapse
&gt;This is an attorney general projecting an air of confidence
&gt;This is what the Durham investigation could well conclude: A group of people aligned with or sympathetic to one political party conspired to illicitly use the authorities of the FBI to besmirch the opposing party’s presidential candidate — and that every effort should be made to indict those who can be charged as a result.

&gt;If true

Biden isn’t a political rival[comment]15 indictments voted by bi-partisan efforts.
[comment]Such will be the rule of Democrats. Constitutional Rights set aside because they inconvenience Democrats in their quest to subjugate America.
[comment]Reasons they want to impeach:

1. Nobody is buying their Dem talking points any longer
2. Dem talking points are poisonous. Relaxed border3. Dems are professional victims4. Dems realizing they have no good platforms
5. Dems watchign Trump win on a global scale across economies
6. Dems realizing they have no good candidates
7. Dems losing power by siding with "woke culture" and feelings crowd and realizing that those people are not financially
The Dems have taking loss after loss[comment]This really exposes that the left is no longer bipartisan[comment]Clearly the democrats have an agenda to remove a republican president. But what is the actual defense for Trump? Can someone explain to me how they can justify him withholding money to get Biden investigated? Most of what I hear for a defense is that Liberals have an agenda or "get over it[comment]You Republicans  are all  assholes
[comment]I'd like to know how an investigation into an Arkansas land deal became an investigation into Clinton's sex life.

The Republicans also threatened to impeach Barack Obama for smoking in the Rose Garden (federal property). To pretend soliciting a bribe isn't an impeachable offense is ridiculous and nothing but partisan spin.

Trump made the President of Ukraine an offer he couldn't refuse.

Despite polls showing an increase in public support for impeachment removing the president is still only popular among those who already opposed the president.  Why might House Democrats never actually vote to impeach President Trump. House Democrats don't think they have sufficient political support in the country for impeachment.  Impeachment not only risks invigorating President Trump’s base but also most independent voters seem to have little appetite for impeachment.

[comment]I like how black liberals call Black conservatives Uncle Tom's. because they don't support the " people who have been fighting for them the entire time".

let's pretend for a second that liberals have been fighting for black people since 1965.

Trump has been fighting in office for black people for 3 years. And has accomplished more then liberals in 55 years.

So maybe black people just support success.

[comment]Of course they call him an uncle Tom [comment]Trevor Noah already called him the first African president of America but that wasn't a compliment.
[comment]The Democrat party has been the absolute worst thing for blacks people. It’s so sad most blacks people don’t see that and vote Democrat like sheep. I think trump is changing that because he wants all people to be successful
[comment]This is honestly stupid. TRUMP isnt black
[comment]Wasn't Uncle Tom the hero in that story?
[comment]The first black president was Dwight D. Eisenhower
[comment]Its the difference and how you see it. The dems way is to give handouts. Easy to see the help and the ways to take advantage of it. The result: a people who continue to be completely dependent and downtrodden but think they are getting what they want. 

The GOP way
So republicans keep getting called haters for not giving out free stuff while dems just keep trying to buy votes without making a real impact on communities.

So we are so focused on the today and tomorrow
Trump should not be focused on his ratings and the next election cycle and what the news is saying about him. He’s the president right now[comment]I think this is actually great. The press is so transparent right now that even the dumbest person in the US can see their agenda and the fact that they're biased as hell.

[comment]I am literally rolling on the floor laughing out loud (figuratively speaking)
[comment]That witch is graveling for a chance.  The Dems are stupid enough to fall for her spell again.
[comment]Then what's holding you back?

Hold a press conference in one of your Nehru jackets[comment]Seriously - I don't think she could get the nomination[comment]She's "obviously" delusional.
[comment]Still ugly.
[comment]If she could she would she can’t and she knows it.. Even libs are asking her to disappear on their pages..
[comment]Please run then Hillary.
[comment]No[comment]She has that senile craziness in her eyes. I think losing to Trump broke her.

I dare say any of the other candidates would be frothing at the mouth for a VP slot at this stage of the race however.
[comment]This witch. Can you imagine the state of the world would be if this hag won? Double up on wars. Double up on Government give aways. Double up on ignoring the constitution. It would be a complete shitshow. Bill would be in there trying out new interns. Chelsea would be making demands and stiffing the taxpayers with her "business" plans. The Clintons are corrupt crooks.

It’s like getting dunked on in the NBA and posting a video of yourself being dunked on.

Thanks[comment]Please let her try
[comment]Disclaimer
Screw Hillary Clinton. I didn't support her then and I don't support her now.

She was a flawed candidate.  The DNC made a huge mistake pushing for her to be the anointed one.  They drastically underestimated the amount of dislike that vast portions of the country had for her.  Some of that dislike was probably very justified
At any rate
She is simply to disliked by too many people.  Republicans and conservatives dislike her on policy and to
I dislike her because she is fake and entitled.  I hope she goes away[comment]I honestly think she could win. Think about it Hillary won the popular vote and lost the electoral vote because people wouldn't vote for her because they thought she'd win anyways but if she ran again all of the Hillary supporters would swarm the polls and we see the inverse of 2016.

What doesn't make sense is what is going through the minds of the DNC to nominate Biden even before any allegations became public. Boggles my mind as the climate alarmist Democrats don't even like him

Let them call their witnesses and bring it back when they've done their homework. Bernstein can eat a dick[comment]Negative.  The House has the sole power to bring charges against a president.  That means they have the sole responsibility of investigating those charges.  Collecting documents and witness testimony related to impeachable offenses is their job
There's also a few lies that need to be debunked here.  There was not a refusal by Republicans to call witnesses.  There was a refusal to call **new** witnesses unless there was a 1 for 1 agreement for Republicans and Democrats.  It was **the Democrats** who rejected that deal.  Republicans made the attempt to get a witness agreement.  But
That's the first lie.  The second is that past impeachment trials called witnesses.  This is only half true at best.  The way it's being pushed as a talking point is an outright lie.  Witnesses called in the Cilnton impeachment **were not new witnesses!**  They were witnesses that had already been placed under oath and given testimony to the lower courts and to the independent counsel.  They were **old** witnesses.  They were nothing at all like Bolton or Mulvaney who were never even subpoena'd.  

Bernstein an outright liar to begin with
And no[comment]Clinton didn't have actual witnesses. His impeachment was for something legit.
This was a sham. 

The shoe would never be on the other foot. The GOP has far to much dignity and respect for the framers to shred the constitution. We aren't children.
[comment]You're an idiot.
[comment]It's been clear from the night of the 2016 presidential election that democrats are simply unable to accept the results of the election.

They've kept congress locked up in investigation after investigation and the only real losers are the American people. Their elected servants have failed them.

With the 2020 election being 9 months away[comment]\-Obama let Mexican drug cartels buy guns in the US which have been used to kill Americans.  


\-Obama let Hezbollah sell drugs in the US which funded terrorists overseas. All because he didn't want to make Iran mad.  


\-Obama used the IRS to attack Conservative groups.  


\-Obama illegally spied on many reporters.  


\-Obama got Americans killed in Benghazi then tried to cover it up.  


\-Obama wasted trillions in stimulus money.  


\-Obama killed thousands in drone strikes. He even attacked a hospital that Doctors without borders was operating out of killing many people.

[title]The more you know
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/uteobtb6ytz31.jpg[comment]That's some lying about the scientific consensus right there. There were no credible scientific bodies saying that the ice caps were going to melt by 2010. I don't know about the others[comment]Just ignoring the issues with a meme is dangerous. Don’t negate serious problems just because liberals talk about them.

The more you know[comment]They said the fire on top my garage will spread to the rest of my house but then a commie pinko fire truck showed up and sprayed chemicals all over my house. Probably to turn the frogs gay! And now the fire not only NOT spread to the rest of the house but it put itself out COMPLETELY! Why Do wE PaY TaxES for socialists firemen!

[comment]Don't forget the American Medical Association's studies into the "Jewish Gene" and the national catalog they now have of us. =_=
[comment]A lot of these were cause we took action
[comment]I see you deleted my previous comment. For your information
As for this meme you are circulating
1960s: oil reserves will be depleted in 10 years.     Correct (if exaggerated): there were some wild predictions of resource scarcity which didn't happen.  The only correct point in the whole meme. 

1970s: prediction of ice age.  There were a few popular articles about this
1990s: Acid rain. No serious predictions that it would destroy all crops
1990s: Ozone layer.  Yup
2000s: Nobody seriously predicted that the ice caps would melt in 10 yearsFor a little perspectiveTowards the end of it he made some sensible and fair-minded remarks about how to evaluate whether climate change is happening. He pointed out that trying to measure global average temperature was hard and probably controversial - but that all climate models predicted temperatures to rise most at the poles.  He therefore remarked that it would be sensible to monitor polar temperatures and global sea level - two quantities measured in completely different ways by different groups of people - to monitor for changes.    
Well
In conclusion
Somebody actually constructed this meme.  I kind of wonder who and why.

[title]A 15-Year Sentence for Burning a Stolen Gay Pride Flag Is Not Justice
[selftext]https://reason.com/2019/12/20/a-15-year-sentence-for-burning-a-stolen-gay-pride-flag-is-not-justice/[comment]It’s absolute bull crap
[comment]But burning the American flag is considered protest.....
[comment]Al right look pushing this kind of fake narrative doesn't help republicans be better than the left. So let's clarify something.

1 He got 2 years for stealing propriety and arson
2 He got 5 years for stealing from a church
3 He got 10 years of aggravation for having a LONG list of past misdemeanors and problems with the law. I think he had like 8 or so.
[comment]I believe this would break the "unusual" part of the 8th amendment. The time given is excessive and disproportionate to the crime.
[comment]A big part of the reason was because he was a “habitual offender.” Still probably harsh but it’s worth having all the facts. A rush to judgement based on incomplete facts makes us no better than the left.
[comment]I've been hesitant to comment on this story
First
So[comment]I didn't read the article but judging from the comments it looks like another case of "narrow all charges down to the most controversial one and slap that on the title"

[comment]Been saying this for years. The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. When you outlaw guns
I killed an armed home invader inside my own home. Didn't go to jail for it. I saw someone in a parking lot pull a gun on someone once because the guy stole his parking space. I drew my gun and stopped him from killing the other guy. 

There's an extremely good reason why there's no school shootings in Texas. The teachers are licensed to carry concealed firearms. Nobody wants to walk into a building full of armed shooters
More guns in the hands of law abiding citizens = less crime. The fear of death is often greater than the desire to commit an unlawful act.  Period.

[comment]I suppose you learn your lesson trying to disrupt an echo chamber. I remember when I first joined Reddit and initially I didn’t dip my toe into the comments but certainly read what the typical recommended subreddits as I didn’t know better. r/politics and r/worldnews kept coming up even though I wanted a place where there was no politics involved. But as you go on you start to read these forums. The one I remember was r/politicalhumor who I learned quickly was a Trump bashing site just like the others. So I commented on a topic. Wow. I got voted down into oblivion because I somehow mentioned something that was logical and went against the grain. 

That’s when I started thinking for myself around politics and reading and understanding. I upvoted you wherever I could. Just also remember these Reddit’s doesn’t represent a majority of thinkers and a lot of information is bot driven and from overseas. 

The proof of all of this is in November when people vote. Democrats will spin anything and everything because this is election year and the news agencies are on their side. It’s a David and Goliath story. The few island Reddit’s that offer a glimmer of hope is like these subs. 

Keep at your opinions because they do count and it’s nice to watch their nerves break.

[comment]The scene in Office Space where Peter is trying to argue they aren't stealing keeps coming to mind.  "it becomes ours"  "how is that not stealing?"

[comment]Jokes on them[comment]Didnt your president make fun of a disabled guy on live tv? I dont know why youd keep these randoms to such high regard...
[comment]😂 lung cancer
[comment]Typical. Doesnt surprise me. These people are honestly sick. Sick in their beliefs and sick in theie minds. Pretty much the left in a nutshell over the last 3 years

[title]Ted Cruz self-quarantines after interaction with CPAC attendee who has coronavirus
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ted-cruz-self-quaratines-after-interaction-with-cpac-attendee-who-has-coronavirus[comment]Kind of weird how there’s a virus that targets older people (who typically vote republican) that’s spread to CPAC. I also though that the Missouri primary is coming this Tuesday
I’m genuinely hoping that no one gets hurt from this virus. I hope that Ted
I know there are a lot of people on the left that wish harm on political opponents and it’s really upsetting to think that.
[comment]Keeping Ted and Corona in prayer
[comment]So should I be worried about the virus or not? Last I remember hearing from Cruz and even the presidential was that it's basically just the flu and there is nothing to worry about?
[comment]Virus is getting closer to its intended target.
[comment]I can hear the left and the Democrats collectively cheering
[comment]Honestly I hate this guy. Glad Trump beat him and we didnt get stuck with this turd. Maybe he should just pray to jesus. Hes a faith man[comment]We should soon be able to harvest antibodies from Lion Ted and save the planet.
[comment]Also known as 'taking a break'.
[comment]But why??? It’s just the flu. Right ted?

[title]Bernie Wants Medicare for All for Coronavirus[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/nick-arama/2020/03/08/795454/[comment]I mean at least they are getting people tested can’t say the same here in the states.
[comment]Nobody can provide enough care. The only difference is that nationalized systems don’t prioritize the rich.
[comment]In other words let them die. Medicare for all equals healthcare for none. Wake up god damn it.
[comment]I'd love to see a study on this where countries with a market driven healthcare system stack up against a socialist healthcare system: rationing of care when supplies are low in socialist systems[comment]The NHS already is rationing care[comment]Obviously

[title]Is Chris Cuomo exaggerating his coronavirus symptoms? Claims to have lost 15 pounds[selftext]http://theculturechronicles.com/index.php/2020/04/03/is-chris-cuomo-faking-his-coronavirus-diagnosis-it-sure-seems-like-it/[comment]Who seriously expected the truth from Fredo?
[comment]Fredo needs ratings as his network sinks to the bottom so he'll say anything.
[comment]The last thing liberal elites want is for the coronavirus not to be that bad. Especially those liberal elites in the media who would like you to keep tuning in for updates[comment]His whole timeline is quite suspect.    At what point did he disappear from the stage?  When did he get tested?   When did his symptoms appear?   What was his period of self isolation while waiting for test results?   How did he get a test and a result as quickly as he did?
[comment]Typical lying Democrat
[comment]He is corrupt
[comment]IT’S A FLU. Tired of all this melodrama bs by the MM and dems. 
Don’t you think it’s convenient that this is all happening during Trump’s re-election year? It’s a transparent scam.
[comment]My niece and her boyfriend both are recovered from COVID 19. I think we can all agree symptoms vary[comment]So adorable you believe anything anyone on CNN says
[comment]It desperately wants to be the story[comment]He could be exaggerating but he could also definitely be having real symptoms and be “propped up” for his segments.

When I was doing makeup for tv - people inevitably get sick but you can’t stop production for 1 out of 200 cast and crew...you prop them up if they are on camera.  

Let them sleep in their trailers and about an hour and a half before they are due to be on set - a doctor will pump them full of appropriate meds and vitamins
Although chipping a tooth from shivering sounds a little fake.
[comment]Both Andrew and his brother Chris are both fucked up in the head[comment]Numbers dont lie these repub threads are doa. There are hardly anyone on here and most are brainwashed. Something i learned in the army if think u right and everyone else is wrong u are wrong. Learn from it if everyone is against wat u believe is right u need to reevaluate ur whole whole life.

[comment]This is sensational. This country has been split since before I was born with its two party system.
[comment]At what point do states see what is happening in Georgia and Florida and say “ok maybe opening back up is fine”?  

Wisconsin just did this past week. I’m interested to see our numbers in a month.
[comment]There are cities within those lockdown states that are rebelling though.
I live in Southern CaliforniaWe’re still opening up slower than we’d like[comment]tucker carlson is a joke[comment]Tucker's a flaming idiot
[comment]What a moron.
[comment]Well[comment]Free States and Slave States all over again.
[comment]Tucker Carlson. The same lad who went on a tirade about the possibility of hand shaking being done away with as if he was somehow being violated.

That Tucker Carlson? Why anyone pays attention to him or considers his opinion as credible or relevant needs to question their ability to tell good honest people from lying sacks of shit like he is.
[comment]This country has been split for a long time now. Love or hate the 2 party system (honestly I think it should have been a republican ran country from the start[comment]We just bought a home in the lovely free state of Arizona[comment]So nothin' new

[comment]This man has been in office since the 70”s if he hasn’t addressed racism or fixed it by now he never will and he obviously won’t try . And let’s not forget if you don’t for Biden You are not Black .
[comment]He would get votes if he pissed on MLK's grave.  You can't fight stupid.
[comment]Soros &amp; Clinton ass puppet
[comment]Biden was recently praised for his ability to "stay on script". I guess remembering his lines feels challenging enough to heal racial wounds. What a fake!
[comment]He's so fucked come November
[comment]He’s flat[comment]Stop trying to contort my preconceptions! It’s uncomfortable.
[comment]I think he could help if he recognized his part in creating them. Unfortunately[comment]Ever since they wore hoods in the Klu Klux Klan
These race riots are wholly a Democrat Party and Democrat voter and Democrat police problem. The entire nation is finding out what it is like to live in the lawless hellholes that are Democrat down towns like Baltimore or Detroit or Chicago.

[comment]I damn near got attacked for debating a Bernie supporter and calling their plan communism. That's what it is[comment]Unbelievable. Cannot believe people fall for this bullcrap! Just because it has "democratic" in front of it...
[comment]I’m confused by this. I always understood communism to be where the government assigns jobs and pays people for their work. Is Bernie suggesting this? What makes socialism close to communism? Thanks!

Won’t happen. But it’d be cooler if it did.
[comment]She had nothing to gain..

Except the millions of dollars[comment]*ignores the almost million dollars she received in donations*
[comment]That was different. He was a republican.

[comment]Nobody should believe any woman who has any possible motivation to lie. Pretty much[comment]... except fame[comment]The lier got fame[comment]That’s why they have pivoted to “we believe her but we’re still voting Biden”

[title]Coronavirus is killing the Biden campaign — and making him look like a fool
[selftext]https://nypost.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-is-killing-the-biden-campaign-and-making-him-look-like-a-fool/[comment]We knew this was coming
[comment]Biden has become the only comic on TV as all of the late night comics have become political commentators.
[comment]Biden has a sexual assault accuser Joe Biden literally like pussy grabber like they labeled Trump. Make it headline news
[comment]Correction:

Coronavirus is killing the Biden campaign — and **exposing him** as a fool
[comment]Wonder if the DNC is allowing this because they are now thinking he is not a viable candidate.
[comment]The virus is making him look like a fool? Sure it's not just him being unable to speak and make sense because that's who he is already?
[comment]Didn’t take much.
[comment]Biden is ruining Biden’s campaign. He sounds like he can’t keep his train of thought.  But that witch Jill Biden keeps him going. She should loose her license.
[comment]Oh... oh THAT'S what's making him look like a fool!
[comment]I don’t think the virus is making him look like a fool...
[comment]Listen... We can't beat Joe up.... Yet.  Leave him alone until he is the actual nominee.  If we do this now the dims will replace him with someone else who might not be as easy to beat in November.  Leave him for now.  Keep your powder dry.  After the convention it'll be a free for all.  Wait for it.  Please.
[comment]Joe doesn’t need help from the coronavirus[comment]"Alex[comment]To be fair[comment]Yeah and it's making trump look like a great leader that really cares about the average American person /s
[comment]Yeah that plus the rape allegations.
[comment]It would be best if he doesn’t totally implode on himself anytime soon. I think it’s unrealistic (yet possible) that if Biden totally sh*ts the bed before the convention they’ll try to recruit Cuomo. He’s got his own problems and isn’t as awesome as the media would have you believe<|startoftext|>

[comment]The term 'fact checker' is an Orwellian construct. All the publicly promoted 'fact checkers' suspiciously share the same severely twisted partisan political bias. All the 'fact checkers' are out and proud flaming leftists
One thing all the fact checkers have in common is they are there to support the Democrat Party with lies[comment]I thought these platforms were to perform like modern-day public squares. It seems to me that if they're policing free speech[comment]I think if they are reporting *facts* with these checks[comment]I am Jack's shocked face.
