[comment]But he didn’t commit a violent crime...
[comment]Kaitlyn Bennet brought an AR-10 to her graduation and Tamir Rice was fatally shot for a toy gun.

Edit: I see this comment is not well favored and apologize to those offended. My point was to present to everyone what racial disparity can look like. He had dire consequences brought to him unlike her where as she was able to walk away with her life. Don’t quote me but Tamar was killed for being “armed” however the same did not apply to Kaitlyn. I hope everyone is doing okay x
[comment]Does this make cops less bad ?
[comment]Is there a source for this that I can show people?
[comment]Jesus, this topic has been researched and studied for decades with tons of data collected. To pretend it's just a myth is literally part of the problem

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/29/heres-why-we-dont-see-protests-when-police-unjustly-kill-white-people/
[comment]Source?
[comment]I understand we play the 'contrarian' attitude to whatever our opponents are feelings. But...we dont have to all the time. We can be willing to admit there are problems.
[comment]Interesting how the person that posted that is African American.
[comment]https://www.prisonpolicy.org/research/race_and_ethnicity/
[comment]what about all the people arrested and killed for nonviolent crime
[comment]Police brutality doesn't just encompass killings. There are endless videos of black people being brutally beaten by police while not resisting in any way. None of us should be supporting authoritarian violence against any race.
[comment]This kind of stuff is pushing me away from the party. This is plain ignorance that I cannot stand behind. Goodbye.
[comment]Despite the fact that African Americans commit 50% of the crime they only make up 30% of those killed by police, which means the police are less likely to use lethal force on African Americans.
[comment]Tweekers. Nobody is up in arms about tweeker deaths.
[comment]Jesus, what about sample size? Aren't black people only 13% of the population?
[comment]What’s truly sad about all this rioting is that it’s minority communities that are being destroyed and most likely will never rise up again
[comment]Such a stupid ass take. No one's denying law enforcement has a difficult job that may, on occasion, result in death and injury. The point is that law enforcement officials have been getting away with callous and almost hateful murder of it's citizenry and specifically the black population for far too long.
[comment]Another thought to add:

I'd figure that the arrest rates for African Americans are higher than it is for white people. They could have more deaths total but significantly more arrests which would be even worse.

Edit: I should proof read my spelling...
[comment]What the rioters are doing now, no police for has done or can do. They say they are for the people yet they are the ones affecting more minorities than any law enforcement
[comment]This means nothing without context. If you have 1000 black people arrested and 4 of them killed during the process against 2 whites arrested with 1 of them killed, you can brag that 50% of white people are killed during their interpellation against 0,4% from the  black community. It's bs but the numbers are correct. The demographic perspective is also  necessary: if 12 people die out of a community of 15 persons when 30 persons die out of a community of 300000, the second one is a tragedy that may reveals some problems inside its society, the first one is a genocide.
[comment]Yea but also per capita isn’t taken into account, is it?
[comment]So the problem is: A lot of people are cops that shouldn't be?
[comment]Ok. How many blacks/whites are killed during NON-VIOLENT arrests?
[comment]1. This small selected statistic (without citation of real data by the way), asking “how” is an argument based upon weak foundation. There are countless other statistics that would indicate that the system is racially biased towards African Americans.

2. George Floyd did not commit violence, so why are you referencing this statistic in the first place?
[comment]Do you guys not see that white people make up 70% of the crime and blacks make up like 29%. So by my math shouldn’t be that more whites should be killed by cops seeing how many crimes they commit.
[comment] Where are all the videos of cops actually using racial slurs? It's bad for anyone to die like that but damn it we need to focus on black on black crimes and fatherless families. And get off the plantation of welfare.
[comment] Well, a lot of blacks are killed without being accused of a crime. So....
[comment]George Floyd wasn't committing a crime, he tried to cash a $20 check and was then slowly choked to death for 8 minutes
[comment]Ok so I just had a progressive argue against this point with me. Someone please chime in if they can refute it.

Their argument was sure more white men are killed by the police. Even though black men commit more of the crime. However the only reason black men commit more crime is because the black communities are over policed. 

So there is more from being committed in white communities but the police aren’t there to catch it because all the resources are spent in black communities.

My only arguments were what empirical evidence do you have for that? As well as low socioeconomic status tends to lead to more crime which is rampant in the black communities.
[comment]They dont care about police brutality at these protests. I was there.
[comment]Truth is 99% perception and 1% facts. add on top most people just want quick and easy answers to complex problems, this will always give you delusional responses.Americans don't really know what they asking for in these protest, they just know there's a problem and they want it fixed with the easiest and quickest solution. and of course that's never going to work, and most likely make to problem worse or move the problem elsewhere. but they keep fighting for it none the less.
[comment]No, not true
[comment]But my emotions!
[comment]Can I see some stats on non-violent crime? Because most of the cases of black people killed by police were in cases where either they were being charged with a nonviolent crime, such as George Floyd, or cases where no crime was known to have been committed.
[comment]Isn't the issue about brutality and killings without even being arrested?
[comment]Fake asshole!!!
[comment]What about non-violent
[comment]I’d be curious about how many were “justified” and the amount of armed vs unarmed
[comment]how about the peaceful black people being killed! you're a fake puppet!
[comment]Is it not clear that what's missing here is the number of African Americans arrested for non violent crimes that are killed. That's the hidden number here.
[comment]Yes but we don’t now what the black people did and what the white people did. It’s not a matter of fact how many gets killed it’s why
[comment]“Are Coos Racist” and “The War On Cops” by Heather Mac Donald are both brilliant books on the subject.
[comment]How about:

1) how many other cops have as many complaints against them and are still cops? 

2) who reviewed all of these complaints against this cop and decided he could still be a cop?

3) were any of these complaints ever brought to the attention of the mayor or DA? If so, hold them accountable at the ballot.

4) these complaints should be reviewed by a committee that includes citizen representation.

If you really want to fix the system, start asking these kinds of questions of every mayor, chief of police and DA in every district and precinct across the nation. Keep asking until you get acceptable answers. This would be far more effective than protesting or rioting.
[comment]Are there stats for for non violent crimes and being killed by police? Also what about other races?
[comment]Y’all know data can be modified with it still be technically true right? There is a reason he didn’t post for all crime not just violent.
[comment]What about non violent crimes?
[comment]How is it possible?

It's a statistic not per 10,000 violent crimes, it's not even per 10,000 people arrested. The statistic is # people killed per 10,000 arrests.

If 1,000 people are arrested 10 times. That'd be 30 killed per person arrested.

If one group commits 2 crimes per arrest and the other commits 3 crimes per arrest, that's enough to offset the difference.

What is the actual truth? Difficult to say without the numbers. But, there is ample evidence that blacks are targeted for arrest at a far greater rate than whites.

Additionally, it's not only violent criminals that are shot. For those two years, 5.9% of whites killed were unarmed, while 8.4% of blacks killed were unarmed.
[comment]How many more 10s of thousands of black people are arrested over whites though?
[comment]Without the numbers for people killed while being arrested for non-violent crimes or receiving a citation, this is an incomplete dataset.

The protests are about the use of excessive force on non-violent alleged offenders.
[comment]When were we talking about VIOLENT crimes?
[comment]This is the stuff we need more of.  I'm getting lit up by friends and family for standing by my ideal that this is a police issue, not a race issue. I've been educated that I'm a racist.
[comment]If black people are arrested more frequently for violent crime than whites it would both account for this statistic and be evidence of pervasive policing bias. This one fact by itself isn’t really enough to prove anything though it does provoke interesting conversation. Also where is this stat from? Jc
[comment]More white males since 2017 have been killed by police than black males, just sayin.
[comment]Yes and black Americans make up 13% of the population. All killing is bad, but there is a bias against black Americans, which has been the case for a while now..

Anyone who wants a source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/
[comment]It’s not just about racism. It’s about the institutionalized police state. Black cops have abused the power to white civilians too. It’s not just racial but also an issue of police having zero accountability
[comment]Far too many people brigading this thread think this is some sort of attack on black people, as if they are being blamed or demonized.

I think the vast majority here recognize that black people disproportionately suffer from socioeconomic issues due to racism and other reasons. They are targeted for petty crime, frisked more often, and put away for charges other people may not be convicted of. Our horrendous prison system destroys their life, and puts them in contact with hardened criminals.

But that doesn't change the fact that police killings are directly proportionate to violent crime. For whatever reason, police killings are a color-blind issue, everyone should be equally pissed off. Trying to frame it by saying, "I'm tired of hearing of black people die." just comes off as ignorant. You are hearing of black people die for the same reason you hear about car chases - they draw in views.
[comment]Although the links provided are still confusing as there is too much info i don't know where to look lol i'm just going to assume the numbers are correct. The way i see it is every person of every race should be treated equally and have the same priviliges. These figures just prove to me that we all need the band together in solidarity to make the change happen and kick racism once and for all. I am a white man from the UK and i've realised it's not enough to just not be a racist but we need to do something about it. The governments over the decades/centuries have had all the power to make this happen but they have chosen to ignore us and divide our nations and will continue to do so,  so the blame lies almost entirely with them. It is now up to everyone of every race to challenge our governments and force equality measures.
[comment]Simple explanation, only look at the numbers for when the murdered was not peaceful and then also add the people killed not during an arrests (again while peaceful) and then you will see the bias.

&amp;#x200B;

This statistic here is misleading as it uses the simpson's paradox.
[comment]Where are the statistics for this clam
[comment]Whatsu the numbers on nonviolent crimes?
[comment]For those that want the data, here it is at the bottom of this paper. I highly recommend reading the entire paper. This man proves there is no racial injustice in America as the left is so willing to throw out. Also, keep in mind this is from  Roland G. Fryer, Jr.  a Black American at Harvard. 

[https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16\_fryer.pdf](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/workshop/leo/leo16_fryer.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the FBI website has the statistics.
[comment]Wonder why BLM doesn’t protest black on black crime. Oh wait they think black on black crime is cause by white people
[comment]There's a lot of back and forth on that thread, his sources actually aren't very good, one of them actually states that they were counted at under half the reality, as lots of precincts don't report the killings. Some people on there also cited other sources on there that said that black people get killed disproportionately more, but this is probably due to the disproportionate amount of crimes they commit. It seems like there are sources that show both sides being correct, so it's hard to really work out what's true and what to believe.
[comment]Tit for tat... that’s how I see it!
[comment]I think this country has a serious problem with systemic violence and institutionalized thuggery. We have come to expect and accept it, and that's part of the problem. Shut the riots down.
[comment]Is this actually the guy in the photo? Or just another white supremacist catfishing? You're a fraud!!!
[comment]“There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." -Mark Twain
[comment]Had to save this twice for good measure
[comment]You do realize that white people are 70% or so of the population and black people are 13% right? So when taking about absolute numbers, no matter the issue, there will be more white people
[comment]As usual with the liberal left and Democrats in general, it is NOT ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY, BUT WHAT THEY DO!  


Always, rules for thee and never for me...control for you and whatever we can steal while you are distracted!!!

[comment]What I don't understand is how is Police Brutality against Black people a partisan issue? Why must we try and find justifications in murder of people? What the fuck is wrong with this country?
[comment]If you look at the statistics, white America hates all minorities but then also loves Asians more than themselves.
[comment] 60.6%  of the population are white 
12.3% are black 

So maybe run those numbers again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]How is the left so dumb?
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/r3p4t6i2i2v41.jpg[comment]I dont think all of them are dumb it is just they blindly listen to the media and do whatever they say
[comment]Shouldn’t it say , “People who Listen to the President”. -
[comment]https://twitter.com/MichaelCoudrey/status/1254212267324784645?s=20
[comment]This is how one ends up on the left.
[comment]Some things the world may never know.
[comment]Why do you think it’s people on the left who are listening to Trump and following his advice? 

Poison control calls regarding exposure to household cleaners in NYC have gone way up since his comment.
[comment]Sometimes I wish they would and have natural selection sort them out. lol
[comment]i can't believe this is a real sub
[comment]I really don’t think it’s the dems that the drinking bleach joke is referring to. Its not like dems listen to Trump anyways, they’re not going to start because of this. I’m fairly certain this is the dems attempting to make fun of or mock republicans for “blindly following” him. This is just trying to flip the narrative and say “nuh uh”. Not coming to the dems support but I think you’re misinterpreting the joke the dems are making and claiming it’s the Republicans making the joke
[comment]I wouldn't even care if people drank or injected bleach or lysol at this point because you can't fix stupid and I'm tired of everyone having to try.
[comment]Left?
[comment]I was talking with my S/O about this today. The media has been so successful in convincing the left that Trump is so stupid that they genuinely believe stories like this now. 

If you hear the media report that a functioning adult said something so stupid that even someone with an IQ of 50 would know it's stupid, how can you possibly truly believe he really said it, a natural human response would be "There's no way he said that, you're lying or misleading or misquoting or something" but they have been so brainwashed into believing he is literally retarded that they believe more and more implausibly stupid things.
[comment]Yes "misinterpreted"
[comment]Wouldn't they be the ones NOT listening to trump?
[comment]Trump didn't even say that lol, nancy pelosi is just a piece of human Trash
[comment]Dude honestly I'm not voting for Biden. To be honest I cant vote for anyone. I'm from South Africa, I just love american politics. I didn't mean offense. I was just sharing the view of a foreigner who comes from a country with a difficult past full of lies and misinformation. So I take an interest in this all. 

Bidens a joke and a fool, but I dont think he has racial division, corruption and self enrichment at heart. As south park said it really is a douche and turd sandwich. 

To be honest it's hard to believe what's happen to America, the once pride and envy of the world, now looks like a wounded clown. All I hope is you guys recover from this.
[comment]You guys remember a few years ago when people, mainly teens &amp; young adults, were dumb enough to do that stupid Tide Pod challenge all because The Onion did this satirical story  [So Help Me God, I’m Going To Eat One Of Those Multicolored Detergent Pods](https://www.theonion.com/so-help-me-god-i-m-going-to-eat-one-of-those-multicolo-1819585017)? From there it went to Twitter, Tumblr, and eventually YouTube where a Aaron Swan started the challenge. All of that was because of social media and complete and utter irresponsibility. No, I do not say it's completely his fault for this. *However*, in this age of narcissism where everyone needs to share everything and will do just about anything for recognition, karma, points, etc., it was *somewhat* Swan's fault.

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, as the leader and Chief, President Trump is supposed to lead by example. He is not to make asinine statements and leave an impression that it is acceptable, smart, witty, cute, fun, etc., to do things like inject disinfectants. He is speaking to the same audience that Aaron Swan spoke to. Impressionable people. Whether you guys like it or not, he messed up. You cannot justify what he said. It was dangerous. Now you're probably thinking I'm a leftist, or Anti-Republican. In fact, I *am* a Republican. But I am also a responsible person and a realist. Is injecting disinfectants dumb? Of course it is! But don't dismiss the fact that people listen to our President and will, at his direction, be willing to try things that are dangerous. He's our leader. Again, lead by example.
[comment]Darwinian for sure. If you’re that stupid ..
[comment]Wow it’s honestly refreshing to see conservatives be self aware enough to be okay with making fun of themselves. Well done OP
[comment]Here’s the reality: he could say the sky is blue and they’d find some way to object.  In this case, they’ve once again taken something out of context and plastered it into headlines so that their base, who only reads headlines, will get riled up.
[comment]The Right be like, Electrolytes: It's what plants crave!
[comment]I’m pretty in the middle and what he said was still bad. Then to say he was being sarcastic. Maybe save the sarcasm for after a pandemic. 

Also why not just admit fault like ever.
[comment]well they elected a reality tv star so thats why
[comment]Listening to the full transcript of this and other Trump faux pas that got blown up, the real issue seems to be that Trump doesn't have the filter that causes most of us, when we're spitballing ideas, or just learning about something for the first time, to keep this news to ourselves.  


Do such impromptu statements by him get blown out of proportion?  Yes.  Does he need to learn to contain them better in order to better project calm leadership?  Also yes.
[comment]This post makes me want to leave this sub
[comment]These are the people who force politicians to speak a different language and be very rehearsed, evading, and indirect vs. just speaking plainly.
[comment]Keep Ina Garten out of this!
[comment]as a trumper i think he should control what he says
[comment]If they were average IQ or higher, they wouldn't be lefties.
[comment]Dat projection
[comment]They ate Tide Pods so what did you expect?
[comment]Why on earth do you think the left are the ones listening to him?
[comment]Dont get me wrong, he says some dumb shit. We aren't brain dead, so we know this. However...its is not nearly as bad as the Democrats make it seem. Especially compared to their Candidate. However, its so horrible that they hear one thing and run with it for weeks in end in attempt to smear him as much as possible. It is ridiculous.
[comment]The left has never been more of an ouroboros than they are with this stupidity. Not one person on the right is falling for this crap.
[comment]The only people who think he meant anything approaching reasonable are his lapdogs Even Trump disagrees with you. He's had to lie about it being sarcasm because even he realises what he said was dumb...why cant you?
[comment]Except it isn’t the left that is calling in asking if this works....
[comment]r/therightcantmeme
[comment]Cuz they went to college for liberal arts
[comment]Trump is perfect. Trump is divine. Trump is infallible.
[comment]The Trump deranged media obviously jumped all over this. For some, whose blood pressure doesn’t rise at the sight or sound of Trump, find it refreshing that he does sometimes think out loud. Say what you like, wrong or right, Trump is spontaneous and consequently honest most of the time
[comment]If this is this subs biggest hangup and the libs fav (at the moment) drum to beat then damn we still got it pretty good!  He’s a great Prez and he’s denounced and demonized by every last person in the media, liberals and all RINO’s. They charge him with BS hoaxes and straight up coup attempts on a regular basis. They’ve all been proven completely false and blaming him for corona is the latest. You’ll see during the debates how well he speaks as he obliterates Biden.. same for November when he wins in a glorious landslide.  This bubble of Reddit and twitter aren’t an accurate representation of the American people.
[comment]Still he's the only Prez that has the guts to stand up to China
[comment]He seemed kinda direct about his statement. He just says dumb things.
[comment]Donald Trump: “I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that.”

The right: “HoW iS tHe LeFt So Dumb?”
[comment]Wait I thought he was being sarcastic
[comment]They weren’t ever taught to think. Sheep since day one
[comment]This has to be a joke. 'misinterpreted'? You lot can't be that stupid
[comment]Impeachment didn't work, so now they are purposely being obtuse. They would absolutely kill themselves in a bid to "gotcha!" the President.
[comment]oh, right we should inject it, not drink it. oh actually sorry it was just sarcasm on national television in the middle of a pandemic.
[comment]this is an astonishingly stupid post

[comment]You mean you trump lapdog are the stupid one right?
[comment]I won't be surprised if people on the left intentionally drank it to stir shit up.
[comment]The amount of people I made mad with this post is fucking hilarious XD
[comment]Are they just deleting every democrat comment?
[comment]Left: Omg he said inject disinfectant into the body, he’s so dumb.

Right: No, he asked if it was possible to use disinfectant to kill corona in the body. He’s not a medical expert, he’s the president.

Trump: I said it sarcastically, to make fun of reporters like you.
[comment]You’d all be making memes of Obama doing this if he said exactly the same thing
[comment]If Trump didn't out right advise this...you all have to admit that he suggested it....

Take an honest look at what he said.....take a step out of the echo chamber
[comment]What did he mean by his statement then? I'm curious
[comment]Please don't ban me for this question, but I seriously don't know what he meant. Can someone please help me understand, normally I am with Donald but this one has me a little perplexed
[comment]How is that any American can possibly think the media is impartial? It's clear that they're out to attack him daily for any and every excuse they can make up. And we are supposed to trust them to fairly moderate the presidential debates? Trump should just bypass them and do something online directly for the voters.
[comment]These comments are why I left politics. Lol who the fuck would try and pretend that suggesting injecting disinfectant isn't some of the dumbest shit ever said.
[comment]So what did he mean?
[comment]Why is that liberals who have such an affinity for Socialism and Communism try to paint conservatives as fans of Putin?
[comment]you are very stupid and so is trump
[comment]Lol the left so stopid. MR. trump would never suggest this
[comment]I think the issue is not that people are stupid or may do stupid things. Many people from all social classes and all political wings are sometimes stupid or sometimes say stupid things. Many well educated people also do or say stupid things.
That is ok, we do not have to be smart all the time. We all deserve take break.
Except when you go on national television during a crisis and you are the President of the USA. Then you really need to put your game face on and be smart. There is no leeway for saying stupid things in such a situation.
Personally, I am not American, but I travel to the US regularly and have family and friends there. I sympathize with you all in this situation and wish you all the best to overcome this challenge despite the handicap.
[comment]“I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that...So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn’t been checked, but you’re going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body...,”

Did he tell people to inject or drink disinfectant? No.  But he suggested it be studied as a cure. It's like someone saying fire kills germs and suggesting we should get it "inside the body" to study it as a cure.
[comment]If you believe he was being sarcastic or making a joke, you’re a gimp of the highest order
[comment]Something that you inject that disinfects you from disease is called medicine. The fact it's even been suggested as something new to consider is worrying.
[comment]Let's run through the timeline of this shall we?

1. He says we should look into injecting disinfectants.
2. The media reports on what he said making him look incredibly stupid
3. Fox news and other right wing news outlets claim he's being taken out of context.
4. Trump, as expected, cannot bear to look stupid so he tells reporters he was being sarcastic.

So tell me was he taking a national crisis lightly by being sarcastic? Was he taken out of context? Or is it more likely he's a bumbling fool? One would think all of you would say he was being sarcastic as that is what he, himself said, but no in your defense of this nonsense you people are all over the road. Get a grip on reality and face that you elected one of the dumbest people alive.
[comment]Trump literally said, “I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute,” referring to disinfectants such as isopropyl alcohol that had previously been brought up at the briefing. “And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets inside the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.” When he was later pressed by The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker on why he was trafficking in such speculative ideas, Trump didn’t back off or give any indication it was some kind of ruse. Instead he got angry with Rucker.


But setting all that aside, Trump just threw all those people who made the argument McEnany was making under the bus.


One of them was Breitbart News, which Thursday night quickly ran what it portrayed as a fact check of Trump’s comments. Witness this amazing argument: “Trump used the word ‘inject,’ but what he meant was using a process — which he left ‘medical doctors’ to define — in which patients’ lungs might be cleared of the virus, given new knowledge about its response to light and other factors.”

[comment]Beautiful is not sitting around with a bunch of corrupt war mongers, Nixon/bush? Total scum bags.
[comment]Get rid of Bush
[comment]I count 4 of them with carriers bearing their name.
[comment]Eisenhower looks like a body builder here.
[comment]God bless all of the good presidents
[comment]In what world is trump in that good of shape?
[comment]I feel that even with all the powerful men around, Trump would still be the alpha and own the room
[comment]Hey nice democrat repellent I’ll take 15
[comment]you could remove the Jr Bush and put in MLK
[comment]Done by Andy Thomas, resident of my hometown. Notice the unknown woman approaching the table.
[comment]Who’s the pretty lady over the Gipper’s left shoulder?
[comment]Except for Bush its perfect
[comment]Perhaps I dont know my president well enough, but by god it looks like Fraiser Crane behind DJT.
[comment]So glad they didn’t forget my favorite. Calvin Coolidge!!
[comment]Is that Tony Stark? Oh wait, that’s President Lincoln.
[comment]They forgot approximately 150lbs on Trump’s torso.
[comment]Why Nixon? He's known as one of the worst. Watergate?
[comment]I am so very confused by the comments
[comment]I will find a way to frame this image to hang in the entrance hall of my house.
[comment]Funny how all the republican presidents were strong men compared to democratic. Excluding Truman. 
My opinion!
[comment]Fuck Teddy Roosevelt!!! P.O.S.!!!

I like that Peyton Manning is in a tie on the upper right side, though. Still sporting that 8-head.
[comment]Why the hell would Teddy Roosevelt be there by Trump?  One was a conservationist, the other one wants to destroy everything that Teddy stood for.
[comment]TRUMP 2020!
[comment]This post is pretty gay.
[comment]W., Nixon, and Trump at the table instead of Grant? These choices are pretty questionable.
[comment]Nixon is the only part of this painting I dislike. The rest is a masterpiece.
[comment]which one is Judas?
[comment]Half of those guys would have honestly shot the other half by now. Extremely talented drawing but the subject matter is iffy.
[comment]Dude it’s ain’t beautiful, Nixon shouldn’t be there
[comment]I like how far they put Taft back there 😂
[comment]The fact that half the comments are calling this painting terrible shows that half this subreddit doesn't belong here
[comment]Painted by Andy Thomas. Good piece. The woman approaching in the background is supposed to be the first woman president. There are also a couple more nods in the piece.
[comment]Trumps head is too big.
[comment]I like it with Nixon in there. He makes the Donald fit in a little better.
[comment]The bush family would never sit at the table with Trump sadly.
[comment]My friend has this hanging in his house
[comment]No-Bama
[comment]You guys can call people libtards and cuks and communists all you want. But at least we don't have painting of other dudes up in our houses like a bunch of queers. You guys are fuckin gayyyyyy.
[comment]Wonder what the conversation would be about?
[comment]Where are the flames of hell.....
[comment]Add Jackson? Took on big banks and won
[comment]“And then I told them they were ‘Fake News’”
[comment]This shit's weird
[comment]Nice work, they look like they went all to the same highschool together and now like after 50 years everyone is catching up with each other
[comment]Hilarious that Trump has a diet coke and same with Bush.
[comment]Roosevelt wouldn’t even go into the bar if he knew Trump was there. Or just toss him out by his pretty blonde hair.
[comment]Teddy Roosevelt was insanely progressive though..
[comment]Fantastic. No Obama to be found
[comment]Its funny because nixon and reagan are criminals and teddy and lincon dont stand for the things you people think they stand for.
[comment]Retard reality show host is lost in the conversation
[comment]This is ok but trump just looks straight up photoshoped
[comment]Remember when Presidents didn’t need photoshop to look serious? I will never forget Obama.
[comment]I'm a moderate dude and I love some of these guys but Trump seems wildly out of place here man.
[comment]Wait, how is Teddy Roosevelt considered a Republican? Didn't he run under his own party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]And this is why we need guns people! When the govt becomes a police state and comes to your doorstep shooting for you being outside your OWN house
[selftext]https://streamable.com/u2jzoo[comment]They’re using paintball guns, just an fyi. It’s shitty and they shouldn’t be doing that, but it most certainly doesn’t justify shooting them
[comment] Follow police orders you fucking idiots. What do you think is going to happen when you disobey orders from a group of terrified, riled up police members.
[comment]what are you going to do with your guns? shoot police officers? go to jail for life for killing a cop?
[comment]All over bully and shutting down barbers and restaraunts. But the riots start and no one is around.
[comment]It's a curfew, what do u expect, an invitation?
[comment]Was this done because they weren't obeying curfew? A curfew imposed because were being criminals. The officer said "Stay in your home".
[comment]It’s how they are doing this. They look untrained. Lack of training and lowered standards is what cost the first life.
[comment]I bet people will be 100 times  happier to see these cops than a group of rioters burning down homes and property.
[comment]You’ll discover very quickly the difference between the police and military.
[comment]But if you got rid of all the guns then no one could shoot at you on your own porch.just saying this article seems a little flawed in how it sounds
[comment]Could someone tell me why this was quickly posted here but it took a while for it to appear on r/Conservative and it seems to be quite controversial there? Do these subs not have the same demographic?
[comment]I guess the government has decided the white neighborhoods need to get on board with the coming summer of rage.
[comment]The 2nd amendments purpose is literally for this situation
[comment]I would shoot them with my scout, would tale at least 2 withe then if they entered my house no problem I have my 12 gauge
[comment]So what do you do when you run out of ammo after shooting back at the popo? This is when logic just crushes your entire argument
[comment]Given what happened here I wanted to clear up what is happening in Minneapolis. What happened last night was that the rioters were going into porches and pretending to live in some of the houses. This doesn’t excuse the behavior but I’m just explaining WHY they ordered her to get inside. 

The media also will not talk about the fact that police officers in Minneapolis were getting shot at and Molotov cocktails were being thrown.
[comment]I'm pro-gun and believe in keeping the government in check, however, you defending your home with a gun when this parade comes to town will get your family killt.
[comment]How would you shooting back have helped this situation?
[comment]I’m okay with the National Guard showing up to try and stop the riots that are hurting and killing people, but this is a step too far, imo.
[comment]Where was this?
[comment]The entire MN police force seems to need retraining...
[comment]When ya act like assholes and loot &amp; burn shit down- that’s the result. Don’t be mad at the national guard or police- be mad at the assholes taking advantage of a situation.
[comment]That’s why we should be fighting to lower taxes on the middle class. All we are doing is giving more power to the government and less power to the people.
[comment]The title is very misleading, it’s implying they are shooting live rounds but it’s just paintballs. Considering people are burning the city to the ground in “protest” it seems like the best thing for everyone
[comment]Or try not burning down the city provoking factions specifically meant to establish order.
[comment]Kill the Nazi police officers on sight. Any officer "following orders" is a threat to civilian lives. They have no capability to think for themselves and no empathy to consider their victims' lives. Everyone needs to get their guns out now or arm up if you don't have any. Set traps around your house if you can.
[comment]We should all know the context of massive riots in Minneapolis.  Along with that, the burning and looting.  They have shelter in place orders and probably curfews.  This stupid woman could have walked in her front door.  That’s all they asked for her to do.  Since she wasn’t cooperating, the got bean bagged.  Sucks to be stupid.
[comment]No, this is when we draw the line, and we start training officers to actually protect and serve
[comment]I wonder *why* they are patrolling in the first place, it couldnt have anything to do with the large scale riots and "peaceful" protests, could it?  I don't think the media brings enough attention to why these thing happen.  It/they only give attention/shame to the governmental effects, and not the "civil" causes.
[comment]We need to organize a counter-protest for the police, build a giant trapdoor underneath it, then drown them all in pepper spray. And also, piss on their graves when they die.
[comment]Cops like these are nothing but Government boot lickers - no different than Nazi Germany!! 
“Just following orders” - Tyrannical cowards.
[comment]Bruh, shooting the cops in retaliation or even brandishing my gun in response is gonna end badly m’kay?
[comment]Yeah cause opening fire on a group of ~20 cops sounds like a great idea!
[comment]They want to be Democrats, they want to be Socialists, they want to be on the left, this shouldn't surprise them.
[comment]This will resort more protests because only in masses can the people stand up.
One individual guy shooting back will just resort in a gunfight. But protests involving thousands is a whole different ballgame.
[comment]Random pallets of bricks are just randomly showing up in downtown Dallas... this isn’t a protest, it’s a well funded insurrection. Governors are activating the National Guard for good reason.
[comment]Were riots nearby this neighborhood?
[comment]I say listen to the police orders to go inside
[comment]Reminds me of Modern Warfare 2. "Fall back to the Burger Town !"
[comment]I’m with you here OP. People seem to forget which side they are on. Anti-authoritarianism is what this is about; not just when it’s in their favor!
[comment]I can assure you opening fire on officers wouldn't help
[comment]It’s almost like the second amendment becomes functionally useless in the presence of actual authoritarianism.
[comment]While I’m not defending the shooting here, they did tell them like 20 times to go inside before firing (plus it seemed like they were using rubber bullets, no intent to kill). I can understand that they want people to go inside to stay safe when people are rioting in the streets, I don’t think that’s unreasonable considering we’ve forced people to stay in their homes over a lot less
[comment]I know this will get a lot of hate but:
A, You see the situation in Minneapolis right now. The police need the situation completely under control. B, They yelled at them several times to get in the house. And C, they were using paintball guns.

I’m completely pro guns but the purpose of the 2nd amendment is not to protect against cops armed with paintball guns trying to control a riot.
[comment]Looks like ANTIFA sitting around planning. The National Guard said go back into your house. ANTIFA had a choice and they chose to disobey the authorities. These looters paid the price. Oh well.
[comment]Get inside sounds fine.
[comment]I actually am a big lefty and came here just to read what everyone on the right was saying right now and I just wanted to contribute that I agree, this is why we need guns, this is what the second amendment is for. There’s clearly an abuse of power by the state happening. Ok bye!! Xoxo
[comment]Folks as bad as it looks, please read the direct quote from the Curfew page and realize they are within their right as officers to do what they did.

Can I be outside my house (on my property) after 8 p.m. and before 6 a.m.?

Yes. You can be on your porch, yard, patio, etc., but if a law enforcement officer or other public safety official asks you to go inside, or take any other action, you must follow the instruction.<|endoftext|>

[comment]He was all over the place in that interview
[comment]wow murdered
[comment]Look... Mika... we're on the same team. I've been treated with great care, and this is outside of the agreed-upon arrangement.
[comment]God that was so painful to watch.

That 3 seconds of dead air felt like an eternity.
[comment]I’m legitimately surprised that she went at him as hard as she did. And not only that, he seemed unprepared for it. 

There’s almost a 100% chance that they met and discussed this beforehand, that Biden’s team approved of all of the questions beforehand, and he still sounded like a student winging a book report in front of the class.
[comment]If his own team at Ms.DNC idls riding him this hard, he is toast.
[comment]At least he stayed awake for this one. Props, Quid pro quo Joe!
[comment]I couldn't tell, was he blinking "help me" in Morse code on this one?
[comment]IM GUNNA TAKE YER AR-14's bois! NOT!
[comment]He doesn't want to release the info because it could make him look bad. Why does he even have the power to hid things that could make him look bad. How about don't do things that could make you look bad.
[comment]How come r/politics doesn’t show this stuff
[comment]r/cringe
[comment]So basically all the work he’s done while performing duties as a public servant are unfair to judge while he’s running for the biggest public servant job in the world? 

Got it....lol
[comment]I feel better now knowing Joe didn’t do it.
[comment]Does anyone else cringe every time he speaks? I almost feel bad for the guy. He literally can’t go two sentences without uttering nonsense words.
[comment]You know, maybe she reached into her past, her father was a decent man, or maybe she just got tired of being a shill for the Democrats. O feel like I went back in time with this interview.

Don’t be surprised if Billary gets called in from the Bullpen.
[comment]One part of this story bothers me.  If I filed a report 1) I would ask for a copy and 2) I would know the name of who I reported it to.

Obviously, innocent until proven guilty in the USA if Democrat, but guilty until proven innocent if a Republican.

The hypocrisy is amazing, but again this part seems odd to me.

[comment]There will be a crisis over this. The party will twist and turn and finally put forth a candidate who has no chance.
[comment]What's wild is that people are saying Mika "pushed" Biden in this interview. She didn't ask him about the "hugs, kisses, and touching that women said made them uncomfortable." stuff that the NY Times tweeted and then later removed, she doesn't ask about the Larry King Live video, etc.

Biden says the University of Delaware stuff can't be released because it has records pertaining to his job like his positions on topics and interviews. She should have asked why the public cannot see, as Biden says, "...all of those things relating to my job."

This was a pretty softball interview overall
[comment]It’s hard to comprehend how hypocritical Biden is about his secrecy talking to foreign leaders when Biden and the left demand to know what was said and investigate Trump every time time he utters a word to any foreign leader.
[comment]so... don't release the records because they show my record and that can become "fodder"...

is he not proud of his record?
[comment]*shredder gently hums in Newark*

[comment]Hmmm...you fellas should look deep into your souls and maybe count how many hookers your dear leader had sex with, how many times did he cheat on his pregnant wife etc...but I guess you don’t care about all that because your heads are so far up his ass that you could almost see Hannity 🤣🤣🤣
[comment]Bet you won't see this on r/politics today......
[comment]*deer in headlights* Wait, what's the point of a search? Nothing would be found, anyway.

Shouldn't we just do a push-up contest or go out back to settle this the right way?
[comment]*that awkward moment when Mika shifts in her seat knowing he raped that girl*
[comment]Even if those records don't have anything to do with Reed there is obviously something in those records he doesn't want to be seen.
[comment]In the first question, he's literally arguing that people shouldn't know what positions he took or how he executed his job duties. 

"You shouldn't do a search because there's nothing there. Just take my word for it." - Joe Biden
[comment]The way he adjusts his posture at 0:09 is unsettling. 
Innocent until proven guilty, but he’s not helping himself here.
[comment]There a youtube version of this video?  You go to MSNBC and they cut right after he says "No, It didn't happen." Case closed, he denied it.  This is part of the 18min video, which face it... nobody is going to watch if you share that.

[comment]How long do you think Mika's going to be working at MSNBC after this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. the DNC stands with Joe and destroys her, or 
2. Joe goes down in flames and we find out the mystery candidate that takes his place (Bernie or one of the has-been's)
[comment]My only quess as to why she went after him was she has been alone and sniffed by Joe, and was getting back at him.
[comment]It would be funny to watch if it wasn’t so sad
[comment]R/Politics says this isn’t a trial and it’s a job interview when Kavanaugh got accused so no due process is needed. Biden is interviewed for a job so he doesn’t need due process.
[comment]Lol and from MSNBC too dang
[comment]When he got his son a cushy job??
[comment]He doesn't have to be competent to be their man, necessarily. Here's a scenario: 

Biden is elected, names Hilary as Vice President. Biden has an "accident" at some point thereafter, and Hilary is de-facto President. 

He just has to last long enough to name her as VP. 

Scary thought, tbh.

<|startoftext|>[title]The truth
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/ptea613ima251.jpg[comment]They aren't entirely wrong, but your point is certainly spot on.

There are clearly actors that are not part of the group instigating violence. It seems antifa is indeed acting within these protests. However, BLM is not quite the calm and peaceful protest group they claim to be and they are certainly not all about racial equality. When your group blocks traffic and chants that the only good cop is a dead cop, then yeah, your group might kind of suck. Or if you say "no justice, no peace" meanwhile the person you are angry with is facing justice and being held on $500,000 bail while awaiting a trial for murder, then maybe you are protesting for a silly reason. Maybe nationwide protests aren't necessary. This wasn't Rodney King with cops blatantly beating a guy up. This was a dumb ass cop who was not following protocol.
[comment]Every republican ive talked to was an idiot. All republicans are idiots 🖕
[comment]BLM is a foreign funded insurgency. The BLM goons are out there to sow the seeds of discontent and gin up race hatred. If they were protesting hoping to make the world peaceful, they would not be advocating for vandals and looters and rioters.

A serial killer spends most of his time not stacking bodies, but no one cares about his downtime. People only care that there are bodies left over when the killer goes to work. BLM doesn't loot or rob or riot or burn business all the time. Sometimes they are too busy dragging people out of their cars and lynching them in the street.
[comment]Except that protesters are regular citizens who may not have the authority, training, or physical ability to stop violent actors around them. 

Police officers do have the authority, training, physical ability, and even gear to stop violence, so when they fail to stop other officers who are acting with violence or corruption it is fair to paint them with the same brush.
[comment]This is kind of a strawman that you're making here. Clearly not all protesters think ALL cops are bad, and we've seen clear evidence of that.
[comment]The protestors do not believe all cops are bad, rather they want to good cops to weed out the bad. They know most cops aren't bad.
[comment]I appreciate everyone here having a respectful and knowledgable debate, instead of just throwing around profanities and name calling. We don't all have to agree on everything but we can still respect each other🙌
[comment]These protestors are Patriots fighting against government tyranny.
[comment][this was my feed just now. ](https://ibb.co/ZY4CHfy)
[comment]Also - all gun owners are violent criminals, but also only cops should have guns.



The level of mental gymnastics do these people should qualify for gold every time at the olympics.
[comment]Exactly. There so few people that don’t have double standards for everything.
[comment]No one polices the police. They get away with 10x more than any normal person. It's a pretty brutal difference. They should be held to a MUCH HIGHER standard than civilians, or they don't need that MUCH HIGHER authority.
[comment]Its a turd in the punchbowl situation for both sides.
[comment]Honestly I see the logic considering the protestors have been [seen](https://www.reddit.com/r/instantkarma/comments/gug5kf/peaceful_protest_not_raging_riots/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  actively turning the rioters to the police. The day the cops turn the tucked up ones in is when it’ll be equal
[comment]Do you fail to see the hypocrisy in this comment? The right has been telling us for years that "not all cops are bad and it's a few bad apples." Meanwhile, anytime there's misconduct, all the body cams are magically dead, the "investigation" always determines there's no wrongdoing, and the thin blue line lies to protect the officers involved.
[comment]This sub: Authoritarianism is bad

This sub: Protect and respect our boys in blue
[comment]This is not a political issue, this is a human rights issue.
[comment]Playing devil's advocate: the cops are the ones who have the power, while protestors don't, so they can't be compared like this. But yea, whoever says all cops are bad are just trying to stir up trouble rather than protesting.
[comment]I don’t see that is their claim at all, I don’t think BLM thinks all cops are bad but cops enforce a an unjust system of law, so yes cops are bad they chose to enforce the laws of a corrupted system. The police state IS the problem.
[comment]Yeah but the protesters aren’t killing people every single day
[comment]The difference is it isn't the job of the peaceful protestors to stop rioters. It IS the job of good cops to stop bad cops.

The saying isn't "one bad apple makes the whole barrel LOOK bad" it is "one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel."

I don't think most cops are bad people, but I DO think most cops are bad cops. At least in the big cities. There are degrees of bad. The cops that use excessive force, frame people and are on the take are certainly the worst of them. And I think in most jurisdictions they are in the minority. However, the cops that cover for the worst cops, or look the other way when they see wrong doing are also bad cops, and that kind of bad cop seems to be in the majority of large city police forces. 

And that isn't me playing holier than thou. If I were a cop I probably wouldn't have the courage to turn in the bad cops either, which would make me a bad cop and thus not suited for the job.
[comment]Police cannot have any “bad apples” that job like the military needs to have serious repercussions to anyone not doing their job properly.
[comment]Called the “not all Scotsman” rhetorical case if anybody is wondering
[comment]I personally don’t mind riots so long as they’re not geared towards innocent business owners, and more geared towards police stations, and I wouldn’t normally even be OK with riots, it’s just the whole battle between police brutality over 200 years
[comment]But yes, that is their logic, and it’s rarted
[comment]I mean the protest is that the system keeps letting this happen but sure, you believe that
[comment]As one user pointed out, this is a strawman. Moreover, I think people are protesting the tendencies of police departments to protect their police officers so as to not damage the public relations within their community. Just look at the statement

https://web.archive.org/web/20200526121443/https://www.insidempd.com/2020/05/26/man-dies-after-medical-incident-during-police-interaction/

"he appeared to be suffering medical distress"

Yes, for them it is a race issue, but nonetheless it is still a police brutality issue.
[comment]The issue they are protesting is that the small group of bad cops are protected from persecution when they misbehave
[comment]If you‘re still supporting the cops you‘re farther deranged than Ben Garrison. Just saying.
[comment]The protestors themselves acknowledge this though, and do not associate or try to protect these rioters. 

There isnt such an acknowledgement within the police force. Would a good man harboring a fugitive not also be legally responsible and charged?

Edit: a word
[comment]Republicans: you can't say all gun owners are violent when it's only a VERY SMALL group being violent! The majority of us use guns for peaceful things! 

Also Republicans: there are a few bad protesters out there so ALL protesters are bad!!

See the fallacy in "the truth" of your post?
[comment]I always thought school was dumb for trying to teach "critical thinking". Like, how hard is it to just think things through? When I see posts like these, I realize I was wrong to criticize.
[comment]Remember, these are the same people who say everything is relative like morality and identity. We’ve seen Democrats blatantly lie in order to advance their political agenda or ignore context and facts. The logic of the left is just sad
[comment]The problem is the cops get paid no matter who or how they kill.
[comment]This really isn't a political issue. You can support good cops and still support these protests. The issue stems from the fact that bad cops are not being punished severely enough. That Asian police officer should have told his fellow officer to get off his neck and helped him get up so they could just arrest him rather than stand there to defend his fellow officer. I don't know what went through in his mind but any sensible officer would have noticed that Floyd was in any way a danger to anyone. My brother-in-law is a cop. He damn sure ain't letting a co-worker of his do that in front of him. I respect the work a police officer does but it's not difficult to spot bad cops when you're around then unless you're also a bad cop.
[comment]Isn't the difference that the protesters are calling out the bad protesters for doing bad things while police officers don't call each other out for doing bad things like murder unarmed people?
[comment]Well you can argue that some bad protesters make the whole protest wrong while agreeing that some bad cops make an unjust system.

Or

There are some bad protesters, but there are some bad police. Not everybody is defined by the mistakes of the few.

You’d be a hypocrite to believe that one group is all bad because of some bad examples while believing the opposing force simply has a few bad apples.

In a nutshell, the kind of person you are is to either blame the whole, blame the guilty, or you’re an asshole just trying to rage

Thanks for coming to my ted talk:)
[comment]It’s already been said but there’s bad people on both sides. But there’s a systemic problem here that happens all the time, and it’s not rioting.
[comment]Citizen protestors vs cops who are supposed to work for them... exercising rights vs a job... proof that there are specific agitators in the protests vs endless footage of savage rioting cops... I wonder who’s in the right. Acab
[comment]i dont think protesting a child rapist is so bad
[comment]Tell me why I have to call my family and make sure they are safe because there’s all these protestors and looters going crazy and everyone is going down the street just shows they scare me more than cops how dumb
[comment]We can apply this logic to anyone in their tribe and demonstrate why it's unfair to label the entirety of the group due to a nonrepresentative minority commits the transgressions.

Black people? But not all...

Latino? But not all...
[comment]Which one is it
[comment]Two signs I saw from protesters that were extremely troubling. One said abolish the police. I’m like you need some organization to enforce the law or you have anarchy. The second was all policemen are klansmen. I mean cmon a lot of police officers are black or other minorities. This is an egregious overstatement. There are racist cops but a small minority. No one will take you seriously if you say stupid shit like that
[comment]They are protesting a systemic problem, not demonizing all police. If you're still denying the validity of the BLM movement you are part of the problem.
[comment]Almost like protesters didn't take an oath to protect and serve and then go around killing people who can't fight back with impunity or something.
[comment]I don’t think anyone thinks all cops are bad. Even if it’s a small percentage (1% let’s say), that’s still a hell of a lot of bad cops.

The bigger problem is not the bad cops themselves, but the system that allows these cops to continue working, not face retribution, and the “good” cops protect them. The good cops need to weed the bad ones out of the force.
[comment]Maybe they should have sent the national guard to deal with the “small” percentage of bad cops before rioting began.
[comment]Protesters are exercising a constitutional right. Rioters are not. Good cops follow the rule of law and protect individuals constitutional and legal rights. Bad cops break the law in their enforcement, and violate individuals constitutional rights, or simply look the other way.
[comment]Most cops are good, most protesters are good. Bad cops are terrible. Rioters are also terrible. We can condemn both.
[comment]this is not true
[comment]Of course, protesters aren't armed by the state and given qualified immunity for their actions, as well as being protected by a corrupt union.
[comment]Literally makes no sense.

Protesters do not necessarily form coherent group. There is no "protest leader" that can stop bad people from joining in the protest, there is no such leader that can reprimand or at least denounce the "bad" who associate with them. (I will add, if there is a head of such a movement, then yes, anybody who still willingly associate with such a movement is bad.)

Police do form groups, and there are indeed leaders that decided to hire or not bad people from joining. Those leaders can too reprimand and denounce the "bad" who associate with them. In fact, they can fire them. Therefore, a few bad cops not being fired necessarily does mean the group is bad.
[comment]This is a strawman  because the movement isn't saying all cops are bad, it's saying the system of policing is bad. If cops give into general stereotypes based on experience or preconceived notions or bias, they may make a mistake. The system is designed to sweep that mistake under the rug, this results in general mistrust which creates a divide between a community and the policing system, which starts the cycle.
The protest is about ending the cycle and the only way that can happen is if more accountability is legislated. That is the movement in a nutshell.

I personally feel cops should get a huge pay increase akin to doctors, especially with all they do and put up with. The caveat, if you make a mistake in arresting or shooting someone who by the court of law is found not guilt of the crime accused, then the cop should be fired after judicial review. There can be a demerit system before termination that involves paying hefty fines as well as suspension without pay to offset minor or first time offenses, but it basically treats an officer with the same benefit/cost of being a doctor
[comment]Man, hundreds of people burning one city (multiply this by the amount of cities being trashed) is clearly only a few protesters and they clearly aren’t joining in on things
[comment]I swear this would have been great 2 weeks ago when society allowed you to live in your own bubble and think every POC was lying about police issues but now if that’s how you feel then so be it
[comment]Well who’s Fault is that ?
[comment]We have to get them to achieve more in school.
[comment]Thats not an apples to apples comparison. The problem's with the system/culture that's ingrained into the police. That doesn't make the individuals themselves bad or corrupt. The protestors are not an organized force, so it's easy for somebody who wants to take advantage of the situation and infiltrate peaceful protests to cause mayhem and loot. Nobody's infiltrating the police so the comparison is just wrong period.
[comment]Hypocrites: A few bad apples doesn't mean that all police are bad
Also hypocrites: There are few people taking advantage of the protests to loot and riot. ALL PROTESTERS ARE LOOTERS AND RIOTERS.<|endoftext|>

Why the fuck are we surmounting a common sickness that barely kills anyone with a great depression and draconian style government overreach?

Need another civil war. Motherfuckers need to be reminded whom they serve.
[comment]If people want to protest some shit that only *they* have control over, by all means, protest away.  But don’t get butt-hurt when more and more people die and you get partially blamed for it.
[comment]The government can shut down businesses, because businesses require a license to operate. However, our government cannot disperse protestors. It is a clear violation of first amendment rights.
[comment]Communism
[comment]Look, you can protest any time you want. You can hold protests and petitions online. But the more you idiots go outside and interact with eachother the more this virus will spread and the worse this problem will get. In Michigan we had a drive in protest, where the protestors drove to the capital to protest our shitty governors actions. But they didnt leave their cars for anything. If you use your heads we wont have problems
[comment]It's embarrassing as a Republican to see people in our party breaking the law and try to avoid responsibility because "They were protesting." 

That's the kind of shit Antifa or BLM does.
[comment]I'm going to go ahead and agree with the governor. This isn't a normal time. We're in the middle of pandemic that's only getting worse. Over 30,000 people have already died from the virus, and over 600,000 are sick. This protest is completely pointless and dangerous. When the pandemic is over then go protest.
[comment]For fuck sakes go home we are embarrassing ourselves I'm sorry but when there is a global pandemic that spreads like wildfire then maybe protesting isn't that important right now.
[comment]The Raleigh PDs social media guy apparantly doesnt know the Constitution. The only thing they might be violating is social distancing orders. Protesting, assembling and being outside are not illegal.
[comment]Heh. Let’s see the 4-5 officers handle 500-1,000 peaceful but non compliant protestors. Should be entertaining.
[comment]Silly Raleigh...WE, the People...make that call.
[comment]Yeah we only allow riots from BLM and Antifa but you people wanting freedom is just non essential
[comment]Keep on protesting, the more you protest the more of you die from covid.

I see that as an absolute win
[comment]You can protest without gathering and spreading a disease
[comment]Literally they should stay inside. They have every right to protest when this is over.
[comment]During a virus epidemic protesting is a non essential activity according to the police department, one of the rising problems during this time is how can you limit the citizen without taking his rights . I think it's not the right thing to do, giving away natural right for a little bit of protection is a false way of thinking.
[comment]Mind repeating that in German?
[comment]They might want to read that Constitution thingy and rhe Bill of Rights. We are not under martial law. Our rights do not go away because some politician issues a decree.
[comment]Then "Democracy" itself is thus a "**non-essential activity" too?**
[comment]Guys. Even if it is a violation of the constitution, people shouldn’t be out there in the first place. A small few people defying common sense and protesting in the middle of a pandemic is just plain dumb. This is just the kind of bait that democrats use to slander us. Don’t be stupid. Protest from home, flood the state office buildings with letters, but don’t make all of us look dumb. This is dangerous and harmful and in the end will only hurt us, both politically and physically.
[comment]Scary times
[comment]these protesters are fucking morons like what the fuck are you thinking are you trying to spread the disease assholes

[comment]If their right wing : yea protest ! Freedom!

If their left wing : bunch of crybabies get a job I can't believe theyre blocking traffic oh my goodness protesting is so childish support the police!! 

The hypocritical right ladies and gentlemen.
[comment]So let me get this right, the government creates an unconstitutional bill and see no retalition from the people. Once they knew about it, they protested against the tyrannical government and their move was "protesting is non essential" How about the gov sit their ass down and do whats nessassary. The stimulas package should've only covered the hospital and the lost pay due to the governors shutting business down. There is no need to send millions, let alone billions of dollars to corporations and funding democrat's  idiotic agenda from the past 10 to 20 years. Explain to me why Nancy Polosi need millions to fund gun control from the stimulus package? Will anyone bother explaining me this.
[comment]What if the prohibition (on protesting) was temporary for let's say six more weeks. What about three months? Six months? A year?

Temporary is pretty subjective.

What's the joke? "Free beer tomorrow!"

What if, in this case and potentially others, our tomorrow never comes?

[comment]I mean I don’t support abortion but if we sent kids like me to school I would give my family the virus and my dad would probably die cause he has immune system issues we can’t send kids to school because the United States would be in more of a state of shit than it already is
[comment]*Killing unwanted fetuses, not children.
[comment]This is one thing I can never get behind with Republican subreddits. I’m very conservative fiscally but fighting over something like abortion really hurts our image to the general public.

It doesn’t make sense that so many conservatives are so gung ho on keeping firearms unregulated but also all for regulating abortion. It would make sense that we would be against regulations on both, no? If we want to preach how regulations don’t work and just make things worse with firearms that logic should really carry over to abortion. Much like how if guns are illegal people will still obtain them, people will still get abortions through more unsafe means if abortion is made illegal. The only thing defunding planned parenthood does is hurt women. They do a lot more than provide abortions. Increasing access to birth control methods is by no means a bad thing, and if anything their services in that area REDUCE the amount of abortions provided.
[comment]Well the ones being killed are still in the womb. The others are living children who can spread a virus that kills people. Also, planned parenthood does do lots of other medical things other then abortions. I remember as a younger man going there to get an STD test. I personally wouldn't want my children in a classroom. Heck when it's cold and flu season they all get sick. Keeping them safe and schools closed is the smart thing.
[comment]To be fair the public education system is slag.
[comment]At least they’re not being brainwashed at public screwools!
[comment]This is a dumb meme. Sure, abortion is bad. It’s pretty much the main issue that informs my voting. At the same time, I’m a teacher and I’m worker harder now than ever before to try and get a bunch of high schoolers to have a solid foundation in chemistry. I’m working harder than ever to help guide the juniors assigned to me for college counseling.
[comment]Seriously though this argument is not sound and has absolutely no grounds. Get gud.
[comment]bad take. planned parenthood is for all sorts of sex things. std’s, pregnancy preventions, it’s not really just abortions. and schools aren’t open because that’s about 2000 people in an enclosed space together for 8 hours, not great for covid-19 prevention.
[comment]Come on dude if we send kids back to school this virus is gonna be twice as worse, all it takes is one person to get it and boom hundreds at the school are gonna have it and pass it on to others
[comment]All you conservatives couldn't care less about real children your just a cult of fetus worshipping hypocrites who will surely rot in hell.

[comment]Public schools should always be considered nonessential, planned parenthood being terrible has nothing to do with it.
[comment]Funny thing is... if we got rid of planned parenthood, we would have a huge spike in abortions due to how many pregnancies they prevent. Also in 15+ years there would be an enormous increase in crime.

No one will stop kids going to stop sending kids to school.. until then like every other 150+ countries stay home

[comment]More education is probably occurring now with those brainwashing centers closed down. I have no problem with this.
[comment]Bruh who is against the education of children
[comment]Republicans and their lack of logic and critical thinking skills
[comment]To those out there who think flattening the curve is the cure:

Flattening the curve isn't going to stop the virus.  Too many people keep thinking that the lock down is going to be the cure to stop the virus when the curve is flattened. That's not how this works or has worked or will work.

It's simply helping ease the virus infection rate that *is* going to occur to the same number of people as though we hadn't quarantined. That's the whole point. Expect to get it at some point (if you haven't already had it, and were asymptomatic).

The curve flattening was to help our health system stay on top of it and keep from being over-burdened. It's inevitable that everyone's going to get it eventually. That's an established fact. (again if you haven't already had it and didn't realize it, like the going theory is out in CA)

There *will* likely be a spike in cases for a short (emphasis) period as people start to get back to life and states  (and frankly other countries) start phasing in re-opening their economies, but over time as things warm up, and as immunities build up, the cases will drop.
[comment]Wasn't it the Republican party that under cuts educational programs and after school programs. As I can also recall most red states have been dealing with teacher strikes since they are underpaid and overworked... (only saying since I'm in a red state and my wife is a teacher) so educational standards are not a main priority for Republicans, but controlling women's freedoms and denying them the right to choose is definitely a priority.
[comment]Schools are concentrated areas with hundreds and thousands of kids and planned parenthood has a lot less people at a time and they don't only do abortions they have other functions. I am a Republican btw.
[comment]Insert: Meme about republicans wanting to save all the unborn babies regardless of circumstances, but wanting citizens to die for the economy during a pandemic (quote: Chris Christie, Ken Paxton, etc).
[comment]You probably don't have a family or kids so I wouldn't expect you to understand why someone wouldn't want send their kids to school right now. I don't blame you, I blame your parents.
[comment]Schools are still open they’re just doing on line. Schools are a hotbed for disease, so it makes a lot of sense to do it online
[comment]Yes, I bet you think grouping all of our children into small areas for 7 hours a day during a pandemic is a great idea, don’t you? You’re the type that gives us a bad name.

[comment]I get downvoted to hell for replies like this:

"Social networks today are primary replacement of public forums, they perform same function, have much larger reach, and are more convenient. So, if such network claims they are a platform, they are supposed to follow US laws that protect free speech. Most of the current social networks are more like public utilities when they claim to be platforms. When people analyze things that are being censored, clear pattern is seen which points to a bias towards left on all major platforms. There are many double standards in enforcing the terms and conditions, depending on political leanings of the content in question. This is very unfair, unhealthy, and promotes division among people. Doesn't take a genius to see how bad this is, but giant companies keep using all possible loopholes in the courts in order to avoid facing the consequences of claiming being either a publisher or a platform depending on the case."

[comment]The Donald was the only thing left that was keeping this place from eating itself alive, now they have to hate each other.
[comment]WTF kind of article is that? 🤣 The Left always plays the victim card. The race card. They invent crap like "White Privilege " and a gender gap just so they can pretend to be victims.
[comment]Conservative victim hood? They really just project all of their own stuff onto their opponents to feel better about themselves don't they.
[comment]"&gt; It was likely inevitable that the pandemic would get sucked into the hysteria industrial complex, because that's what right-wing media does with everything.

The best line of the whole article."

This is exactly what the left does with EVERYTHING! How do they do deeply lack any self awareness?
[comment]I don’t often see good responses against the points they’re making in that thread though? How do I know they’re not right about it
[comment]Yeah those libs love their echo chambers. Let me just post and complain about that on a subreddit of people that all agree and think like me.
[comment]Disgusting
[comment]"Why do these people we censor and constantly shit on throughout the media feel oppressed?" -- liberals, probably.

I really have a hard time seeing their behavior as anything but outright evil these days. They know they're persecuting people, they just think those people deserve it, so they shouldn't have a right to complain about the psychosis the media exhibits toward conservatism. They don't think constantly insulting people all over television, in every movie, in books and in all of their coastal 'comedy' acts counts for some reason--and keep in mind, these are people who want to make insulting minorities illegal.
[comment]Reddit over the last 5 years has gone extremely left just take a peak at /r/coronavirus
[comment]Pretty sure there are quite a few bots over there.
[comment]hey look at all us rational thinking folks! didnt know this many of us existed on reddit!
[comment]What a load of Communist (Progresssive) CRAP!!
[comment]It's all communist bot farms in politickkks, in news, in world news, in futurology, in pics and even in advice animals. 

China was only in lockdown for 16 days! They have all gone back to work [injecting bias into your social medias](https://i.imgur.com/pufCv9O.jpg).

[comment]I joined that subreddit when I first got Reddit thinking their would be healthy discussion. Quickly learned it was actually r/liberal and r/fucktrump
[comment]I just posted this there  "Conservative victim hood? Lmao have you spoken with minorities?? THIS IS THE STUPIDEST FKN POST EVER🤣🤣🤣 " I seen someone saying they used to love trolling  in this sub. And it had 56 up votes  so let's do the same ..
[comment]how did we allow it to become this????
[comment]I’m fairly new to reddit and my first decision was to comment a few of my republican viewpoints on r/politics, you can tell by my karma what happened.
[comment]One common claim in that thread is that disagreement isn’t allowed in r/conservative. 

It just isn’t true. I’ve had spirited debates within the subreddit many times.
[comment]This is exactly what the left do, They always accuse you of what they’re guilty of

[comment]This is what JP calls being ideologically possessed.
[comment]So a crime against a woman, which is illegal,  as long as it's someone who the liberal left  want b/c they hate Trump so much. Since Trump isn't supported by those people, a criminal must get into the White House at all costs...regardless if he committed a crime.   I don't care what party you as a politician fall under,  if you have someone come against you with a crime, why can't it be handled the same way it would be handled if it was one of us?  Such as we would be arrested, either put in jail or post bail, there would be an investigation, court, and a judge and jury decides if you're guilty or not.  Why is it different for the ruling politicians, regardless of what party they support.  Why is any crime overlooked in DC if you ask me. It's a joke honestly.
[comment]No. It was never about MeToo or believing women.  It was always and only about power.
[comment]Ok two can play at that, I beleive all the women who accused Trump and Kavanaugh, but I still want them in Office..
[comment]I wonder if they think Tara Reade has to vote for Biden?
[comment]They don’t give a shit about women, it’s all about power and beating trump whatever the cost, I hope centrists and independents observe this.
[comment]God damn if only the DNC could get somebody normal. In my personal opinion I want Donald Trump in office, but to see this go down is terrible, and I hope that in a generation or two most Americans will understand what was going on.
[comment]Ok then "believing" her means absolutely nothing, it's just a thing you say, that's all, there are no consequences except someone will "believe"
[comment]Next level TDS
[comment]For those women who are ok with this being a fact and you are still voting for Biden, he really wants to hire all of you
[comment]Gotta give it up to them for being honest. Still shitty double standard though.
[comment]People with these sentiments are going to regret saying this. It may not be tomorrow or even next year, but some day these words will come back to haunt these people good and hard.   
     
    
Seasons and tastes change, what seems fiercely urgent now will rot like milk. This trend of believing the accuser while voting for the perpetrator is going to leave lasting damage to the agenda of the left.    
   
The Dems need a mission. Their mission was social justice, but that is shown to be a farce. How are they going to woo the independent voter now?    
   
If the dems had just taken a prudent and thought out strategy they could've easily defeated Trump. They are stealing defeat from the jaws of victory. They need a campaign strategy that speaks to the common middle-of-the-road American. They need to cut the hard, edgy activists out and focus on small compromises that will peel Trump's supporters away. Everything they do alienates these voters.   
   
Think about the miners and and factory workers that mother jones organized and unionized in the early 20th century. Those peasants would have no quarter in today's Democrat party. They believed in Christian-based family values, in a strong nation and in second amendment rights.  The left has abandoned this kind of American.  
  
So, in short, the way to defeat Trump is to compromise a little and win these Americans back to the left, not supporting sex predators.
[comment]Not surprised even a little bit.
[comment]This is disgusting. Not unexpected perhaps, but disgusting. I'm still giving Joe the benefit of the doubt as he deserves, but they say they believe he's a rapist yet want him to beat Trump anyways?
[comment]What sane woman would vote Democrat at this point 

[ rhetorical,  we know there are no sane female Democrats]
[comment]"oRaNge MaN bAd!"
[comment]Moral bankruptcy of the left
[comment]They have no shame. It does not surprise me.
[comment]They also believe the many Trump accusers, and the reasoning behind is that if you have to choose between a crappy meal and actual crap, you eat that meal, no matter how crappy it is.
[comment]So they just admitted that none of this #metoo crap had anything to do with justice for women.
[comment]Lost cause. Ignore them and focus on people that still have a chance.
[comment]The left showing once again that they will sacrifice their morals if it means winning.

So desperate..
[comment]Mental illness should not be encouraged and stupidity is not a superpower.
[comment]So Bret Kavanagh is all good now. Glad we cleared that up.
[comment]The DNC is awful and corrupt and I’m not a fan of joe Biden. Having said that, the choice is between someone who has been accused by one woman, or the current president who has been accused by 20+ women. It’s not unreasonable to still vote for Biden when these are your only options.
[comment]That’s honestly disgusting
[comment]Just proves #metoo only works if the person is a republican. It could come out that Biden was just as bad as Jerry Sandusky and people would still vote for him. The silence from the me too movement is deafening.
[comment]Honestly I think you shouldn’t be able to report it 5 years after it happened especially if the person has became famous or rich
[comment]Gotta cheer for the team no matter what.
[comment]It’s (D)ifferent when we do it!
[comment]Joe Biden's support for abortion outweighs any past misdeeds for feminists.
[comment]This makes it clear that the Kavanaugh situation had nothing to do with believing women or caring about sexual assault. They found a guy they didn't like and did everything they could to destroy him. They didn't care with Bill Clinton and they don't care now with Joe Biden. I hope the American people can see through their bull shit.
[comment]Can’t fix stupid!!
[comment]Liberals are pathetic
[comment]"I'm uh Joe Biden, and I forgot this message" he will gets tons of votes because he perfectly relates to his voters...
[comment]I cant wait for the debates. Gonna be a real shitshow. Get the popcorn out.
[comment]I love this picture for 1 reasons: shows a liberal being an idiot
2: it's from an android
[comment]The hypocrisy
[comment]This is the reality we have to deal with. Liberals operate on a different set of morals. Trully vile creatures.
[comment]All of them are shit
[comment]Well if you have to pick a sexual assailant for president, you may as well pick the one who matches you ideologically
[comment]That's literally supporting a rapist and they hate Trump for saying "grab her by the pussy" _bruh_
[comment]It's called the lesser of two evils, if it were up to me I would vote for jeo biden, have Congress impeach and remove him. I don't like democrats or Republicans, feel like this whole 2 party system is the thing dividing America and I feel like both parties hold too much power.
[comment]At least she's honest.
[comment]I mean this is how all people are. You see it all over the place. People idolize politicians when they should be holding them accountable.
[comment]You can stand for anything when you’re spineless statist commie
[comment]In no way do I support Joe biden, ESPECIALLY after this but I feel like everyone here is forgetting the 25 people that have brought to light Trumps sexual misconducts. They are both horrible people at this point its about who people think is worse. I do agree the double standard here is a bit ridiculous, Biden should definitely be held accountable by the people that support him.
[comment]Well the convict did commit mass murder, but he has a dog so lets just give it to a Texas salon owner.
[comment]Honest question, do you guys think sexual assault should disqualify someone from holding public office?
[comment]“I am voting for Biden. But I am so sorry he sexually assaulted you. I believe you but he’s our guy.” Follow the blue, don’t think for yourself. Maybe they should change it to #metoonotsomuchyou.
[comment]She just summed up the left in 160 characters.
[comment]They manipulate everything to their convenience. People are slowly catching on and figuring out how stupid the left is.
[comment]No, they aren't, but on the bright side at least they're completely owning their hypocrisy and exposing themselves to everyone else, especially the moderates. They've gone full retard and it's not a good look.
[comment]This doesn't just make them hypocrites, it makes them look stupid.
[comment]No, they're not joking, just depraved. They are liberals, after all.
[comment]I’m as concerned if not more so about creepy joe’s relationship with China. If you think he’s gonna be the nominee, I can’t see the Dems putting forth a nomination for the poor guy. He’s become a sympathetic character. If I we’re a betting man I don’t think he’ll be the nominee
[comment]These people are pathetic
[comment]“I have no ethics.”
[comment]That article is straight up cancer, justifying voting for a sex offenders entry into office because he'd do more for women there than "the worst president in the history of the republic". She's got the mental faculties of Biden at this stage...
[comment]If it weren’t for double standards, the left would have no standards at all.
[comment]Top comment is splitting hairs, no? The pussy grab is exactly what people are considering. We know he said it, furthermore I believe he conducted himself this way. Biden likely too.

Even anecdotally, in ref to my vote, it is my vote to be swayed, not a criminal accusation with burdens of proof. 

So if they’re both disgusting in reference to women, the other factors play out and this gets ignored.
[comment]Of course they are because the me too movement was full of shit.
[comment]It's actually not that difficult of a concept. Given the option of two rapists, you vote for the rapist that's the least bad. You guys are voting for the rapist with an (R) next to his name, so you have no right to judge people who vote for Biden. They're doing the same thing you are.
[comment]What a lot of people don’t seem to grasp is that most Democrats believe all of Trumps accusers are telling the truth and that the infamous grab em by the pussy tape is an actual confession of sexual assault.  So it’s literally voting between 2 sex offenders for president.  And if you use that logic, Biden has raped less women than Trump.  

Just gonna put that out there and say that I’m not a Republican, but I like to try to understand the assumptions people have.
[comment]It would help if we all recognize that the primary process as it currently works is failing all around (not just Dems).  We are in transition from a time when stage one of the primary process occurred out of sight before a single vote is cast, to a time when voters are given more opportunity to select from a much wider field of candidates.  The flip side of this is that in a field with a large the number of strong candidates, the winner might prevail with a small plurality, and could even be opposed by a large majority within their own party.

With that said, here's the view from the other side:

In the highly likely event that Biden is the nominee, I will face a choice between

* Candidate B:  one credible accusation of assault and known behavior that has made some women uncomfortable,  but supports many of my policy preferences and has demonstrated experience in legislative and executive governance.
* Candidate T: many accusations of assault, admitted to sexual assault as a basic way of interacting with women in certain settings, admitted to using ownership of the Miss Universe Pageant as an excuse for walking in on naked teens, also supports few if any of my policy preferences and has demonstrated incompetence in response to a global crisis.

Where is the hypocrisy here in pulling the level for Candidate B, if this is what the choice looks like from my side of the aisle?
[comment]I’m making a principled vote for someone I believe to be an actual rapist. That’s some really galaxy brain shit.
[comment]Policy over party
[comment]We should not be shocked by this type of response. Sheeple are and obedient group. It's not about right or wrong. This is all about reversing that fat L they took in 2016, by any means necessary. And I do mean by ANY means necessary.
[comment]#Metoo was always a political weapon.  They are just pissed now that it's turned on one of theirs, but should we really be surprised by this reaction.  After all this isn't the first time Democrats have voted for a rapist.
[comment]We’re not going to win until we take back the schools and teach this our values to children.

This type of stupidity is learned.
[comment]I’m not saying doing this is justified, but the exact same thing happened with republicans during the 2012 election.
[comment]Bertha here will be Joe Biden’s rubbing mate because he thinks the kamakazis are coming back from the German imperial space army of Moscow

[comment]Sure it is. But thinking with logic and reason doesn’t feed the media cycle and strengthen all the petty tyrants that masquerade as our country’s political figures.
[comment]Let’s appoint some IGs so we can make sure the Bailout money is going where it’s supposed to. Let’s enact laws to force American companies to start making tests (which should have been done months ago). Then once we have adequate testing let’s open the economy back up. But we need a National response, not just piece mailing individual states responses.
[comment]Agreed
[comment]If you're not aware of all of those things then you're not being logical or aware, at all.
[comment]Accurate.
[comment]This is me, absolute destruction of a global economy is coming, and it scares the shit out of me.
[comment]One of my friends thinks that the virus is fake bc he’s never seen a human with it
[comment]I feel entirely too validated by OP and the top comment. (‘Petty tyrants’)
[comment]They aren't letting a crisis go to waste.  Trillion dollar spending spree?  Massive authoritarian crackdown they will only partially retreat from?  A politician in a crisis is a kid in a candy store.
[comment]It's certainly possible to believe all three, but that doesn't really change the fact that we need to maintain our social distancing policies for a while longer.

It's fair to be concerned about the state of the economy, but it will get better once the crisis has passed and we can all go outside and start buying things again. Dead people can't participate in commerce, so we're better off in the long run by focusing on minimizing infection rates.

It's fair to be concerned about authoritarian power grabs, but millions of Americans could die if we're not careful about this, as opposed to the tens of thousands who already have. We shouldn't be looking at this as the government taking freedoms away from us, we should be looking at it as Americans working together against a common enemy.

People have been throwing around ideas like opening up the country "slowly," but that doesn't really mean anything. It's not a balancing act between the economy and human lives. We either lose some people and harm the economy, or we lose even more people and inflict greater harm to the economy. That's our choice.

If an organization of doctors, nurses, and health experts with medical degrees were leading the charge for opening the country, then I would think it's the right time, but it's not. The charge for opening the country is being led by geriatrics, tacticool militias, and sovereign citizens with Facebook pages. They're not the ones we should be listening to right now.
[comment]Yes...  But good luck having an intelligent exchange of ideas with anyone convinced we should all be locked in our homes awaiting the impending doom of civlization.
[comment]It pains me that many republicans are protesting against social distancing for reasons like “getting their hair cut”. So what if we have the freedom and rights to be outside? If you love this country stay home and keep our people safe
[comment]But if you care about people losing their jobs and consider a tiered opening of the country it means you want to open up the country tomorrow with no restrictions and you want everyone to die
[comment]Need a circle for "People that don't want any form of socialism and want very little government interference.....but willingly take government handouts and bailouts and cry foul when they get sick and the medical care in the country is horrendous".
[comment]I don't think these are equal though. I think people taking the virus and these lockdowns seriously, is of the upmost importance. This virus isn't a joke, it already killed 40,000 Americans, and over 750,000 are infected. The death rate figure might reach 200,000. That's the entire population of Boise, Idaho. That's horrifying. These lockdowns have been proven to be effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. People protesting for the states to reopen are idiots, and what they're doing is dangerous.

Once this virus calms down in a few months then we'll tackle the other two things, which are also very important.
[comment]Do you guys really think governors are enjoying the current situation? Currently these governors have the public eye on them constantly. Their states are running out of money. People on both sides are going to be upset no matter what choices they make in response to the virus, and I’m sure their re-election chances have vastly shifted. 

No one wants the economy of the states and country to  suffer, but that’s the situation we’re in. It’s pretty insane to me that people think governors are destroying their state economies on purpose for “power”. There’s no power without money or people on your side, and governors are currently losing both.
[comment]That’s me in a nutshell
[comment]100% such a tricky balance to maintain. I believe as long as the majority of us do our best to stay sane and hold our leaders to making their decisions on facts and not feelings, we'll pull through this thing alright.

[comment]That's a very rational place to be OP.
[comment]Don’t tell democrats. They want to bury the economy so they can drive up unemployment, increase government assistance (control) and use the opportunity to try to get rid of Trump.
[comment]Thank you! I'm right with you!
[comment]Yes me too. But I have no problem taking the chance on covid just to not let these liberals use this to their advantage ,so open the US for business

[comment]Good for you sir or ma'am. 

it's amazing how many people on the Reddit front page, especially in the news or worldnews subs are either gullible or just sheep that they are willing to be led by the nose by these governors, using the guise of "public safety".
[comment]So, I can't post it, as it was immediately removed... however, a man in Ohio just passed away due to the virus who had complained to the Gov about all the closings. Perhaps he should have been spending more time researching how to stay safe, just a thought. I feel bad for his family, of course and take no pleasure in anyone's death. But it is a bit ironic. I don't want to post a link as it will be removed, but Google it, it will come up.
[comment]Is this post worried about the Trump administration overreaching and threatening the rights of American citizens?
[comment]Can we have an extra circle for drinking bleach?
[comment]I feel this post hits the nail on the head. I am a republican conservative and believe we should take the virus seriously. However some states such as California and Nevada are taking this out of proportion. We cannot be confined to our homes that long and simply watch the economy fall. I believe we should all have the choice to quarantine or not. Millions of people are now unemployed and suffering from poverty. However I also believe that those that are high risk such as my grandparents (70) (78) or other people over the age of 50 or those with underlying conditions. We all need to face the virus and gain herd immunity. To conclude far too many people are suffering from poverty and unemployment to continue this mandatory lockdown any longer. But as I said I feel all high risk people such as those with underlying conditions should continue their quarantine. 

Post scripture
Very few or no healthy people under the age of 50 with no underlying conditions have died from this virus. There are viruses that are far more deadly that we’re not quarantining for such as TB. We need to face this virus and get over it, the curve has been flattened hospitals will no longer be flooded.

How did Candace figure us out? Was she in our trans friendly locker room?
[comment]I have voted by mail twice in my life. Once by absentee ballot that I mailed in due to an injury preventing me from getting to the polling center, and the other time, due to having to vote while in the middle of college (I wasn't going to drive all the way home in the middle of a school week, just to punch a ballot).
[comment]Candace is on point with the predictions
[comment]If there is a chance that fraud could happen with mail in voting then it will erode people's confidence in the system, especially in close contests. There is already a huge divide between Dems and reps, this will only serve to exacerbate it. Unnecessarily in my opinion.
[comment]My liberal friend keep saying that there are no studies to support the idea of mail in voter fraud. Can anyone find me a reputable study that shows mail in voter fraud?
[comment]Oh I’m sure this party wants to keep it out of mail so that can rig it. These bus narratives don’t help and aren’t accurate.
[comment]I mean people can go to grocery stores where you’re way more likely to get the coronavirus than going to vote. I mean hell abortion is deemed an essential business but heaven forbid you go vote, to a gym, or in some areas even set your kid on a play date, play catch with your kid, or buy seed from Home Depot. The laws are all the place. I bet if trump said to delay the 2020 election the democrats would start pushing for everything to be back to normal real fast. Just for the record, I think delaying the election is an awful idea and very unconstitutional. It would send democrats into full on panic mode

[comment]I still find it wild that Americans hold a genuine belief that mail-in/postal votes would be a hot spot for voter fraud. Genuine question here but why do so many of you believe that? Never happened in the UK and we've had postal votes longer than I've been alive and has been available to anyone for 20 years.
[comment]Well according to CNN's front page today, the pandemic is getting worse not better. smh
[comment]Republicans suppress voters and gerrymander districts to win elections. You people are so delusional. I don't even like democrats, but the pure hypocrisy here is crazy
[comment]I think either way, we are going to have a problem. In my state of Wisconsin, Republicans we're excited that voting in person was still going to happen because that meant that there will be low voter turnout and a lot of absentee ballots. After the election backfired on them and they lost a spot in the Supreme Court, all the Republicans claimed the election was rigged and that there were a lot of absentee ballots that never got sent it. Doesn't matter what the result is, the outcome is going to have a lot of drama.
[comment]You forgot the part where Democrats start blaming this on global warming, and then racism somehow.
[comment]Yes lets skip to the part where we follow the lead of every other first world democratic country and allow mail in ballots for those who would be endangered by exposing themselves to this virus or, in regular circumstances, are too busy working  because the government will not support an election day with a national holiday so everyone can vote.

[comment]We need to declare it a national holiday already. That way it can’t be rigged through mail, and we also won’t have to hear the squeakers claim “NoT EVeRboDY GOT ThE ChaNCE TO VoTE” as if it’s the working class that doesn’t get the chance to vote, as opposed to the democrats collecting their government checks or working 8 hour jobs?

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/3z9u4jpovih41.jpg[comment]No no no, women should be able to fuck constantly and with no consequences! It's only fair...?
[comment]Feminist is just another word for a whore.
[comment]Personally I don’t think abortion should be legal in those circumstances. Why punish a child for their parent’s crime?
[comment]I say just get the government out of governing people’s bodies and stay away from my guns too while they’re at it.
[comment]YoU eViL wHiTe MeN jUsT wAnT tO cOnTrOl WoMeNs BoDiEs BeCaUsE yOu ArE sExIsT
[comment]IMO the abortion debate is less about the act itself but more when we consider life to begin. Whether that’s conception, a heartbeat, birth, or some other arbitrary point in time.
[comment]Feminists? Really?
[comment]There would be a lot of false rape claims. Oh wait....
[comment]I may be over simplifying it but is the DNC procedure not the cure for both rape and incest? Is that incorrect? Not a doctor
[comment]If a woman can choose whether or not to abort the baby without the fathers consent because she doesn’t want it, then the father should be able to choose if he has to pay child support or not, without the mothers consent because he doesn’t want it. 

But they ain’t ready for that talk. It’s all “let’s push for women to have MORE rights than men in the name of ‘equality’!”
[comment]I’m totally pro-life but sooooo many more woman would have false rape accusations.
[comment]Committing another horrible act doesn't make the original horrible act go away. The child is innocent.
[comment]I would stand behind the view of a doctor, whose knowledge exceeds ours. If the first trimester doesn’t qualify as a full-born child, then I’d find that acceptable. If the second trimester qualifies as a full-born child, then it’s not acceptable.
[comment]It honestly should not be legal until we have a general consensus on when life begins. Why is abortion legal with so many unanswered questions and somethign like smoking weed isn't. We know just about all there is to know with something like that and they are still cautiously going about legalizing it, but we cant make up our minds on abortion but of course we should be having them.

I understand people believe weed should be illegal but in that case so should tobacco and alcohol. But in this case i was just using it as an example since it is still a relatively popular and current topic.
[comment]Yeah but people like Ted Cruz dont want that. Some of these pro life people dont care about that kid once it pops out.
[comment]The way I see it is, if it threats the mother's life or will be suffering from a disfiguration and have a life in pain it's ok. Personally, in rape setting up for adoption is the best.
[comment]Have never once seen anyone say “We need abortion FOR rape and incest”
[comment]I believe it should still be a liberty a woman has as a free American, especially if the pregnancy could harm/ put the mother or the offspring at risk for complication.
[comment]I still disagree. If you believe that abortion is murder, then why do the evil actions of one human being justify the murder of an innocent human being?
[comment]So you should kill the child just because of the dad?
[comment]Wait, so why is incest morally wrong? It's 2 consenting adults doing what they please with their own bodies, correct?
[comment]Does the way conception occurs decrease the value of the life?
[comment]Why would we allow them for rape and incest anyways? What specifically about rape and incest make a baby worth less than if they were born out of normal sexual relations. To me it is hypocritical that some who can call themselves prolife are fine with killing babies who were conceived through rape and incest.
[comment]I've always thought about the abortion debate with the following logic game:

Can we first agree that there is \*real\* scientific debate over when exactly life begins? As in, there's no exact agreed-upon definition. So with \*that\* said, can we agree that the point at which life begins is a hard scientific gray area?

That only leads us to one of two possible scenarios of legal and widespread abortion:

Either millions of "potential" lives are cut off for a myriad of reasons up to and including pure convenience of the "mother". 

OR  
We are allowing mass genocide in numbers that are unfathomable.

Seems like an easy exercise in figuring out which side you should err on.
[comment]I don't think a blanket law should be applied here. Should be case by case. Should it be used as birth control? No. The fetus isn't developing properly and likely won't survive birth and if it does it would be severely challenged with hardly any quality of life or risk the life of the mother or some other medical hang ups that may occur. Those are things that should be considered. They might already be I don't know. But an outright ban isn't the answer.
[comment]Rape and incest only contributes to 2% of committed abortions, such a minority of cases are seen as the very reason it exists. Smh.
[comment]You know if we increased sex ed and contraceptive funding we would actually cut down on abortions needed for accidental pregnancies but \[y'all ain't interested in that]([https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/377304-abstinence-only-education-making-a-comeback-under-trump))
[comment]This comic isn’t really accurate because there are 7 republicans controlled states that don’t allow abortion on even in the case of rape and abortion. Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio, don’t make exceptions for rape or incest cases. That’s about 15% of all States, and about 32% of republican controlled states. So I’m not really sure what this comic is trying to say.
[comment]NOT GOOD ENOUGH REEE!

[selftext]https://v.redd.it/djby53wvsvk41[comment]Democrat men. 

&amp;#x200B;

Republican men would have LOVED to see her become the nominee.
[comment]"We need to support more women... I didn't support Elizabeth Warren." That's all I heard.
[comment]They have been blaming men for a while now. You kind of get use to it.
[comment]I bought into the Indian heritage. She could be lying that she’s a woman. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.
[comment]Maybe there needs to be better women candidates? Just a wild guess though
[comment]We literally almost elected a woman in 2016.
[comment]Actually.

I'd love to see a strong female Republican in office.

Ivanka Trump 2024?

Edit: Nikki Haley 2024?
[comment]xv
[comment]Candice Owen's bro I'd vote for her
[comment]She’s also a racist
[comment]Warren logic: Verbally attacks white males throughout campaign. Can't understand why white males won't back her.
[comment]Imagine if the first female president is a republican lmao. This view would probably change real quick
[comment]There's still one woman of color in the race. Why not talk about her? Oh right, she doesn't fall into the MSNBC corporate guidelines.
[comment]As a republican woman, I can tell you, it doesn't phase me one bit, that there hasn't been a woman president. Wanting a woman or a man as a president is a very stupid factor to take into account when picking a President of our Great Nation. It just **doesn't matter**.
[comment]They say that but what if it was a Republican woman running for President?
[comment]Fun fact: 2/3 of the women who voted in the Democratic Primary in Massachusetts (her own state) didn't vote for her.

Tell me again how men are to blame for that?

Edit: a letter
[comment]Let's all give men a round of applause. 

Thanks, guys, for your service to this country.
[comment]BRB, going to go flog myself for being male. Sorry everyone! /S
[comment]Is there zero up/down votes on the comments here for anyone else?
[comment]Warren is a hysterical lunatic and never stood a snowball's chance in hell of becoming President.
[comment][Let me explain why you're a horrible person and I'm actually the greatest](https://imgur.com/a/Ycban1h)

edit: just take your ball and go home. Run a better candidate next time. You're not getting a consolation presidency
[comment]What if they are not good enough? Like Warren and HRC.....I’m not going to support someone just because of their gender. It’s stuff like this that made me walk away.
[comment]So all that’s left is Biden, Bernie, and Tulsi? Why doesn’t she endorse Tulsi then?
[comment]Give me a strong Republican woman and I'll vote for her.

[comment]Democratic men are to blame?
[comment]hey, i liked tulsi gabbard! too bad the two women that had the biggest support were the two worst candidates ive ever seen! warren and kamala harris! lol!
[comment]Didn't they have Tulsie Gabbert? She was much stronger than Warren. And she got attacked by her own party of tolerance. Spare us the hypocrisy of they left. Fact is they are nothing more than the party of words and virtue signaling.
[comment]MSDNC
[comment]Haley 2024
[comment]Put up a Decent woman nominee and I will vote for her. My wife on the other hand thinks only a man should be present.  I think the most qualified should be.
[comment]I want the best choice from all my options to represent my voice the best and lead the country in a way I find suitable. I don't care what side of the aisle, what's between your legs, or what skin tone you are.

Gabbard had a fair chance for me. Warren wasn't it. Pick a competent woman, and I'll vote for her if she's the best choice.
[comment]May the spirit of the eagle bless her with a safe return to her teepee on the prairie.
[comment]I could only tolerate 30 seconds of her. My God, everything about her is annoying to listen to.
[comment]This is the equivalent of, "I'm not racist, I am friends with a black guy" for liberals. No no no, not YOu guys, but everyone else with a penis.
[comment]Your'e welcome, everybody!
[comment]I for one, can’t wait till the Republicans have a viable woman candidate. Nikki Haley will possibly be Trumps VP on this ticket and I would vote for her in a hot second after Trumps next 4 years. I’m sure women on the left would call Haley a lackey token who is doing men’s bidding.
[comment]We’ll have to see what happens when the Republican candidate is a strong conservative woman agains a male Democrate...

I really dont care about the gender of the president. My focus lies with their policy and how good they’ll be able to serve. Im not going to vote for a woman if there’s a man I agree more with just because ‘we need to support women’, because thats literally sexist...
[comment]Women always seem to need men to blame their setbacks and failures on.
[comment]As a woman I get so tired of hearing from so-called feminists that I’m “voting against my interests” or betraying my sex by not supporting democrats or women. As if I can’t decide what’s in my best interest for myself. If we get a female president, cool, but I’m not going to vote for someone like Warren or Hillary just because I’m desperate for a female to be president.
[comment]Sorry, but mainstream America just wasn’t buying her “I’m America’s grandma who is just like you, but also 1/1024th Native American, and totally not a wealthy elite white”. Plus, doesn’t look good when you’re the Massachusetts senator, and you come in third in Massachusetts in the state primary.
[comment]Ivanka Trump 2024.
[comment]I really don't think too many people have a problem with a woman being president.

When there's a woman candidate with some good policies they'll get votes.
[comment]They will blame literally anyone else before they take the blame themselves for their own failings
[comment]Can Somebody explain to her how feminist that sounds. And at the end she criticizes herself by saying she wouldn't have voted for any of them anyways. Dumb dumb dumb
[comment]I keep having this sneaky suspicion that Biden is a sort of Trojan Horse, and right at the end, the Dems will switch to Tulsi before the GOP can properly react. 

Sounds crazy, but I’ll be really surprised if Biden goes all the way to Election Day.
[comment]She needs to calm down Tulsi is still in this election if she wants a woman president so badly.
[comment]You Stupid Bitch
[comment]Then put yourself in a position worth the leadership. Duh.
[comment]We as republicans should put a woman as president just so we can finally get democrats and feminists to shut the fuck up already.
[comment]A truly independent woman would support the best person for the job, no matter the race, sex, or sexual orientation. I still am hopeful a woman runs who actually is the best person for the job. I’ll totally throw my support their way and vote accordingly. We just haven’t had that happen yet.
[comment]isn't like...                 

half the country women lmao
[comment]If Leezy ran for president I would quit my job tomorrow to campaign for her. What says you?
[comment]We’re sorry
[comment]The irony.  We wamens need men in order to be president.
[comment]Here’s a thought, maybe we should vote people in based on actual votes rather than “well she’s a woman and we’ve never had one of those before so why not”
[comment]So I can't just judge her on her opinions and ideas?  I have to see if she has any woo hoos sticking out and vote on that?
[comment]We must all racist against fake American Indians.
[comment]Well, two men are since they won the majority of the delegates and she didn't.
[comment]I dont want women in leadership positions. It never goes well, ask boeing.
[comment]If there is a woman that would run that shows competence for the position, people would vote for her. So far it’s been between Hillary and Warren, neither of which are behind policies that the majority want.
[comment]How about we just elect the best person for the job and stop making everything about sex and race?
[comment]I vote for the person who I think will do what’s best for the country. These identity politics are really blinding the Left from seeing reason!
[comment]Warren is a straight out thief.   It's amazing that a woman of color would support her in any way.   Warren continues to be listed as the first person of color to receive tenure at Harvard Law School.  She has stolen this title from someone who actually served it
[comment]Just seems like a weird concept “There hasn’t been a women president yet so we should support female candidates”. Shouldn’t we pick the most trusted/qualified/intelligent candidate?
[comment]I would have voted for a condoleezza rice and she is a black female and I'm a white male. To be honest I probably would have voted for her over Donald Trump at first. Knowing now what I know I'm glad she didn't run against him cause I'm not sure if we would've ever gotten another shot with trump.
[comment]I bet she’s a certified yoga instructor.
[comment]How about I want to vote for the most qualified person regardless of their phallic status?
[comment]Present me with a woman running for President that has a platform I agree with, who believes in the things I believe in and I will vote for her
[comment]over half of democratic voters are women.
[comment]Put up a woman worth voting for.
[comment]I gave money to Carly Fiorina's campaign because I thought she was smart and I liked her philosophy, so I do not need a lecture.  Rather than scold men for not voting for your candidate, maybe you should have some humility and ask yourself what you did wrong.
[comment]Of course the left will blame men. Because some women are apparently not yet advanced enough to admit our own screw ups and say "I couldn't get it done." We're only advanced enough to blame men. Will it ever occur to pathological lying sociopath Warren Out that her constant lies did her in.
[comment]I would vote for a black 40 year old woman who is a Republican then a 75 year old white guy democrat.
[comment]We elect someone based on the content of their character not the composition of their chromosomes.
[comment]But I thought democrats were all inclusive and equality supporting? How dare they not support a woman!
[comment]Refused to vote for a pathological liar?  Must be sexism.
[comment]I'll gladly vote for a SMART women for president. There are plenty of business women out there that I think could do a good job. Warren just is dumb and not for the American people.
[comment]I’m not gonna vote for someone whos an idiot and has terrible ideas just cause they’re a woman. So no, you shouldn’t necessarily want more women presidents. We should want the best president. And if that happens to be a women then that’s fine. They have everything backwards.
[comment]I agree.  Men are to blame.  

I can’t be her amazingly low turnout.  Or her history of being the worst kind of race pimp.  Or the blatant dirty tricks she used openly on people like on Sanders.  Or her profound fakeness.  Her willingness to lie about literally anything.

It was men.

*-No, not like that.*
[comment]She's about 50% right.
[comment]A woman won the popular vote in 2016 tf you on about
[comment]It's easier to blame a group for an alleged wrongdoing rather than focus on an ineffective clown
[comment]„Why should a woman settle for a number 2 job? " Because she wasn't good enough for number 1? Why would we choose the most important person in the world for four years based on gender? That's so stupid
[comment]Good lord ok ima day it( coming from a woman here) I don’t want a woman president if she isn’t good. Not only is that bad for our country, but it makes the idea of a woman president look bad for the future and therefore people won’t be likely to vote for one again.
[comment]There will never be a time on this earth that I would ever listen to even one thing this man-hating, lecturing, old battle axe would have to say.  I don't care if you think thats misogynist or whatever.  She is just a nasty elitist history teacher no nothing spouting her hateful rhetoric only trying like hell to control everything you do and say.  Screw her.  Bye Felicia.
[comment]Well, not conservative men...
[comment]But men are to blame! Blame Joe and Bernie for getting more votes.

[comment]Serious question: why is this a Republican v Democrat issue? 
This whole lock down vs not thing seems more like an Authoritarian v Libertarian thing to me.
[comment]This is what we miss in California and what we need more of. But when this shows up in the r/politics sub, this man will be crucified for aiding and abetting death because he won't arrest people for being outdoors. There are zero constitutional laws that allow life and liberty to be taken from us due to a virus. How long is this going to go on due to Democrat despair over their next POTUS loss? Instead of robbing us of our freedom and very lives, maybe the left should try to get their party together and stop the hysterics.
[comment]Reposting my comment from the /r/conservative post of this same video:

&gt; Just a reminder that not all California is "California." We might have more registered democrats than any other state (about 8.5M , or 44% of our registered voters). But we still have a shit-ton of republicans too. Even though its only 25% of our registered voters that are republicans, that's more than 4.5M. 

&gt; Texas may be the only state with more republican voters but the data I pulled from says Texas doesn't register by party so I don't know what they actually have.

&gt; Just saying not to write all of us off. I'd say at least half of our counties are solidly republican. A lot of them may have smaller populations but they're there.

&gt; We also have more independents than any other state, something like 4.8M (more than republicans). If even 25% of these voted (R), thats still 1.2M, more than some states total registered voters.

[comment]I mean.. it is a publicly traded company, not a government run organization. To ever think it was neutral whichever way they want to lean is a little crazy.
[comment]Use another platform. It’s a free country.
[comment]Twitter is a voluntary platform, if you don’t want to adhere to their TOS then you are free to go elsewhere. Trying to make social media be in line with government agenda is an unnecessary line to cross.
[comment]It's a public company, they can do what they like with their company, if you don't like it build your own or don't use it. Just like a baker can refuse to serve a gay couple Twitter can do the same
[comment]I don’t think it’s a question of neutrality either.

Twitter is calling people out on their obvious bullshit now and let’s face it, if you want to get somebody angry call them out on their bullshit without any evidence. In this case at least it’s passing some sort of marginal fact check it’s not just willy-nilly opinion masquerading as news. Some things are only debatable to a small group.

Also this executive is constantly going back to make corrections to what he said. Folks still want reliable info.
[comment]It’s a private company. But let’s not let that stop us from supporting this idiotic EO.

Why is everyone surprised that the most high-profile user got flagged but tons of small users who say stupid things aren’t being censored? Gee, I don’t know, maybe put a half second of thought into it.
[comment]The commenters in this thread who dislike the Executive Order need to read up about Platforms vs Publishers and read how the Order did not do anything, it just clarified that the companies were liable for editorializing content under an already existing law.  
  
It doesnt matter if you are a private company. Newpapers who are private companies dont get to publish anything they want either.
[comment]In my opinion It is waaaaay more neutral than reddit but less than facebook.
[comment]Everyone already knew Twitter is a dumpster fire, even my friends said Twitter is nasty and to delete it. Lol
[comment]I'm conflicted about this. Yes, Twitter and Facebook are private companies that should not be responsible for what messages are expressed on their platforms, but would anyone think it's acceptable for your ISP or telephone provider to block an email or phone call if their algorithm detected that you were saying something that went against their political ideologies? Twitter and Facebook have become primary methods of human contact, much like email and telephone. Allowing such a company the authority to decide what beliefs are ok to express or not goes against the basic principle of free speech.
[comment]The fact theyve allowed him to stay on the platform spewing hate and false information for all these years shows they really arent leaning left like all yall suddenly seem to think.
They censored a tweet from the POTUS talking about shooting americans. They left his “only good democrat is a dead democrat” tweet alone though. He lost the popular vote so what he thinks over half of the voting population should be killed? What a joke of a country lmao
[comment]I never did pretend is was a neutral platform...

Who ever did? Who still is?

And neither is Reddit. It's as far left as you can get.
[comment]It's time to stop pretending any platform is neutral.
[comment]Yea let’s focus on the pandemic and record unemployment.
[comment]social media is a failed experiment in humanity
[comment]Time to stop pretending  reddit and all of social media are neutral.  I'm starting to think all of social media is a cancer on the planet for healthy societies
[comment]Everyone knows Twitter blows.
[comment]Nothing is a neutral platform anymore. I only see one side of the news on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, IG, etc.
[comment]...ALL social media platforms ! Not just Twitter
[comment]Losing CDA 230 immunity and federal advertising revenue will hurt. Hope the Board is ready for shareholder lawsuits.
[comment]I'm very hesitant to tread down this path. Anybody notice the stickied comment on every post in this sub?

&gt; /r/Republican is a partisan subreddit

The government pulling platform status is dangerous for everybody. We can be mad that lots of people use twitter and point out twitter is often wrong but once you pull out the dinner table cloth there's no easy way of putting it back
[comment]When I joined the various social platforms I had the expectation of neutrality.
[comment]I made a comment on some lefty site to that effect and got pummeled with down votes. 
Convinced Reddit is controlled by communist China/looney left.

...and to answer the naysayer’s, Twitter has certain protection as a medium or platform and individual’s post on that platform. They get protection because they make no judgement on posts, only provide the means to express the idea. 
When you inject yourself as an arbiter of content, your a publisher in the digital age.
[comment]This is so good. What you guys have to do to make things like this sound something near normal. House is under fire but hey, everything´s fine and under control. Twitter was fine until two days ago. But now they are the enemy. You don´t like a bit but they will resist your lunatic
[comment]When did we start?
[comment]At least i can see others ferrets here.
Twatter is the biggest joke. I was booted for a week for saying all pedos should hang. 

You would think they wouldn't be against that.
[comment]So Twitter is a little biased so let’s start a bill to try to take it down?
[comment]Why have republicans suddenly decided they hate the concept of private property? Feckless communists. Y'all are the same as democrats now. Ridiculous.
[comment]Well I mean it is a private company so they can swing whichever way they want. Zuck criticised what they did but his company is also private so they’re both entitled to doing things in different ways
[comment]Twitter is trash
[comment]Never once did I think it was neutral. It’s a cesspool for SJWs.
[comment]It sucks man. Jack forces me against my will and MAKES me use twitter instead of the other dozen social media sites. FUCK HIM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]If Democrats nominate Bernie Sanders, they hand the election to Trump
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/if-democrats-nominate-bernie-sanders-they-hand-the-election-to-trump[comment]Don't know about that. I'd vote for Bernie over Trump.
[comment]Disagree.

I think Bernie, an independent in Congress, is the shakeup America needs. He's got an "American First" attitude without the War on Drugs and leads in donations from people, not Corporations.

The DNC hates him so he's doing something right lol
[comment]Bernie would absolutely tank the economy so Wall Street would get behind Trump. Trump will easily beat him. 




Bernie is a self admitted socialist, and that should be terrifying for Americans to hear. This man touted Venezuela as a great model before the inevitable happened there. Hell, he honeymooned in the USSR. Bernie is socialist scum deceiving easily tricked naive college students.
[comment]I remember during the West Virginia primaries in 2016 news stations were asking people who they supported. People were supporting Bernie. When asked who they planned on voting for if Bernie didn’t get the nomination they answered with Trump.
[comment]If Bernie is nominated trump is in big trouble imo. Anyone else and he easily wins
[comment]Bernie will destroy Trump if Trump doesn't destroy himself first.
[comment]Bernie is the only one who recognizes the dangers of climate change. Elect anyone else and New York will probably go underwater within 20 years. Gives a whole new meaning to Wall Street is sinking
[comment]Tbf if they nominate Biden, they do the same
[comment]It's funny because over to the other side, the people voting Democrat say Bernie is the only who can beat Trump.
[comment]If they nominate anyone other than Joe Biden, they had it to Trump
[comment]People with big money dont want Bernard to tank the economy, so big money would silently push President Trump (even if they dont want him overall) because they vote with their brains and wallets.

Imagine telling a bunch of very rich and powerful people who either directly or by proxy employee millions that they will make a lot less money forever until the Socialism BS is out in total. "hey, give up your money" is a great selling point? LOL
[comment]I honestly believe the only person who can beat Trump is Michelle and even that will be a close one. Even then..VOTE
[comment]Holy Bernie brigade!
[comment]I don’t know, the Democrat Elites can’t win the working man, and Bernie has proven he can in places like West Virginia. Maybe he can’t beat Trump, but at the same time maybe he’d come closer than another Dem Elitist.
[comment]It’s important to point out that every democrat said Trump had no chance of beating Hillary, and here we are.
[comment]I think Biden is the only serious candidate. The rest of the communists are just to far to the left.
[comment]Never take that for granted though. No one thought Trump could ever beat Hillary.
[comment]If they nominate Bernie, Biden or Warren, they hand the election to Trump. All three candidates are unelectable.
[comment]Bernie is 5 bridges too far
[comment]If you happen to see my F150 and it has a Trump sticker and a Bernie Sanders sticker, now you know why.
[comment]I disagree. I think Sanders will be trouble for Trump bec he speaks the same language of appeasing workers and bringing back jobs. Also, single payer healthcare is popular with both sides of the aisle.
[comment]If any Democrat faces Trump it's an easy Trump landslide. Biden is corrupt and senile. Talking about kids rubbing his hairy legs at the pool. Warren is full of crap, lying about everything, and pandering to everybody. Buttigieg is a young kid that can't run South Bend let alone the country.
[comment]There’s only one logical thing to do then! Republican Party should back Bernie to ensure Trump’s success!
[comment]Trump’s winning regardless of Democrat at this point.
[comment]I respectfully disagree with the title.  It should be replaced with "If Democrats nominate anyone , they hand the election to Trump".
[comment]I believe the election is a bit too far to make such a claim.
[comment]I can't see Bernie getting the nod. I have a feeling it will either be Biden or Warren. Trump would mop the floor with Bernie. Not to mention Obama has said Bernie is not a Democrat and that he would discourage voters from voting his way if it came to it. It also doesn't look good that he refuses to endorse his own former VP. Either way, Im voting Trump in 2020.
[comment]It’s going to be Bloomberg vs Trump
[comment]I’m afraid Sanders is the most formidable. Vermont is a fairly conservative state and he has won there for decades.
[comment]If they nominate Biden, Trump wins easily. Sanders though I think might have a fighting chance.
[comment]That would also make AOC the leader of the Democratic party. l doubt Pelosi and Schumer will let it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Picture of Obama’s staff welcoming President Trump on his 1st day at the White House... and here’s the Whistle-Blower aka Eric Ciaramella.

[comment]look at all those pissy children
[comment]Why are they so mad!! They got 2 terms!!!
[comment]Have you noticed how almost all women and minorities no longer work there.
[comment]lol what a bunch of babies
[comment]They don't ask how he got a hold of the call
[comment]proof of the deep state
[comment]Macaulay Culkin?
[comment]It’s very telling that the Republicans rhetoric has been focused around the perceived political bias Of the whistleblower and not directed at the actual content of the claim. 

Does anyone really think it appropriate that the president withheld aid to compel the Ukrainians to announce an investigation?
[comment]Holy shitttt nice find
[comment]Talk about lack of self awareness. Such arrogance!
[comment]Priceless.
[comment]What a bunch of smug, arrogant, jerks. No class, grace, or dignity in the face of democracy.
[comment]Washington DC is certainly Hollywood for ugly people.
[comment]Soooo much salt
[comment]"we rigged this, how did this happen?"
[comment]Lackeys.
[comment]It’s on Trump for not canning every single one of those pussies. He should have cleaned house. At least he can say he tried to retain Obama holdovers and it was a mistake and he won’t be doing it anymore.
[comment]Wtf whistleblowers are protected by the law. The fact the president insists on uncovering his identity is already fucked up
[comment]&gt; **Picture of Obama’s staff welcoming President Trump on his 1st day at the White House... and here’s the Whistle-Blower aka Eric Ciaramella.** 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a picture of his staffer's listening to one of his last speeches as he congratulates President-elect Trump.
[comment]Love this picture so much.
[comment]Lol these smug assholes.
[comment]looks like all the other angry dems lol
[comment]They all look so happy.
[comment]The "tolerant" left
[comment]Snowden's brother?
[comment]One thing this situation will guarantee is that incoming presidents will completely clean house of all the old staffers from non-aligned parties.
[comment]And their joyless expressions are really windows into their empty spaces where their souls would be.
[comment]Unpopular opinion "whistleblowers" are a vital part of any organization for immoral and illegal acts whether it helps your party or not it is important to have them root out issues even if it the allegations weren't correct in the end.
[comment]Regardless of  what one's opinion on Trump behaviour or the Democrats behaviour,  protecting a whistleblower identity is fundamental and essential for the very mechanism of Whistleblowers to exist. And the very existence of the whistleblower mechanism  is an important contribution to democracy.  If we go down on whistleblower like this and rip them in the public place, then the message we are sending to other potential future whistleblower is that they better shut up and not say anything otherwise they are risking their lives.  This is what happens in Dictatorships.

[comment]That's not him.. this is embarrassing.. take this down.
[comment]Talk about a pile of insufferable lefties.
[comment]TF.
[comment]The hatred on their faces is amazing. They all hate Trump. Too bad crooked Hillary lost, thank god.
[comment]I went to elementary school with him, he was really smart, like Einstein smart
[comment]Epstein didn’t kill himself! 😂😂😂😂
[comment]How do we know he is the whistle blower?
[comment]The whistleblowers name hasnt been released. That's the nice thing about the whistleblower, you can claim anyone is him and they wont deny it.
[comment]Isn’t that the lady from planet of the apes?
[comment]Look at all those Socialists..
[comment]Boy has This shitshow been brigaded
[comment]😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[comment]Lol they look so salty
[comment]I'm hoping that turns out to be who it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I read the transcript, looked to me like that ass-hole ambassador to Ukraine was trying to entrap people into saying there was a quid-pro-quo. According to the transcript, he had to be told several times that wasn't the case, though he seemed to be pushing to do that. He was on the call in question, so could easily be the problem.
[comment]They sure look like a happy bunch there.  So much smiling!
[comment]This is completely inaccurate- "This picture was not taken on Thursday, but rather a day earlier as Obama spoke in a live televised address after Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton conceded to Trump." Per [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4566547/white-house-obama-staffers-donald-trump/%3famp=true).
[comment]Truly pathetic... the face of children when they don’t get their way. 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]I feel so bad for Donald Trump. He is an amazing leader and never gets the respect he deserves. It’s so sad. I’m so proud with how calm and contained he has been throughout his whole presidency and especially now during this global crisis. Thank you for being our leader!
[selftext]https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/fqu8ez/i_feel_so_bad_for_donald_trump_he_is_an_amazing/[comment]🍻 🇺🇸
[comment]I don't feel that bad. He loves the heat. He doesnt love the crisis itself, but he thrives on media backlash.
[comment]He's an idiot and a lunatic
[comment]He’s got a ton of supporters by his side too, he understands the fake news haters are not reality. I think it actually gives him energy lol
[comment]Apparently, staying calm and telling people things will get better is wrong.
[comment][Orange man bad &gt;:(](https://babylonbee.com/img/articles/article-3314-1.jpg)
[comment]But he's profiting off of government, though he's the only government servant to lose money while in office.
[comment]I'm surprised the Bernie Babies are still crying about him even though they're gonna be receiving a check for not working like they wanted.
[comment]Probably going to get downvoted for this but here goes.

I'm not a huge fan of trump and especially his mouth, but I would be lying if I said he wasn't an accomplished president. His foreign policy has been a mixed bag and domestically has been quite good. He definitely doesn't get the recognition he deserves and DEFINITELY doesn't deserve the amount of hate he gets from the left and the msm. Anytime he does a good thing the left just can't let him have it and come together to celebrate, instead they have to become pro terrorist and root for the collapse of the economy because orange man bad
[comment]Did he just say he would comply with investigation into how he spend 500 billion despite signing the law?
[comment]Perfect summary of my sentiments.
[comment]Agreed!
[comment]The way you talk about Trump is kind of creepy in a cultish way
[comment]I honestly believe hate and drama fuel his ego. 
And I do like Trump as a leader - he's decisive, has the balls to say what he thinks, and really puts America first. 
But I'm not going to deny there's a lot of narcissism on his part. But hey, if we all get a bigger piece of the pie, it's good by me. 
Most people that hate Trump hate him because of his abrasive personality, with little knowledge of what he's actually done for the economy. 
And even when he does something good, they still hate on him because these people are really deranged. You really can't argue with these people.
[comment]Yep
[comment]I do think he’s a great leader, but coming down to real morals and values, he isn’t that great.

I’m still supporting him more than Bernie thi
[comment]I’ve been coming to this sub for months. Have never commented. Trying to figure out how anyone can support this criminal. 

After months there’s only one thing I need to ask. Then I will unjoin.

What the hell are you people smoking or drinking. I want some. Haven’t hallucinated since the 70’s.
[comment]This post title is so fucking creepy to me. The cult of personality that surrounds Trump is fucking weird. 

Objectively he hasn't been calm and contained this presidency. He lashes out like...a lot.
[comment]I’m not sure why anyone would feel bad for Donald Trump.  The guy’s a billionaire, in arguably the most powerful position on the planet.  A position he fought very hard to get, and a position he wants to occupy again in 2020.  People don’t give him “respect”?  Okay, welcome to politics.

You know who I feel bad for?  My boss’s friend, who will probably lose her small business running a salon due to the pandemic.  I feel bad for the doctors and nurses who died from Coronavirus because they didn’t have the proper PPE.

You know who I don’t feel sorry for? Billionaire politicians who will be fine no matter what happens.  Feeling bad for people like that is like feeling sorry for Hollywood starlets because someone was mean to them on Twitter.  It comes with the territory.
[comment]Oh man, Trump is the absolute worst and anyone that cant see that is coo-coo-ka-ka insano.
[comment]Not just “being our leader”, but “Our Great Leader”.

I say that non-ironically.
[comment]I think he's a great leader. I don't like him as a person though. Seems like a jerk. But solid leader.
[comment]Democrats have gone completely crazy over Trump. Recently in r/politics, some dude said that even if it was Trump vs OJ Simpson, he’d vote against Trump. I said that Trump is not worse than OJ Simpson, and I got downvoted for it! These crazy Democrats gaslit by the media so much that they think that Donald Trump is literally worse than a murderer. Their TDS is so bad that they’d probably vote for Ted Bundy over Trump
[comment]Honestly I don’t know how that man can just wake up everyday and just be able to deal with all that hate he gets from the Media and the Do Nothing Democrats. Just imagine waking up every morning and thinking to yourself “There are MILLIONS of people who would love to have a public hanging of me or worse.” I don’t think some people realize how emotionally tough of a job being president is. Rather you like him or not, you have to admit he has balls of titanium.
[comment]Hes an accused rapist, racist, and sexist. How can you be om with this?
[comment]I voted for him in 2016 hoping he would be at least half as successful as he'd turned out to be. He has surpassed all my expectations. He gets criticized for many things, including his brashness and unpresidential-ness. But many of the critics don’t take into account the fact that all those qualities make him who he is and add to his success. 

I didn’t vote for him to be my pastor, or a teacher, or a husband or a counselor. I voted for him to be a president. He’s the top mo-fo and he’s got the exact right personality to be the top mo-fo at this point in the history of our country. 

Do you think anyone aside from him would have been able to stand up to the left commie machine the way he had? Do you know of anyone who was running against him in the primaries on the right who could have taken the amount of abuse he’s been able to take? And through all of this he’s been kicking ass and taking names.

And nobody has been better at forcing the left to take off their masks and show themselves for the radical commies and swamp monsters they really are. Many democrat voters are waking up and seeing their own party for the swamp it’s become. And nobody but Trump could have pulled it off the way he had.
[comment]Amazing, seriously? Your infection rate is worse than ours.
[comment]This is how Trump "deals" with the virus

January 22: “We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”

February 2: “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.”

February 24: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA… Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”

February 25: “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.”

February 25: “I think that's a problem that’s going to go away… They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine.”

February 26: “The 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.”

February 26: “We're going very substantially down, not up.”

February 27: “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

February 28: “We're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.”

March 2: “You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?”

March 2: “A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly.”

March 4: “If we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — some of them go to work, but they get better.”

March 5: “I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.”

March 5: “The United States… has, as of now, only 129 cases… and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!”

March 6: “I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down… a tremendous job at keeping it down.”

March 6: Anybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They’re there. And the tests are beautiful…. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.”

March 6: “I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it… Every one of these doctors said, ‘How do you know so much about this?’ Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.”

March 6: “I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.”

March 7: “We’ll hold tremendous rallies...I’m not concerned at all.”

March 8: “We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on coronavirus.”

March 9: “This blindsided the world.”

March 10: "Over a million tests have been distributed," Pence said, and "before the end of this week, another 4 million tests will be distributed." (Obviously not a trump quote, but it's to illustrate how ridiculous they've been)

March 10: "Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!"

March 11: "I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!"

March 12: "108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem, some of which we are helping!"

March 13: "To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!"

March 13: "Today I am declaring a national emergency. Two very big words."

March 13. "No, I don't take responsibility at all. Because we were given a set of circumstances, given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we are talking about."

March 13. "We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act ... I have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I'll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about."

March 15: “This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible. But it’s something we have tremendous control over.”

March 16: “We’re going to win. And I think we’re going to win faster than people think — I hope. On a scale from 1-10, I rate my response as a 10.”

March 17: “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. People are dying who never died before.”

March 19: “Governors are suppose to do a lot of this work. We’re not a shipping clerk.”

March 24: : "I do… we are doing very well with almost all the governors… \[but\] it’s a two-way street, they have to treat us well also."

March 24: "The Defense Production Act is in full force, but haven't had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States."

March 24: Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. Been going for a while, but we’ll win. We’ll win.

March 25: “You’re going to have suicides by the thousands” “People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death. Probably and — I mean, definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus.”

March 26: "I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they'll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?"

March 27: As usual with “this” General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.

March 27: General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!! u/GeneralMotors u/Ford

March 27: Mike Pence. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I’m a different type of person — I say, 'Mike, don’t call the governor of Washington. You are wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.' It doesn’t make any difference what happens.

March 27: You call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus. You know, you can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is, but the children do very well.
[comment]Delt a very bad hand from Obama and now Covid19.
[comment]Personally I feel that's he's been less than calm. He often lashes out, he just uses Twitter instead of other avenues that we are used to. And as president everything you do is looked at under a microscope and criticized. As it should be. 

And genuinely curious, what do you get out of that last line of thanking Trump. When people do that I feel like it's the same people that clap at the end of movies
[comment]🤣
[comment]Trump is the worst Republican president we have had since Nixon. He isn’t a leader - he’s a bully. He tries to “will” things to be reality and is self centered and too concerned about his image.

I agree he has been unfairly bashed by the media and the demo-rats witch hunts have been wrong.

He isn’t anywhere near the leader Reagan or the Bushes were.
[comment]He's an "amazing leader" yet he spent the first two months of this crisis calling coronavirus a "democratic hoax" and assuring us everything was perfectly okay and that we should just live our normal lives. Now that shit has completely gone downhill, he's trying to gaslight us and claim that he took it seriously the entire time, and is now calling it the "Chinese virus" in an attempt to make us focus on hating China instead of him. His incompetency has killed thousands of Americans during this pandemic, and it will kill thousands more. He will go down as the worst president in U.S. history.
[comment]I don’t know. This is his Churchill moment and he is blowing it. He should have more address the nation speeches where he gives status updates directly to the nation.
[comment]There seems to be an epidemic of assholes that are completely misguided by the media and our liberal higher ed system. Seems like most people are happy to accept what they hear without doing a little research on their own to find the truth. Sure Trump may not be the greatest guy you’d want to hang out with at the backyard BBQ, but he’s done a hell of a job with the economy and standing up to foreign bullies in Europe and beyond. People don’t like his style but it’s working ....
[comment]He's a monster.
[comment]He isn't perfect, no human is. But I think he is doing the best he can. After all, we have never faced something like this before.
[comment]The President's main issue is his mouth. It seems the older he's gotten, the less of a filter he has. That becomes an issue because it takes the focus off of what he's accomplished and onto what he says.
[comment]I disagree. I don't think he's been doing a great job handling. There was a moment of two weeks where he was taking it seriously but words matter. There is countless evidence that he originally claimed to not believe in the severity and has now as recently as yesterday blamed hospitals for hoarding. 

The amount of mixed information isn't good for maintaining unity with the public and my concern is that he holding his rallies via the the press briefings. Some said that "actions speak louder than words". Sure, but words still matter, a lot, and he hasn't been consistent throughout any of this. 

Sure the economy is tanking but there are thousands to millions more people or tanking even harder. It feels like he never seems to get that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]FACT CHECK: No, Trump Did Not Tell People To ‘Inject Themselves With Disinfectant’ Or ‘Drink Bleach’
[selftext]https://www.dailywire.com/news/fact-check-no-trump-did-not-tell-people-to-inject-themselves-with-disinfectant-or-drink-bleach?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=benshapiro[comment]I love this sort of story when it goes viral like this.  Today Trump even doubled down on it, ensuring the media will lose their minds over what's essentially a non-story.  

Is this a policy issue?  Nope.  Do Republicans and Conservatives care about this sort of trivia?  Nope.  

But the liberal media will run wild with this, distracting all the Democrats from building a policy based platform that will bring voters out.  Instead all they have is an empty bag that says 'vote against trump' and win everything in this bag.
[comment]Once again President Trump demonstrates how easy it is to distract a stupid chicken with a bug.  (Rural experience req'd. for full understanding)
[comment]UV light is used every day at our hospital to sanitize our N-95 masks. Trump is always right.
[comment]Liberalism is a sickness
[comment]I just got banned on r/facepalm for stating that same fact.  I’m so glad to be a subscriber here!!
[comment]Trump trolls the press again.
[comment]He clarified he was being sarcastic. Most people don’t get his sense of humor. He likes to work the fake news into a frenzy by suggesting idiotic proposals, like injecting a human with disinfectant, that no rational person would believe or actually do.
[comment]Does this really need to be said?
[comment]https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122858/
[comment]But But But CNN deciphered Trump speak for me and they said we have to drink bleach because it cure the cancer.
[comment]CNN stated that trump the whole world in order to prevent Rona, to take bleach capsules analy. Heard it on CNN so it must be true.
[comment]Even if he did and they believed him. Let them go. It’s for the best.
[comment]Crazy how many people are repeating that!

And I'll say "please provide the quote where he says that".

And they say, "well, he didn't say THAT, but..."

Here's what he said:

&gt;"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me."

He doesn't suggest injecting bleach.

He ends with "let's talk to doctors".

Ugh.
[comment]OMG OK I WAS GONNA POST THIS HERE! But thank you!. My facebook post has been bombarded with fake news from people who more than likely heard it through word of mouth. So I had to watch the actual speech and never did he ever suggest that people inject themselves with lysol but that “they” the medical professional were looking into a type of disinfectant that could be injected to clear the virus. If people would do their own research and actually watch the announcement they would see that. Unless they have TDS! DJT2020!
[comment]I understand that he was referring to how the UV light is used as the disinfectant.

The reason for the craziness around his statement is how he stated them. He talked about the UV light and his fascination with it. Then paused as if he was going to start his briefing. 

Then he started in about the disinfectant. If he didn't pause or made a connection between the two it is easily understandable that his wording makes it seem like he was suggesting disinfectant products versus the disinfectant delivered by the UV light.
[comment]The lefts blind hatred for Trump is showing. Although it won't matter because He'll be president until 2024 so ( ︶︿︶)_╭∩╮them.
[comment]CNN has not told the truth in many years...they have their own warped opinions and assume everything.....but no truth
[comment]I’ve posted on a number of subreddits and as you can guess got severely downvoted but I don’t care. 

The only thing he said wrong is “inject”. The correct word would be “ingest” , but slips happen. 

Ironically my medical partner sent me a link today unrelated to Trump asking if we should follow a new guideline. He sent a link related to betadine use in the nose, as large scale nasal/throat irrigation, and gargles.  It’s a freaking disinfectant we place on the skin to sterilize it befor surgery.  There’s a number of scientific articles on it, but here’s actually a NY times articles on using it for gargles and it’s effect on reducing viral load: [betadine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/well/live/gargle-gargling-coronavirus-infections-bacteria-virus.html) 

He never F’ing said to drink bleach or Lysol.  The liberal reddit mental gymnastics is mind boggling at times.
[comment]The people that had been telling others to drink bleach and wants to themselves is offended because a guy allegedly said to drink bleach when in reality he didn’t

🤔
[comment]Now time to lather myself in leftist tears
[comment]You know, I’ve never much liked trump, and I think he says a lot of stupid things and isn’t always articulate. But come on. He’s so obviously not telling people to drink bleach. He’s talking about different, emerging science that might have promising results. He just doesn’t bring it up in the best way.
[comment]It's a good thing he clarified because Democrats don't understand 4D chess. If he didn't clarify you'd have all the Democrats trying to drink hand sanitizer.
[comment]This post deserves a silver. You’re welcome
[comment]Trump is the master troll. I’m glad he could hit them one more time through this lie fest of theirs.
[comment]But he did say this, right? 

&gt; And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning?<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/r8odab059m141.jpg[comment]Ah yes, the "I know you are but what am I" defense, with a touch of the "everybody's corrupt, so what's the big deal?" qualifier. Hope that works out for you.
[comment]It’s important to attribute these flaws to both parties. Despite one’s political leaning, one is just as likely to make mistakes. It’s important to remember that all sides are human. Does Obama have his flaws? Completely, he hid imperialism under the banner of liberal policy. Is Trump flawed? Yes, wealth inequality has risen to a tremendous degree.
[comment]At this point it’s just become a blame game. Both sides have faults. Both sides have crooks. Both sides are far from perfect. Politics have changed and nowadays it’s more important to put blame and call out opponents rather than focus on making America a better place to live. If Democrats and Republicans put their heads together in a civilized manner with no cameras and no reality TV bullshit we would progress much further as a society.
[comment]Yeah, I know, right? Trump has NEVER done anything wrong. Right? 

Look, I'm a republican, but I still have my opinions.  Trump's an idiot.
[comment]Blagojevich was impeached and imprisoned by a Democrat-led legislature in Illinois. Just wanted to put that out there.

I also don't see why we shouldn't hold Trump accountable for things we criticize the Democrats on. Running up the deficit, treating women inappropriately, warmongering, restricting gun ownership, profiting from his office, appointing family and friends in political offices as favors, golfing instead of working, the list goes on. If we complained about Obama and Biden doing it wr have to complain about Trump doing it.

Judge not, lest ye be judged.
[comment]I am extremely disappointed with how “creepy and sexist” Joe Biden is. He’s as creepy and sexist as the most well behaved grandfather at thanksgiving dinner.
[comment]Weird sex? Oral sex is not weird.
[comment]Both sides, eh?
[comment]Honestly during the last election, I sat on my absentee ballot for like a week because I didn’t want to vote for Trump but I didn’t want Hillary to win. Since then, I’ve actually grown to like Trump. Mostly because the Left absolutely hates him and I think it’s comical the way they’ve used every avenue to try and get rid of him, but nothing works. Anyway, in keeping with the theme of the original post, the Dems have no leg to stand on with their holier than thou bullshit. I feel like the blame game, disinformation campaigns, and political entrenchment of both sides are only going to get worse.
[comment]Bluntly, it's a 4th Amendment issue; if the democrats are not prosecuted for similar or worse crimes, then it is not right to go after trump.

Equal application of the law; it must apply to everyone equally. The fact that democrats are exempt from it remains a serious problem.
[comment]I will post this to /politics 

Come at me bro.
[comment]This comment on r/ShitPoliticsSays sums up pretty well whatever the left is doing, courtesy of u/Euphemism:


&gt;I've noticed that a lot on the left. You can always count on the following happen after the first action.

1st - Someone, likely a conservative, gets elected.

2nd - The left freaks out. They get organized. The unions get involved. They start to protest, create a scene, impede peoples movement, just generally cause chaos.

3rd - They dig up dirt on the person, their family, and associates for anything even tangentially "problematic". If they can't find anything, then that absence of bad stuff just means they are just hiding it, and then will harass said person, family or associates to get them to lash out at the harassment and use that lashing out as the "problematic" item.

4th - Then their talking heads will give interviews on all the TV, radio and newspapers(That will freely give them air time, and not question or mention any of the above items) to explain how we can not have someone that causes such division and violence and chaos in our community...

It always seems to follow the same pattern, regardless of the city, state or country.

[comment]r/T_D is leaking; President Trump mocked a disabled reporter and then defended the use of the hand gesture and the “hurrr I don’t recall” by saying he wasn’t mocking his physical disability he was just calling the guy a mental retard which is worse than mocking a physical disability. He’s a disgrace as President and the fact that democrats won’t hold their own accountable doesn’t change that.
[comment]Doesn't change that Trump IS inappropriate, just shows the hypocrisy of what each party is willing to overlook when it comes to their own. A similar list could be made of Republicans, hell, Trump and Roy Moore could be a full list alone.
[comment]Just because other politicians committed crimes it doesn't make Trump less currupt. May they all get punishments proportional to their own crimes. Whataboutism is deflection.

- cheated on his wife of 20+ years with his brother's widow

- cheated on his brother's widow with some rando half his age and fathered an illegitimate child, which he denied until recently proven

- cheated on his dead brother's widow with a woman much younger....at least he married her.

Such a great man!
[comment]Socialism is more than just health care. I take it you’re from the US? I feel like a lot of Americans have been brought up to believe it’s a dirty word like communism. Ironically, the US already enjoys a ton of socialist programs and benefits.

But on health care - I grew up in Australia, a socialist democracy with a massive economy for its population. Healthcare there is far superior to living in the US as I do now. It’s incomparable. Wait times are longer in America. And you’re enslaved to your work if you get sick. It’s archaic. 

I’m not arguing with you about the capitalist economy being the way to go, although it’s far from perfect.

I don’t want to argue with you, but I appreciate the convivial discourse.

[comment]We as a party cannot excuse Trump’s behavior because Democrats have acted the same way.  We cannot defend his behavior, only his policies.
[comment]I LOVE whataboutisms!
[comment]This logical fallacy is called the "tu quoque" argument, wherein rather than address the claim or the criticisms themselves, the responder addresses criticism with criticism.
A smarter response would be to address and logically justify the claims of the criticisms.

[comment]The most glaring aspect of your message is the dubiousness of redirecting attention from one wrong to another.

Then, if we assume the intention is to defend Trump per se and not his entire administration, it's telling that this message makes no attempt to put him on equal footing with Obama. Instead, the message piles on Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, John Edwards, Rod Blagojevich, and Weiner.

As a side point, it's certainly curious that Trump is mulling a pardon for Blagojevich.

Returning to my initial point, this message implies that you, OP, are OK with Trump violating the Emoluments clauses of the Constitution, violating the Flores agreement, reneging on JCPOA, denying the death toll of Hurrican Maria, endangering national security re security clearance scandal, endangering national security re climate change denial, and backing Putin over the IC re cyberwar.

As for the accusation that Obama gave money to terrorists, the reality is that he unfroze Iranian assets as part of the JCPOA.

And before any simpletons reply, I don't care about the Clintons. If Bill did terrible things with Epstein, he should rot in jail. I don't care. 

Furthermore, for anyone reading this who only gets their news from one or two sources, I highly encourage you to diversify your diet. Even if you're allergic to reading, MSNBC, CNN, and FOX aren't your only choices. There's PBS , CBS News, Al Jazeera, Democracy Now, your local affiliates,.

What I do care about is that we have a president that works for America; we don't have that now.

[comment]Truly curious as to how bad behavior on one side equates to bad behavior on the other.  I know this is a nation with only 2 prominent parties, but why should any of us be ok with allowing any immoral people to be given a pass because"the other side" has failures as well.  Surely we should be able to see that all of the miscreants should be held to task.  Deflecting blame because someone else sucks is a child's strategy.  Any adult worth their weight should see it for what it's worth, and assign blame/punishment accordingly.  If this passing the buck becomes the new normal, then we are doomed to Idiocracy.
[comment]My two cents here would be that it took a list of 8 individuals to draw comparison to a single individual.  I believe that there's enough information for a reasonable individual to find Trump guilty of several indecent (if not entirely illegal) acts. I would not expect or stand for anyone from the other side of the aisle to be treated differently.
[comment]That doesn't exactly make Trump not inappropriate. I lean right and I get that he's a moron...
[comment]8 people, we know Trump by himself has exceeded Biden And matched Edwards. He is a horrible human being. the fact we seem to forgive all sins committed by him is disgusting.   


in addition, Obama and Clinton’s entries require either accepting things that we know are proven false, or stretching facts pretty far.  This one image is a great example of where we have went wrong.
[comment]Quid pro quo is what joe Biden actually did with Ukraine. It was the Clinton foundation who collided in the 2016 election. It’s the democrats who aren’t following the constitution by following a proper impeachment procedures. They just don’t like trump so want him gone. Get over it you lost
[comment]It’s funny that you think any democrats legitimately support Biden.

[comment]If you want to know who is in the pocket of the Chinese Communist Party just listen to who is using Chinese Communist Party talking points verbatim to attack the President of the United States and the American citizens.

When Stalin was purging and starving his citizens the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Hitler was coming to power, the Western media denied it and covered it up. When the Holodomor was happening the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Mao was murdering his own people starving them to death and executing them the Western media denied it and covered it up. When Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were executing people, shooting 9-year-old girls in the head and starving people to death the Western media denied it and covered it up.  When the communist where attacking Korea the Westen media denied it and covered it up. When the North Vietnamese began attacking the South the Western media denied it and covered it up.  When Pol Pot emptied the cities and slaughtered the population in Cambodia creating the killing fields the Western media denied it and covered it up. When White farmers were being slaughtered in Zimbabwe the Western media denied it and covered it up. When the South African farmers are being slaughtered the Western media deny it and cover it up and persuade nations to deny White South African refugee status. 

Do you see the pattern here?

And today when looking at History looking back at events the Western media rewrites the truth and manufacturing fiction to deny reality and cover up the truth. 

The communist movement has been very busy very active (Wikipedia, Socialist media publisher, blue checkmark twits) rewriting history and in the library system having books removed and destroyed. In the publishing and distribution industry having books removed from stores and band from online sales going as far as having Visa, Square, and Master card deny service and PayPal shut down accounts.

Wall Street is the modern-day slave boat owners of old.  They have modernized slavery using the Chinese Communist Party as the plantation owner to provide the slave labour for their profits.  Instead of moving the slaves to the factories they simply moved all the factories out of Western Democracies to Communist China, to the slaves.

socalist media publisher run by communists staffed by cultists funded by the oil kingdoms all for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party and Soros Open Society Foundation's Open Border project.
[comment]Yes, this is a good point, but to be fair, the president _should_ have access to privileged information that the media does not.
[comment]It would be nice to actually see the dates of these articles.  I think we were all downplaying the virus up until about a month ago, me included obviously.  The problem with Trump is that his understanding of how serious this virus could be was very delayed.  And when he finally decided to accept the reality of the situation, it was a little too late.

[selftext]https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/andrew-yang-tech-entrepreneur-fears-automation-self-driving-cars/[comment]Does anyone else think the recent surge in left leaning media regarding Yang reeks of fear?
[comment]Going back to the cotton gin, automation has proven to be a net plus for creating jobs. While the nature of the economy and employment may change, ultimately new jobs will be created. Apparently, Yang thinks that we are too stupid and/or lazy to adapt. I wholly reject that notion.
[comment]He wants everyone to be a machine of the government. Just like Gabbard, and slightly different take on communism in the hopes that the dummys in the middle will vote fo them and take away Trumps lead.
[comment]I like how the article points to self driving vehicles putting truckers out of work. Airplanes have been able to fly themselves for the past decade, from take off to landing, but that hasn’t put pilots out of work. You will always need a human for the foreseeable future behind the wheel. During inclement weather the sensors on these vehicles stop working and a humans needs to take over. There is a plethora of other situations that robots can’t navigate through and needs a human on standby.
[comment]Make America Math Again
[comment]Not a fan of UBI, not at all.
But if it would serve as a replacement of other welfare programs, I’m all for that. You don’t need the same bloated bureaucy for it, for one. 

Milton Friedman talked about a negative income tax, it’s similar to that.
[comment]Yang's proposals fall apart without basically re-writing the constitution.

He was asked in a youtube video about how UBI would effect rental prices in places with already high rent.

His response was that with UBI people will move to rural, low cost of living places (what!?) and that he would change zoning requirements nationwide to make housing more dense.

You can't change zoning at the national level, and even if you could can you imagine the boondoggle if someone in Alabama is trying to decide how NYC should manage their land/development?

His plans make no real economic or practical sense once you go beyond a real base level.
[comment]Isn’t that called welfare and food stamps?
[comment]Yang has literally devoted his career to solving problems that affect ordinary Americans and he’s continuing to do so in an even bigger way as a candidate for president. That’s not the profile of a so-called snake oil salesman.
[comment]&gt; "[Yang] predicts that in a few years, 'we’re going to have a million truck drivers out of work,' and 'all hell breaks loose.'"

This is one of those progressive talking points which carries with it a planetarily sized load of irony. Democrats and many of the President's critics frequently denigrate him by telling us he's a fear-monger and that's how he gets by.

...yet almost the entirety of the Democrats' economic platform is anchored to the idea that society is operating under the looming threat of an unprecedented destruction of jobs. To quote Jeff Bezos: "...we are so unimaginative about what future jobs are going to look like and what they are going to be."

And just like how Henry Ford quipped that if he had asked what someone would've wanted to get around more quickly, they'd have said a faster horse, we are in yet another revolution. We've had several of these, but despite constant population growth, our country has always done well in employing our citizens. For Yang to assume that we're approaching a barrier in our economy's ability to generate employment, and hold to his claim so vehemently that he's leveraging it in attempt to implement reckless economic policies, is nothing short of a total desecration to the idea of human progress and creativity. 

In the dawn of internet-based journalism, if journalists in charge of their printing presses had the idea of a universal basic income, they would almost certainly have lobbied for a UBI system as well. Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press had no way of comprehending that you and I would ever be able to communicate from nearly anywhere in the world, with near-instantaneous delivery. He also wouldn't have ever known that one could be paid wirelessly for doing so. The destruction of the newspaper industry fostered the growth of an even more broad, even more democratic digital media sphere where anyone can report news and the industry as a whole is using far more diverse models; sometimes purely ad-funded, sometimes purely subscription-based. It varies, but there's a larger opportunity for people to become journalists than there ever was before.

There've been times throughout history where scientists, economists, and politicians have made predictions about development curves in their particular fields. They have all been routinely proven wrong. Arguably, the only wise move is to refrain from making any predictions, because human development has had a way of bringing consistent, aggregated improvement despite the astronomic population growth we've seen in the past century. 

Democrats like Yang are taking the position that long-term employment is under threat, but as I said above, that is a desecration to human progress. At best, it's an indulgence of laziness and display of Yang's own lack of imagination. At worst, it's a blatant political tactic to literally buy voters by threatening to change America's laws to help politicians, like himself, force those who create, work, and contribute, to pay the bills of those who do little or none of those things.
[comment]Man, I used to be a fan of National Review a decade back, but this is such a shit piece. Yang is proposing to make contingency plans for those whose jobs will be replaced by automation, which is inevitably coming and he supports. This is the furthest thing from him being "afraid of automation" and advocating against it.
[comment]Vegas has Yang at 12-1, basically considering him in third place now.
[comment]Do you get more money living in California because the gas is so high
[comment]No, we don't need more automaton.
[comment]I don’t know what is surprising about any of this. Democrats know people want free shit, so they pander for a cheap vote. They know the majority of Democratic voters aren’t intelligent enough, or simply don’t care, to question how it’s afforded. Most believe the government can “just print the money” because you know, inflation is not a thing. Plus the Democrats love having people dependent on the government. Same old song and dance. This is why you need your guns people. That way at least the government has to make a few considerations before they attempt to just come and take your shit so they can pay for this type of stuff
[comment]I only support UBI if it's a *replacement* of our horribly inept and corrupt welfare system, not in addition to it.

IMO UBI is more transparent than the cobbled together joke we have right now concerning welfare.

[comment]I like UBI as a replacement, and while Andrew Yang keeps getting bullied to adding more and more welfare systems on top of UBI rather than replacing i'm counting on conservatives to let it pass only if those concessions be made which will likely be the case, especially if he gets the nomination and starts changing his message to more moderate.
[comment]I love how r/republican is so astroturfed that the upvoted comments *support* Yang and UBI, which is so obviously far from conservative beliefs i.e. $3 trillion per year in seized and redistributed wealth, except now not even to people that need it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]President Trump promised a fast vaccine; this is the fastest vaccine creation in human history. Human trials begin today.
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/mdudxpmkq4n41.jpg[comment]Hoping this vaccine works. My country will be hit hard by the virus. Good work Mr Trump
[comment]*You know, probably, this is the fastest and best vaccine ever developed in human history. I’ve seen all of human history and this is it. It’s yuge. They said probably it couldn’t be done. But here we are doing it and winning.* Try to read it in Trump’s voice! Ha
[comment]Hell frickin yeah
[comment]I hope it works,but he'll never get the credit he deserves that's for sure
[comment]If the vaccine works, I can’t wait to see how the insane lefties try to spin it as a bad thing to make Trump look bad.
[comment]how true is this? I can't seem to find this anywhere?

I know Germany started testing for a vaccine
[comment]I always thought vaccines took 5 or even 10+ years to develope. I'd be surprised if this one works
[comment]A: Do you really think Trump ordering a vaccine be made is the sole reason why it happened?
B: This is in Seattle, not Huntsville. They don’t need Trump to tell them what to do.
[comment]When they told me about the vaccine trials today
NPR reminded me that it’s not the same as other vaccines and it’s still a long way off before we can all have them and the president was wrong.
[comment]Is there an article? This is just a screenshot.
[comment]Thats so awesome! I can't wait for this to be over! I'm a wedding videographer and I had 3 clients calling me telling me their wedding's are cancelled. And the thing is I don't feel right keeping their whole deposit even thou this is my main source of income. This year sucks for business people.
[comment]First Clinical trial = vaccine??? Vaccines AT LEAST a year away and that would be absolutely crazy fast. Also Trump owns moderna???
[comment]I sincerely hope a fast and successful safe vaccine is available. I’m old enough to remember the swine flu of 1976, and what happened then.  If you don’t know about the mass push to vaccinate all Americans, take some time to read up.
[comment]Honest question. If a company in Massachusetts developed this, what does it have to do with Trump?
[comment]Isn't vaccination a libtard Democrat scheme to make white Christians' children autistic?
[comment]That seems odd.

Trump recently tried to buy the german company CureVac because they are working on an antidote. Trump was planning to use this antidote exclusively for Amierica.  
But the company told him to go fck himself
[comment]Ride Trump a little harder
[comment]Get to fuck, trump is a literal moron
[comment]I hope USA finds the vaccine first. That should put eurofags and democrats to their place.
[comment]Fingers crossed it works.
[comment]Will be quick but expect 12 months before we see a vaccine. Clinical trials take years
[comment]Wait, why are we developing vaccines for a "liberal hoax"? /s :P
[comment]He’s doing a phenomenal job with this.
[comment]its just a phase 1 trial. No real efficacy data is expected from this study.

Its basically a test on healthy ppl to see if this vaccine is safe , what kind of toxicities will it induce, and see if ppl don't immediately die from complications. 

TBH, significance of this is overblown. Majority of test drugs go into phase 1s and never make it out to warrant further investigation. 


When they start large phase 3 trials, then we should be talking
[comment]The vaccine won't be ready until people are looked at one year in the future at least because they may have unknown side effects. Hopefully they get it right and these people trying it become immune.<|endoftext|>

[comment]1. It's not the President's money either.
2. My congressman are voting for it so it's really like 538 people sending money out.
3. I'll end up paying for it in the end anyway.

Dumb meme is dumb.
[comment]As hypocritical as that is, it’s just as hypocritical for conservatives to accept and approve of handouts. True conservatives should be objecting to this and all these massive spending bills just like they would if it was a dem dolling them out.
[comment]Dear Trump Supporters: Don't be accepting that money that he sends out...remember Socialism is Evil.
[comment]Everyone against socialism should also reject this money.
[comment]Might have to buy a nice rifle with that money
[comment]I’ve seen so many comments here with diverging view points that I don’t even know what to say myself.
[comment]I’m actually not okay with federal aid. I get the dire circumstances but I was raised to earn what you get. If I get a check, it’ll probably just end up in my savings for a rainy day.
[comment]Hey Trump lover. Don't accept the money he sends out.. Remember. It is socialist to spread the money arround and you havn't worked for it. /s  


Seriously though. Why are you americans always looking from one side at things and trying to figth eachother. Maybe remember you are not each others enemy...
[comment]Every check should come with a "Trump 2020" sticker.
[comment]There are no republicans in this thread any way.
[comment]And here I thought a giant pandemic that affects and treats everyone the same, regardless of partisan affiliation, might just bring some unity and compel us to see in our neighbors the people that they are and not the partisans they identify themselves as. Common enemy and such ...

How dumb of me ...
[comment]This is immature, childish, wins nobody to anyone side, and pisses people off. 

There are real worries about devaluing the dollar. 

There are serious problems with the way our nation is setup, and the ideology it is based on. We only are running with half of Keynesian economics. If we took the whole package...
[comment]It's not his money either, it's the taxpayers. Hopefully this will be over sooner rather than later then Trump and his cohorts can get back to trying to dismantle Obamacare.
[comment]He made us all suffer why wouldn’t I get paid for it?
[comment]Its socialist to give out money! I don’t expect any GOP to accepr
[comment]Better than Bernie’s ‘free stuff’ that we’d still be paying for with 90% of our income for the rest of our lives.
[comment]Why are we handing out money for no reason again?
[comment]Yea get over it, not time to play politics
[comment]This really almost has 1k upvotes. Conservatives really are pathetic
[comment]To be fair, taking this handout would seem very similar to Socialism and that would be against everything we fight for.
[comment]Not my prez, but its my money
[comment]Gonna buy a fat sack with my money
[comment]A socialist president would hand out money to Republicans, you wouldn't do the same in reverse? Or are you actually wishing laws had a loyalty check in them? This seems irresponsibly divisive
[comment]#still their tax dollars
[comment]Why, it's just another attempt at stealing an election. Besides, it's my tax dollars that I have paid to a corrupt government for 50 years, good to get some back. And if you think any of these politicians, regardless of alignment give a rats ass about you. Sorry you're wrong. By the way, he is our president, unfortunately!
[comment]It’s socialist anyways, so Republicans shouldn’t see a cent of it.
[comment]Oh gee i didnt know it was "Trumps money". You people are fuckin brain dead.
[comment]I don't understand this post. Are you suggesting we pick and choose the government programs we participate in based on our political ideology? In which case, I'll direct where I'd like my taxes to go.

Also, I won't be receiving any federal aid because I don't qualify. Instead my tax contribution will provide aid to those who need it.
[comment]Is it President Trump's personal money being sent out, or tax money that comes from all Americans, Democrat, Republican and Independent. Was the legislation bipartisan or not? This specific Reddit does not show the best face of the Republican Party

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm about to get sick

From watchin' my TV

Been checkin' out the news

Until my eyeballs fail to see

I mean to say that every day

Is just another rotten mess

And when it's gonna change, my friends

Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot...

I seen the cops out on the street

Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff

And chokin' in the heat

Listened to reports

About the whisky passin' 'round

Seen the smoke &amp; fire

And the market burnin' down

Watched while everybody

On his street would take a turn

To stomp and smash and bash and crash

And slash and bust and burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Well you can cool it,

You can heat it...

'Cause, baby, I don't need it...

Take your TV tube and eat it

'N all that phony stuff on sports

'N all the unconfirmed reports

You know I watched that rotten box

Until my head began to hurt

From checkin' out the way

The newsmen say they get the dirt

Before the guys on channel so-and-so

And further they assert

That any show they'll interrupt

To bring you news if it comes up

They say that if the place blows up

They'll be the first to tell

Because the boys they got downtown

Are workin' hard and doin' swell,

And if anybody gets the news

Before it hits the street,

They say that no one blabs it faster

Their coverage can't be beat

And if another woman driver

Gets machine-gunned from her seat

They'll send some joker with a brownie

And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Hey you know something people

I'm not black

But there's a whole lots a times

I wish I could say I'm not white

Well, I seen the fires burnin'

And the local people turnin'

On the merchants and the shops

Who used to sell their brooms and mops

And every other household item

Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em

And they say it served 'em right

Because a few of them are white,

And it's the same across the nation

Black &amp; white discrimination

They're yellin' "; You can't understand me!";

And all the other crap they hand me

In the papers and TV

'N all that mass stupidity

That seems to grow more every day

Each time you hear some nitwit say

He wants to go and do you in

Because the color of your skin

Just don't appeal to him

(No matter if it's black or white)

Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we gotta sit around at home

And watch this thing begin

But I bet there won't be many left

To see it really end

'Cause the fire in the street

Ain't like the fire in my heart

And in the eyes of all these people

Don't you know that this could start

On any street in any town

In any state if any clown

Decides that now's the time to fight

For some ideal he thinks is right

And if a million more agree

There ain't no great society

As it applies to you and me

Our country isn't free

And the law refuses to see

If all that you can ever be

Is just a lousy janitor

Unless your uncle owns a store

You know that five in every four

Just one amount and nothin' more

Don't watch the rats go across the floor

And make up songs about being poor

Blow you harmonica son!
[comment]No. Please.  Stop.
[comment]Something people need to be aware of is that rioters don't care about Floyd or any other victim of police brutality.  They don't care about race or injustices or inequality.  They are violent criminals who just look for an excuse to vandalize and do violence.  Rioters simply want to riot, and they'll do so if you give them even the most ludicrous of reasons.  

Do no let these idiots ever convince you that they give a damn about human life, dignity, liberty, freedoms, or justice.  These are the barbarians.
[comment]CNN wanted a riot and pushed for a riot only thing is CNN wanted somebody else to be targeted.
[comment]What would make them target CNN? They seek "truth" from them. Did they side with the former officer or something?

[comment]These Democrat animals they dont care about justice they just want to riot and destroy things
[comment]They have started here in Richmond, VA too smh
[comment]It amuses me all the people posting about how peaceful protest haven't changed anything. Which is why they're rioting now.

has violent riots ever change the hearts of people so they don't hate anymore?

the only thing that will stop racism is time and people changing. 

And the only thing that'll change police involved shootings. Is less crime so the police don't feel the need to reach for their guns so fast.

No shame
[comment] This was a staged event to **put the idea of cannibalism into the minds of the people**. What is more shocking than the idea of cannibalism, **but the act of doing this to an innocent baby**? With one fell swoop, **both** extremes have now been put into the minds of the American populace. While obviously many are horrified, the idea is now however **firmly entrenched** in their psyche's as a future possibility. This is all part of the recent push by these freaks to normalize cannibalism.

1. promote ignorance of COVID contagiousness thus increasing the amount infected

2. MSM flip rhetoric with hyper fear over disease

3. state POTUS was wrong not MSM for lack of immediate and complete solution to problem

4. instill division through race relations by connecting disease to racism 

5. make POC so scared they dont seek treatment thus adding to death toll

6. added death toll supports claim that the POTUS is racist

if it wasnt so stupid it would be brilliant, tinfoil hats around boys
[comment]Smooth brain takes are nothing new for AOC but I don’t see how even if that is true, how is it Trumps fault if people are too scared to go to the hospital. I mean if she is talking about illegal aliens then she shouldn’t call them New Yorkers because they’re not

[comment]Why is people still listening to her after her failed new green deal
[comment]I an sorry but is this a place for honest thoughtful discussion of our party and our values or is this just a place for parroting the nonsense that makes us forget the value of critical thinking? I for one do not equate Trumpism with Republican values or conservatism and I think maybe we’d be better off running somebody other than him. If being personally responsible for our own actions and keeping the money we earn is going to continue to be relevant, I think we should act accordingly, and let our actions reflect our values. 

We can do far better than Trump and we are really in a pickle. I dont think anyone takes Biden seriously, but its looking more and more like Trump knows how to win but not how to govern. And Biden nay hire folks smart enough to see past Trumps BS. Trump thinks he is doing a great job. If we limit him to a one term Presidency then we can show America we care for everyone, and Biden wont stand a chance. If Trump loses and things get suddenly better, who do you think will get the blame? It wont be the Democrats.

[selftext]https://babylonbee.com/news/in-genius-move-trump-supports-impeachment-forcing-democrats-to-oppose-it[comment]So crazy it just might work
[comment]Actually impeachment is the best thing at this point and could lead to a landslide.  The Democrats have had their fun with this little dog and pony show to get cute snippets, but their impeachment vote will be a nightmare.  It will pass, but be close on purely partisan lines which has never happened and  looks very bad.  

Then it goes to the Senate, where suddenly Reps control the timeline, rules and other shenanigans.  They can subpoena Schiff and others.  They can do it all during peak Dem primary days. They can drag it on and include the upcoming IG and Dunham reports, which will be a very bad look for Dems. And still ultimately vote against it. 

Pelosi was smart, this was why she never wanted it. She’s cornered by some young, idealistic but very stupid progressives. .
[comment]Honestly “impeached by democrats” would be a killer campaign slogan for Trump.
[comment]You know that Babylonbee is a satire site, not unlike The Onion.
[comment]Uh babylonbee?
[comment]"Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term."

If that isn't the funniest shit Nancy has every said in regards to Trumps presidential term then i don't know what it. LMAO. I don't think any democrat knew how to respond to that. It won't pass in the senate however. They would need all democratic, both independent and 20 republican senate votes to pass the articles of impeachment at the senate level.
[comment]I'm not a fan of what he said during the call, but I'm also not naive enough to think that politics is not completely quid pro quo.  Dems were obsessed with finding something wrong with the 2016 election, you would think they would be happy Trump wanted to see of there was anything to those conspiracy rumors.  Ukraine wanted a WH visit and to purchase more missiles.  My problem with the call is that Trump specifically asked about Biden. If he had spoken about the stalled Barisma investigation as just that, no issue here. But he shot himself in the foot by talking about Biden. That being said, there was nothing illegal with the call, and I bet if we declassified the phone calls of every other POTUS we'd see this same kind of crap on almost every one. "Oh you want this? Cool, then do this for us and it's good." And before I get jumped on, I get that Dems look at this as a "but Trump wanted something for personal gain because Joe is is political rival". Ok, half of the damn country is Trump's political rival, and Joe may be the front runner in some polls, but guess what? Hillary had a 90% chance of winning. I don't like nepotism, especially when it looks so bad. Did Joe and his son do anything illegal? Not that I can see, but if Barisma did use Hunter's name to get WH access, that should be looked into because I know that if it was a GOP kid, I would want it looked into. It blows my mind that Dems are ok with looking the other way on that.  Look, politics sucks. They're all selfish jerks. Trump's kids who work in the WH do so for free, Trump himself doesn't take a salary. Trump's kids are also educated in business, and are in industries where they have life-long experience.  Sorry for the rant, I'm just tired off all the self-righteous peeps on r/politics who thing the big bad Republicans are just evil incarnate and that we are too red pilled to be anything other than dumb followers.
[comment]The article is from a new satire website... It’s not a real article.
[comment]Sadly, that would probably actually work on them.
[comment]The fact that this article hit the top of r/ republican without folks even noticing it was satire just made my morning.
[comment]Everyone seems to dismiss the fact that Sleepy Joe bragged on National TV about something that appears to have a serious conflict of interest. Trump asked for Ukraine to look into Biden’s claims. Just because he is running for President doesn’t make him immune from investigation, especially when he practically confessed publicly to his actions. 

Creepy Joe has opened a can of worms and Impeachment is a weak attempt to shift the focus off Biden, the DNC, and the fact that Epstein didn’t kill himself.

It appears to have had the opposite effect, Biden and many others will be discredited and then disgraced. I see Biden as the likely sacrifice thrown to the wolves to stop anyone from looking deeper into who was in bed with Barisma...

We shall see
[comment]Tbh, it kind of like there's this kid at one of those win a prize games at a carnival, and he gets very excited about a certain prize. Then, after losing the game, he goes into a small tantrum saying stuff like how he didn't want it anyway, how lame it is and etc.

Out of all the candidates, Tulsi is the only one who makes sense to me. When she speaks I constantly find myself thinking "yes, exactly!" I have a hard time getting behind ANY of the other Democratic candidates because their policies and/or promises just seem unrealistic and some outright looney.

Now to see all the hate being thrown her way, especially from the left, it just boggles my mind and makes me disheartened. 

Long story short, I starting to think Trump will win in 2020.

5.Close down nuclear power plants.
6."Assault weapon" ban.

3.Ending the war on drugs.

[comment]The only democrat worthy of our time to listen to. The rest are bar shit insane.
[comment]Great rhetoric! I love it from either side of the aisle. When there is disagreement, our politicians should focus more on being a committee that seeks to find the best answer to the problem that divides us, rather trying to arbitrarily "win" some argument. This is a prime example!
[comment]People can trying to portray her as the most reasonable Democrat in the room, but as long as she is pushing for huge climate change bills, government-run healthcare, and eliminating the electoral college then she's just as much a nutjob as the rest of them.
[comment]Good for her. If she rolls back a few other things she’s said she’ll easily be my favorite Dem candidate

<|startoftext|>[title]Immigrants Should Not Be on Welfare
[selftext]https://www.heritage.org/welfare/commentary/immigrants-should-not-be-welfare[comment]I agree
[comment]Agreed
[comment] President Trump is being criticized by Democrats for his most recent immigration reform proposal. Under hist new policy proposal, immigrants who receive welfare benefits could be denied green cards or visas. Democrats quickly labeled this policy racist and against American values. Democrats are wrong about this latest piece of the Trump administrations immigration reform efforts. President Trump is right, for most of American history immigrants coming to the United States didn't receive welfare handouts. For almost 150 years immigrants could be denied entry if immigration officials believed they would become a “public charge.” Immigrants had to be economically self-sufficient. Wave after wave of immigrants have achieved the American dream by becoming self-sufficient, even when they came here with nothing. Most economists agree that legal immigration is net contributor to the economy. Now, not all immigrants are beneficial and there are "bad hombres" that immigrate here, but the benefits of legal immigration writ large outweigh these costs to most Americans. This is largely because most legal immigrants are risk takers who come to the United States between the ages of 16 and 40, when they are likely to be at the start of their working years though the peak of their earning years. Skilled immigrants provide the highest benefits, thus President Trump is right when he proposes that we should change our immigration process to favor merit (similar to the policies of Canada and Australia) to ensure that we get the best, brightest, and hardest working immigrants regardless of race, origin, or ethnicity. There should be no welfare benefits for immigrants until they become citizens. Immigrants can become honest, hard working, patriotic American citizens and share in our freedoms, opportunity, and prosperity, but you cannot receive taxpayer welfare benefits. You and your sponsors are responsible for your well being. If an immigrant falls on tough times, then family members, employers, or other sponsors should be held responsible to help them get their feet back on the ground, not the American taxpayers. With entitlement spending massively increasing with trillions of dollars of future deficits in these programs, we cannot afford to allow foreigners to come to America to collect our generous benefits. There is strong [evidence](https://cis.org/Report/Welfare-Use-Legal-and-Illegal-Immigrant-Households) that welfare has the same debilitating dependency effects on ‎immigrants that it has on natural born Americans. Welfare saps them of their [economic drive](https://www.dailysignal.com/2015/08/01/how-welfare-spending-hurts-the-people-its-supposed-to-help/), which is exactly what makes immigrants valuable in the first place. Most immigrants don't abuse our welfare system, and government handouts are not the magnet that attracts them to the United States in the first place. But some immigrants do abuse the system and social service agencies sign them up for welfare handouts. There will be no shortage of ambitious immigrants aspiring to be model American citizens even without welfare. If freedom and opportunity are not enough reason to legally immigrate to the America, then those who would refuse to come under these new conditions probably are not the ones we need anyway.
[comment]And people on welfare should be cleaning trash off our streets, painting and planting trees instead of doing nothing.
[comment]Left this left that...no matter what we do with immigrants you will never be satisfied

Immigrants in America will always be a thing so get over it
[comment]I didn’t read the article so don’t behead me but it’s talking about illegal immigrants right?
[comment]Immigrants shouldn't even be immigrants, they should be back where they belong.  The jobs they are doing now will mostly be done by robots in a decade or two, so even if they are working now they'll be on welfare then.
[comment]Technically illegal and legal immigrants are not allowed to use social services, until they become citizens.

In the process of becoming a legal citizen, whoever is your sponsor is responsible for paying the government back for any social service you use.(except for stuff like public roads, police, schools etc)

Problem is that the government doesn’t pursue these people who go on welfare or food stamps cause it’s not worth their time/money

I say she can shove a damn scooter with that cart.
[comment]FUCK NO!
[comment]Jesus Christ, this viewpoint is outdated by decades. Illegal immigrants are the backbone of our economy. Alabama had some of the strictest immigration policies, but they couldn't sustain it. The economy hurt too much because buisnesses couldn't find cheap labor. It's proven again and again, immigrants are a net benefit. Immigrants shouldn't be the ones you are mad at, they don't have any power. Be mad at corporations only care about money.
[comment]This country was founded on the principles of immigration, to take in people from all around the world. 

Welfare is killing the core of American principles because the more welfare you have, the stricter immigration protocols you need. If you remove welfare, it wouldn't matter how many immigrants we take, it would only serve to increase our population multiplier and help us compete with population giants like China and India.

[comment]What happens to the illegal alien who spends 20 to 30 years working under the table then because of health issues no longer can work? In one case that I know of he married a citizen and had 2 sons. What happens eventually when he can't work? Or have serious health issues?
[comment]Public charge is the law, period.  We’re not the world dumpster for welfare cases
[comment]Yeah I agree
[comment]Any illegal can get a fraudulent social security number.
[comment]Immigrants shouldnt be here at all
[comment]Nobody should be one welfare! Conservatives need to understand this. It incentives poor decision making while penalizing responsibility.
[comment]correction illegal but legal tax paying law abiding immigrants in need should have the right to it
[comment]Neither should banks &amp; corporations
[comment]Bold statement for someone within milkshaking distance. Btw just a joke.
[comment]ITT: just...a lot of racism
[comment]Well I pay my taxes and I know why society is better for it. I if lawmakers would value human life over being afraid of immigrants and he poor then we might actually move forward as human beings.
[comment]I agree. Immigrants(especially illegal immigrants) that aren’t U.S. citizens yet should be on social welfare unless it is left/death situation.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Pigs don’t care what color you are, we are their enemies.
[comment]It's a very disturbing article. Good police are invaluable, and bad police are dangerous.

But a single video to prove a point about race is misleading. The best study I've seen on the topic is here:

*An Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police Use of Force*

TLDR, there is a higher rate of non-lethal use of force on black Americans. The rate of shootings is about equal for between black and white Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On non-lethal uses of force, there are racial differences –sometimes quite large –in police use of force, even after accounting for a large set of controls designed to account for important contextual and behavioral factors at the time of the police-civilian interaction. Interestingly, as use of force increases from putting hands on a civilian to striking them with a baton, the overall probability of such an incident occurring decreases dramatically but the racial difference remains roughly constant. **Even when officers report civilians have been compliant and no arrest was made, blacks are 21.3 (0.04) percent more likely to endure some form of force**. Yet, **on \[officer-involved shootings\] we are unable to detect any racial differences** in either the raw data or when accounting for controls.
[comment]So are we going to be having race wars every summer before a presidential election now, like the Olympics, except they don’t get canceled?
[comment]But which ones burn down cities every election year?
[comment]Ok so let's do something about cops killing our citizens of all races.
[comment]Yeah, Americans know. No ones falling for this nonsense. Its 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Looks like Novembers going to be a breeze.
[comment]Yeah, happens to every race. One particular one more than most. Also are you trying to justify this by saying it happens to every race? Or are you saying that because it's such a problem now is the time to work together to fight against it?
[comment]You're statistically more likely to be killed by a cop if you're white than if you're black. This whole "it's open season on blacks for cops" is such bullshit and it's blatantly obvious
[comment]Wow and no riots, no candle-light vigils really makes me think
[comment]Expect whites down burn down entire cities when it happens
[comment]The problem is far bigger than just race. Race is the excuse many of these dirtbags use to hide their culpability.

Remind me again, what party has run Dallas for decades?
[comment]Its not just black people protesting. I really hope people see that.
[comment]Only in this case there were no riots. No reportage. No looting. No protests. No nothing. Why? Because he was white. I am sick and fuckin tired of the Caucasian race being trampled on or fought against or ignored. If we’re all to coexist peacefully together then all lives matter, not just black. Or brown. Or whatever color you are.
[comment]Nothing new. So what about the tens of thousands of innocent people murdered annually due to gang violence? That's ok right? That doesn't deserve any reaction or critical attention? More people lose their life prematurely due to gang violence than police brutality could ever touch. And this has been a trend for decades. 

I know people will want a source so this is statistical value for one location in one year. Long story short. 700+ murdered, 4k shootings and this is from just one location in one year. This isn't taking into account for the injuried due to gang related shootings. So just imagine if you start adding up all death due to gang related shootings around the United States, the numbers would astronomical in comparison to police brutality deaths. I'm not advocating for what this cop did but this info starts to shed a little light into the underlining issues and how this is mostly ignored.

https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-homicides-data-tracker-htmlstory.html

Downvote all you like, but this is the reality of gang violence.
[comment]To be fair cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by cocaine and the stress of the altercation. Cops need to be retrained.
[comment]Wife was up late with me last night/this morning, talking about this very thing.

White people are expected to die and be forgotten.
That's why these things come and go.

Until we start doing the same shit, burning down news stations for printing bullshit lies, they won't respect us and this will keep happening.

That, or just have a lot of kids, vote responsibly, and pray every day for a miracle.
[comment]So my question is, what happened to these police? Did any of them get investigated? Are they being brought up on charges? How often do these sorts of things happen and it doesn't get reported? Why was that elderly Indian man killed and there was barely a peep- are Indians no longer "brown" people? Why didn't the media report the FBI was investigating from the instant it came out? Could it be the media has a narrative they want us to follow, and we're all falling for it? Those hashtags that have 20 names, why have I only heard of maybe 5? Why is this story over a year old and I'm only learning of it now, when the same exact thing happened to someone else?  Maybe it isn't a race thing. Maybe its a media playing the public thing.
[comment]An attack on one group of citizens is an attack on all of us. It doesn’t matter who is suffering unjustly. If there is unjust suffering then it needs to be taken care of. We had wars about this, people ! 

Don’t let anyone divide us !
[comment]Privatize law enforcement along with everything else.
[comment]We can now deduce that cops have no regard for human life
[comment]Do you guys remember when we rioted in the streets after Tony Timpa’s death? Yeah, neither do I. So weird.
[comment]I find it very telling that this is posted on r/republican and also reposted from r/libertarian
[comment]Police brutality is a real thing, because humans are humans, it’s not always a race thing. The real problem is the politicians and media who want every incident to be about race. What happens to these cities of the police force closes, hint..l just watch the rioters....err I mean peaceful protesters.
[comment]This is not a movement about black lives mattering more. 

Black lives matter *enough* to address the lethal culture creeping through law enforcement unchecked. 

There are a few bad cops that abuse their power and are acting as judge,jury,and executioner. They have multiple accounts of inappropriate interactions with the citizens they are sworn to protect. There are many officers who are aware of this, witness it and instead of fighting to end it they stand by their brother in blue to protect him in solidarity.  

I don’t agree with looting and burning and violence. But I completely agree with the protests and the messaging. 

There are good cops but they failed to reform a system that is killing people.
[comment]Go on and try the solidarity approach.

Just dont cry when they beat you over a MAGA hat
[comment]No one is saying that this ONLY happens to black people, they are upset that it DISPROPORTIONATELY happens to black people. The peaceful protests (not the violent ones) are against police brutality that is hurting the black community. The white man's death was a tragedy... But what does that have to do with this situation?
[comment]That doesn't make it okay, fool.

[comment]this is the reach of the century. If you wanna go outside and die from covid go ahead bro.
[comment]Millions of American veterans have willingly sacrificed life and limb to protect the lives of their fellow citizens.

And then there are these people.

I think it is reasonable to take economic hardships and mental health into consideration, and propose alternative measures to a total lockdown. 

It is not reasonable to recklessly endanger the lives of your fellow citizens.

It is patriotic to engage in social distancing for the sake of your fellow Americans. Everyone who CAN make sacrifices should make them without complaint.
[comment]Some people just want an excuse to dress in public like their in special forces.

I’m a veteran and I can’t stand all these pretenders who think putting on their tacticool gear makes them some kind of hero.

[comment]Wow. Some people are really stupid? I am glad these idiots are all gathering together during this pandemic and protesting.

[comment]Going out with rifles to protest the governor(s) telling you to stay home unless it’s absolutely necessary to combat the spread of a disease that might kill you/you might unknowingly spread to someone else doesn’t make you look patriotic, it makes you look like a terrorist.

[comment]Said a famous slave owner...
[comment]yeah so i don’t want covid19

if i felt like leaving i would

don’t know/care if it’s legal
[comment]The US is opening back the country, but please, for the love of God, don’t go outside more than necessary.

We’re going through a pandemic. It’s not about not being able to go outside, but more about the risks of going outside and infecting more and more people.

Don’t make medical worker’s life harder than it already is. Stay inside as much as possible and stay hygienic.
[comment]Lockdowns, the new pandemic
[comment]I agree with the quote but can anyone confirm he said that
[comment]Been there, had that. Coronavirus is nothing to bitch about. I don’t understand all of the negative reactions to this post. Obviously nobody wants to go out and spread a deadly disease that kills a bunch a of people. It’s not actually very deadly at all. It basically only kills older or immunocompromised people. This is the United States. If I want to go out and put myself at risk of a “deadly disease”, then I should have the right to do that. Anybody who is at risk of dying should stay home while the rest of us go on about our lives. Practice good hygiene and don’t get in people’s faces but don’t wreck the entire country’s economy and ruin millions offamily’s lives.

[comment]You know they did quarantines back in Jefferson’s day, right?

This is not 1984, COVID is not a hoax, and you’re not Paul Revere. 

Seriously, y’all are making us all look like idiots. 

I’m not saying don’t open the economy. I said from day 1 that quarantines were unsustainable financially and would wreck the economy. I also said I didn’t think the death rate was anywhere near 3.4%. 

But the fact remains that it is highly contagious and overruns hospitals. Go look up what happened in Albany Ga. That’s what will happen if we do absolutely nothing. 

And my point is that there are many conservatives who advocating for exactly that - go back to the way it was before with zero precautions. That’s a very stupid mindset. 

I think opening back up, with common sense social distancing is the only way.
[comment]How tf you gonna say like no nature please don’t send a virus because I have a right to a haircut. Bitch no there is no such thing as the human right to haircut. Stay inside you ignorant fucks.

[comment]this quote would be alot stronger if it wasn't from a guy who owned 600  slaves throughout his life
[comment]On Sept. 1, 1793, Jefferson wrote to his closest friend Madison
&gt; “Every body, who can, is flying from the city, and the panic of the country people is likely to add famine to disease. Tho becoming less mortal, it is still spreading, and the heat of the weather is very unpropitious. I have withdrawn my daughter from the city, but am obliged to go to it every day myself.” 

Though Jefferson was an "essential worker" he sent his family into quarantine, and indeed lost close family to the yellow fever outbreak of 1793.

<|startoftext|>[title]Democrats Would Rather Blame Trump Than China for the Pandemic
[selftext]https://www.theepochtimes.com/democrats-would-rather-blame-trump-than-china-for-the-pandemic_3309825.html[comment]They would blame Trump if they personally overcooked toast.
[comment]Sad but very true
[comment]Some good things / decisions that have happened..... Travel restrictions to China, expediting clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as possible treatment, massive hospital ships in NY and LA, and stimulus checks for most americans. 

I think US leadership is trying. I think Trump was trying to be hopeful and not panic or act rashly on information he couldn't verify or didn't trust. No one is perfect. 

However, the WHO leadership refused to identify that the virus was doing the damage it had done within China and declare a worldwide crisis until 30 Jan, likely after the virus had already spread throughout the world. The WHO must have known human to human transmission was occurring within China, as the reported cases reached 11,600 and deaths reached 260. It is also well known now that China Iikely lied about how many died to cover up how bad it was, and the WHO went along with it.

[comment]Unless Donald Trump had a frickin’ lab where he invented the damn virus, there’s no way he’s responsible for it. People are so stupid. Yellowstone can blow its top and those who survive will say it’s his fault.
[comment]China invests in silicon valley and big tech.

Silicon valley and big tech donate to Democrats

Democrats give favorable treatment and cover for China.

China invests in silicon valley and big tech....
[comment]Shouldn’t we be blaming Putin in that case?
[comment]I wish trump was harder on China earlier about testing and being transparent. Along with that, I wish he’d, like Fauci, would admit his mistake of downplaying the virus. I’m happy with the budget cut he imposed on the WHO. They deserve no penny from us as they were knowingly allowing China lie to every other country and report false data. The CCP is responsible for a lot of deaths.
[comment]r/Republican has been taken over by liberals and mean while I can’t post a thing lol. I think I’m done with Reddit.
[comment]That’s a surprise to who?
[comment]They blamed Trump for having an extra scoop of ice cream at a White House dinner; I mean what do you expect from a party that is led by mentally inept people?!
[comment]Fuck DemocRATS
[comment]"I blame Ford for building shitty cars and not the mechanic who didnt do their job when the check engine light was on."
[comment]How exactly do the leftist trolls here square their belief that Donald Trump is personally responsible for the Pandemic, with the fact that most Americans both think he's doing a good job AND that China is primarily responsible for this?
[comment]At this point its a Mad libs game.

"Democrats Would Rather Blame Trump Than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
[comment]It’s probably because they have ties to China
[comment]I would love to see Trump do and say the opposite of what he really wants. Just to see the Libs attack his view. Then say you know what, I think I changed my mind.
[comment]They could have done much more sooner
[comment]The American people have very little control over China. We can point out the failings of Xi and his authoritarian regime but there is very little recourse for us. 

Trump is the head of the US government and his response has been poor. We as Americans have the ability to change our own government and therefore, criticism of our own is a more productive conversation to have because we actually have the ability to fix things on our end.
[comment]I identify myself as a democrat but seeing people blaming everything on Trump instead of recognising that China and WHO should take most of the responsibilities on the pandemic hurts my brain
[comment]On January 24, Trump tweeted: "China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!
[comment]It really shows how terrible they are. Just the fact that they would rather throw blame around rather than help fix the issue.
[comment]U.S. and its allies should boycott all Chinese goods, withdraw all companies from China, make them pay for all the damages they have caused in the current crisis, recognize Taiwan as the only legitimate 'China', and support separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. These are my five points to hold China accountable for causing this pandemic. Any other points would be appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]California... A great place to be a Republican

[comment]How tolerant.
[comment]"Remind me who the facists are..."

People on all sides.
[comment]I live in California. I have many ultra liberal friends.  


I do not doubt this happens AT ALL. It is just surprising sometimes because I have mayyyyyybe met 1 or 2 people that were this zealous in their political beliefs to take things that far.
[comment]Can’t come out as an “R” word in CA.  Can’t wear Red hats or put stickers on your car or else vandalized.  Get called racist even though you’re a minority.  Tolerant non violent left.
[comment]I’m sorry if this guy is having troubles socializing and private life matters(kids, wife, etc), because that all sounds f’d up. 

...but losing major clients and countless projects? It doesn’t sound like you “came out as a republican”. It sounds like you are actively injecting politics into your business dealings, and people think it’s unprofessional. 

If you were a civil engineer, I would want to know if the bridge is safe- not if you think the funding came from the wrong place, etc. Why would you be talking about politics with clients? I would recommend avoiding politics with any client in any business, unless of course, it’s political. 

Alternatively, it could just be correlation instead of causation. Maybe the economy is slowing and funds are drying up, but he thinks it’s because of a recent post he made? Just seems too far fetched to not have more detail. 

But again, that other stuff is f’d if true.
[comment]I mean the whole country *HATES* California so I wouldn't be surprised this is their way of coping. It's their safe space hahaha
[comment]I left Ca about 9 years ago, best choice of my life. Born and raised there, and that place is seriously going to shit, I’ll visit my family and after 2 days I can’t wait to get home where people are normal.
[comment]“Come out as a republican” what the fuck does that even mean lol. I knew Califoria was shit but damn.
[comment]In other news a man on a purple bicycle has shot an arrow at a homeless person! Skyrim hold guards say “we are still looking for him.” 

Next: Homeless man has arrow in the knee!
[comment]A civil war is coming. It'll be a war based in an opposition of philosophies. If I were a religious man, I'd say it's a precursor to Armeggedon, the "last battle" before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

[comment]I grew up in California. Went to a mexican roman catholic church every sunday with my best friends family, despite not being a catholic or speaking Spanish. Went to more cinceyetas (spelling) than I can count.

[comment]In the past both Dems and Reps annoyed me but now days its definitely the left. I might not agree with evething on the right but at least they are not bat shit crazy like the left
[comment]None if that behavior strikes me as particularly fascistic. It fulfills many qualities of it but appears to lack nationalism. It looks more like aggressive tribalism than an attitude of fascism.

She made a comment about how she hoped the dems could impeach trump and referenced Ukraine so I brought up Uncle Joe.  

She confirmed I was Republican and said "I don't associate with Trump supporters."  

I don't understand the people who live in their bubble and avoid people who arent Liberal.   It blows my mind.
[comment]It's all good. Just pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
[comment]Move man
[comment]I am sorry to hear about the treatment you and your family are receiving. Stay safe! If people bring it up I always throw out the law of the 3 unmentionable topics in public. No talk of sex, religion or politics jokingly and try to lighten the mood. Sometimes it works lol! Well anyways, I wanted to right you to try and be of some help after reading your post. I looked into moving to California this past year and after all the research I've done on the subject, I find myself questioning on why I really even wanted to head out west in the 1st place... See here in Erie, PA, there is lots to do and see too! Its all around you just like in Ca! Its just a short drive to Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo and so many other towns and places for a weekend get-a-way or day trips. If you like the outdoors we have the beauty of all 4 seasons here, there are so many hiking trails to explore, creeks for fishing and land for hunting. The best part about living in Erie is that it sits right on Lake Erie! With the breathtaking sunsets and its endless number of beaches! The cost of living is way less and it has lots of schools/colleges. I couldnt afford much out in Ca I come to find out. Living here, one could even afford lakefront property with private beach access, for a fraction of the money.  Again, I am so sorry to hear about you and your family having a hard time with being there. In this State you shouldn't be bullied about your beliefs and traditions. I urge you to at least check it out, worst comes to worst, you can always go back right?
[comment]this is genuinely gut wrenching
[comment]I'm personally a Democrat, with many Republican friends, (I just like to see both sides of everything, thats why I'm here in the first place) and I cannot believe this. To take politics to such a level is completely irrational. I mean, I've disagreed with my friends on many occasions. But I've never thought to bring any sort of harm or anything to them. And what is the point? If you disagree with someone's agenda, then why would you fuel them with dirt on your party? Oh, I want more people to agree with my idea, so let's do all this stupid stuff to make us look like even bigger idiots. Sometimes I wonder how I associate with any political party at all.
[comment]Its crazy!!!! A guy I met here basically thinks this way. If you support trump you're a racist... it's like what?! I really want to move out when I can! Maybe to a swing state and help flip it Red just because..

But the way many of the liberals here have their own special flavor of hate makes so many of their taking points of acceptance and tolerance seem hollow and superficial.

[comment]I posted on fb and got banned for a week for posting my dislike for the chinese government. It got algorithmed as “hate speech” and I got booted. I got my account back and immediately posted how you can not oppose the chinese government, but can openly threaten our president, Can’t have conservative views, or plan a peaceful protest. Caught a month ban. 

While the posts were up I got called racist and an uneducated trumper.
[comment]Very true. I said that if there is a disease going around, it is natural going to have people die from it, and I got mass downvoted. It’s crazy how deranged the liberals here on reddit are. Don’t even get me started about twitter...
[comment]My first few days on reddit I posted what I thought was a pretty middle of the road headline asking for thoughts and got shitted on for being a Nazi
[comment]I had someone comment on mine saying I needed my vote taken away because I’m white hahahaha.

[comment]I understand the anger and frustration over the failure of our leaders to effect change as promised.  The centers of protests that turned into chaos is in Democrat controlled cities, Democrat controlled counties and States. Biden, Schumer,  Hoyer, and Pelosi have been in Congress for over 40 yrs.  Democrats have controlled Congress for all but 4 yrs since 1932.
After 8 yrs of Obama policies and what I don't understand is how POC repeatedly vote for people that talk shit about the opposition and then dont do shit for their constituents.
[comment]It's so disappointing to see you guys look at yet another issue as us vs them. Both "sides" have valid points. Both "sides" have made mistakes. You're loyal to a political party instead of your fellow humans. Feckless, idiots. I'm so disappointed in my country. Not everything has to be a political debate(although the rich and powerful are glad you're so easily distracted). If this country ever fails don't blame "the other side", blame yourself.


Edit: thank you for the gold. We are in this together, not divided.
[comment]Truth!
[comment]“The political beliefs of our mayor directly impact our decision to be shitty violent looters!” - said nobody in this entire country
[comment]It should say "the protesters can't get us from up here"
[comment]and look at a lot of superiors in the police force. putting your officers in danger to take people’s guns to further your political view. how bout you come take em yourself. democrats can not be in charge of the police force. i don’t get it. how do the people that make their officers take guns still have jobs? it’s clearly against the constitution
[comment]A majority of the riots are happening in heavy liberal cities. I'll never understand why they blame Republicans and conservative for the racism when so many of these incidents happen in their own backyards.
[comment]Yes it's all because of two different political parties. Thank you clarifying, you've solved everything!

[comment]Pretty ironic considering that decades of right-leaning policy dragged us into this.
[comment]In Kansas City, we have a liberal mayor, but he has pretty conservative views in terms of law enforcement so violence has been able to be kept to a minimum
[comment]Do they charge by the letter? Why the wording so dumb?
[comment]i love it !
[comment]Got that right my state of commie Cal is about as corrupt and lawless as they come thanks to the Democrats. I live just North of Fresno Cal a few years ago the second in command at the Fresno PD was a Black man who was arrested and charged with drug running. Fresno is a major drug distribution hub for the Mexican mafia for California. The illegal alien gangs in Fresno run rampant. When I first moved here it was common to read in the Fresno newspaper about dead burnt bodies being found in farm fields at least twice a week.
[comment]I mean yes to this post but our President also decided to throw fuel on this fire and then proceed to do literally nothing.
[comment]I do wonder if Dems are facing a shalacking this year. Several special elections where they should have won they lost. Hope people are waking up.

[comment]Joes so senile, he thinks he’s black
[comment]I wonder if Corn Pop is gonna vote for Joe Biden
[comment]An unbelievable statement in 2020. Is this really the best Democrats can offer?
[comment]To me, Biden was clearly trying to "act black." He was talking real fast and using slang and completely out of his usual slow character, and I think he was trying to prove that he's not ancient by catering to the black man he was talking to.
[comment]How the fuck did people choose Joe "segregationist" Biden over Bernie Sanders, the man who has championed civil rights for decades?

Smh.
[comment]Well he’s a democrat and he agrees with everything he is supposed to so
[comment]Still at it huh Joe? Same crap you tried with Justice Thomas. 

Punish the "uppety blacks who dare think for themselves" right?

Twatwaffle.
[comment]Republicans:no

Leftist:well no but actually yes
[comment]I mean, weren’t journalists defending his statement almost immediately afterwards and saying it’s the truth?
[comment]I haven’t been watching TV since he said this . Is anyone reporting on it on main stream media ?

He got away with saying they are gonna our y’all back in chains
[comment]I find this deeply offensive against people of color(myself included, being mixed Caucasian and Indigenous), my best friend sent this to me with the a “Hey guess what, I’m not voting democrat anymore.” Attached to this, at least some are “woke” in this regard to use a favorite term by the Left.
[comment]Tried to post an article about this on r/Democrats and it got removed in less than 5 minutes lol “already been posted” . I looked for Charlamagne, Biden, Ain’t black keywords on the sub and nothing popped up smh

[comment]Quid pro Joe is a racist POS, just like Obama.

He should get Maxine Waters as a running mate then he would only be 2nd dumbest
[comment]It’s (D)ifferent when we do it...
[comment]I wonder if this will be his “47%” gaffe that will cost him the election?

Just don’t look at your watch, Joe. (Showing my age)

Clarify: for the record, I voted for Romney, but it was a bit of an unfortunate slip.
[comment]hahaha I love this! It's gonna be Blackie Joe and Shamu Abrams. Good luck with that. America will not vote for that combination if you catch my drift.
[comment]I’m pretty sure that Biden could literally purchase a black person and force them to pick cotton and the African American community in America would still vote for him because Obama.

[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-rogan-id-rather-vote-for-trump-than-biden[comment]We agree Rogan. Trump isn’t perfect but Biden would be a disaster and ultimately you would be voting for his VP to take over as president as he’s not even mentally fit now let alone in 2021 and beyond.
[comment]Joe Rogan also would rather vote for Bernie Sanders
[comment]It’s an easy decision for most of us.  I’ve always been on the fence between left and right.. I doubt I’ll ever vote again after these last 4 years. They really are some crazy mofos, really extreme. There is no disagreeing with them on any topic, and if you do, you are no longer welcome in their crew..
[comment]The Democrat party is not equipped to rule America. There are fundamental flaws in the system that they used in picking their candidate. Remember how the Iowa primary was a complete clusterfuck?
[comment]Rogan is an idiot. He knows nothing about politics and wavers every time he brings on a guest that gets him hard. Dudes just playing the game.
[comment]He might have actually grown a brain.
[comment]Joe was going to respond to this, but he forgot.
[comment]Shhhh, don’t say anything about it.
[comment]Finally, someone sensible in this crazy world.
[comment]I thought I felt an earthquake yesterday... Now I know what was it. Boom!
[comment]Hell yeah! If Biden became President we'd see at least 10 million unemployed and Thousands of deaths. Not like prepared President Trump!
[comment]either way i’m not a fan of him and have never been
[comment]Hes still stupid for thinking Bernie Sanders is a good candidate
[comment]That isn’t really saying much. Anyone with a brain can see Biden is out to lunch mentally
[comment]I think I figured out why sleepy Joe seems so off; the DNC had to scoop out part of his brains to install the remote control.
[comment]Just because somebody has a microphone in front of his face doesn't make them intelligent, nor informed. Take Donald Trump for istance
[comment]Because Joe Rogan is a disgusting person who sometimes cloaks it.
[comment]He didn’t say this.
[comment]🎶Hail to the Chief we have chosen for the nation...🎶
[comment]Nice
[comment]Why is this a big deal?
[comment]This is the same guy who said he'd vote for Bernie Sanders, lol. I dont think Joe knows much about politics.
[comment]HAHA. Honestly, he shouldn't be giving political advice, at all. Any white male who says they'd vote for Bernie, shouldn't be listened to.
[comment]Bernie Sanders is a spoiled stupid old man who's political beliefs are literally not figurative literally the closest this to nazi Germany. Socialism has never worked and it will never work. And if I do make a bunch of money I'm not paying 81 percent in taxes I've move and take my money with me
[comment]As someone who has worked in the senior living industry for years, including Memory Care units.  I really believe that Biden is showing early signs of dementia.  His brain - speech connection is failing him.  Pray for the guy as a human being, but the man cannot be president.
[comment]Every Bernie supporter would vote Trump or not at all...
[comment]He said he would vote for Whoopi Goldberg before he voted for Biden and he would vote for Hilary as well. He’s a liberal with some conservative values.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Smh. Crazy woman...
[comment]Can just imagine everyone in the world flying in for surgeries. Never heard of such a ridiculous thing even in counties with socialized medicine!
[comment]We’re paying for their medical coverage regardless.  Complaining is stupid.  Come up with solutions.
[comment]Even some of my Democrat friends don’t agree with healthcare for illegals. I’d say it’s split 50/50. About half think they should have, the other half thinks they shouldn’t. Not too bad if I do say so myself, considering I live in LA
[comment]She has no interest in winning does she?
[comment]Here is how it will go down if they cover illegals

1.) Democrats believe in open borders.
2.) Instead of paying for expensive treatments themselves, Latin American governments pay for a bus ride to the US border and tell their patients to get their expensive medical treatments in the US.
3.) All thru the border state, the hospitals are jammed with illegals. Why? Because Latin America off loaded their sick and terminally ill that require expensive treatments on us.
4.) Once treated and healthy, illegals go back to their home country.
5.) The tax payers are played for a fool.
[comment]No.
[comment]What I don't get is why their own country won't cover them, and why nobody's calling their countries out on it.
[comment]Sit the fuck down, lady.  You're done.
[comment]Her plans will bankrupt this nation and we will end up in a depression
[comment]Congratulations, you played yourself.
[comment]I don't think any of y'all understand that if we don't start taking care of our people, the American Empire  will become a third world shithole real quick.
[comment]It’s like the UK NHS , ain’t gunna last long.
[comment]Hey you could very well be right and I respect that you have a strong opinion on this. And I am not trying to change your mind on either subject for it is clear your opinion has been formed. But here are my final thoughts for the sake of having a respectful disagreement. 

Re: border - While some far-left dems believe in open borders, it is an over-generalization to say *all* do and it is clearly not the platform of the entire party. It is only what far-right media sources claim their platform is. But it just isn’t.  And Beto lives in a border state and can have his own opinion about the border. Personally, I don’t think a wall, which has already proved to not work, is the right solution. And I think it is silly to spend billions for something people can climb or saw through. And unfortunately for Trump, more people in this country agree with this sentiment. It isn’t just the “dems” it is the majority of the American population. Just because he won doesn’t mean he can impose his will wherever he wants, he still has to convince us that he has the right solution for the problem, and a majority in this country believe this isn’t the solution. 

Re: Healthcare - The “people could take advantage of this” argument is fair, but can also be made about any policy. In almost any policy decision someone benefits and someone doesn’t. I may be naive about this particular argument, but I also don’t believe social progress shouldn’t be made just because there is a concern some people may benefit from a decision and that I may be paying for it in some way. The benefits here may outweigh the cost and that is something we should consider for a better world. We should be seeking opinions and analysis from experts to understand these costs, and instead we hear a few media personalities and mirror their opinions without forming our own. That’s all I am saying. 

You may be right in the end and I am open to that. But I am not going to rush to any decision without respectfully listening to both sides.
[comment]This is all racial politics. If the people sneaking in we're White and we're generally conservative-minded oh, it would be huge social movement stop it. But because the Democrats have made being Hispanic a political issue, because they need somebody to give them votes, all common sense is gone out the window.

<|startoftext|>[title]Hedge fund manager predicts huge market sell-off if a 'socialist' wins in 2020
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hedge-fund-manager-predicts-huge-market-sell-off-if-a-socialist-wins-in-2020[comment]First of all, it isn't going to happen, but yes, if it did, the market would completely crash. Why would the market NOT crash when prosperity destroying socialists take power?
[comment]&gt;  I gained insight into how far to the right both the Democratic and Republican parties were 

This is a quote I took form a socialist forum literally 30 seconds ago. God forbid you voice your opinion here too you'll be called a racist alt-right whatever. These people are crazy. If they love socialism overseas so much, why the hell wouldn't they move there? 

 My take on this is *if* a socialist were to win, people would sell anything they had **quickly** and move money offshore as fast as they could to keep what they worked hard for and not to give it to the government (I'm sure it's more technical than this but I wouldn't doubt it not happening). The market will drop several thousand points and unemployment will be at an all time high. Either way, I believe another recession is coming and if socialism wins, we will stay in a recession for many years to come. Just my prediction.
[comment]So just buy up the fallen stocks and make bank.
[comment]Socialists≠Economics
[comment]I’m assuming those would equate to “limited” government involvement in the economy
[comment]Trump will won in 2020 but we will probably get a Democrat in 2024. At that point it will be time to pull your money out of the stock market. I plan to pull mine at ~6 months before the election and wait until we go into a recession, then buy back in.
[comment]Ya bud. Let me know when anyone who’s under 50 right now sees their social security money. Because it’s never going to happen.
[comment]This happens EVERY. SINGLE. ELECTION. This is not news or even remotely true. There will be no "sell off" this is scare tactics by the rich which should surprise no one.

[comment]Don’t call it a gun buyback. I didn’t buy my firearms from the government. I bought them from FFLs and private party. The government isn’t paying me for my guns. They’re raising my taxes, taking my money, and using my money to buy my guns for substantially less than I paid for them. NO THANKS.

[comment]He's still pushing on that Overton window I see.
[comment]This guy can go shove his nose up Hillary's nose, thanks.
[comment]His original last name was “Bet”, but he wanted to be more Spanish.
[comment]First, cops(state, county, and city) are not federal employees. They have an oath to uphold the constitution but not one to obey the president.

Second, a vast majority of police, like my city and county police, support the second amendment. They privately own multiple firearms. Just look at the clothing choices and tattoos to get an insight.

Grunt style, Ranger up, and 5.11 being popular choices. American flag tats along with ar-15s and military style artwork.

Last, even if he were to send in the National Guard, a good portion would join our side and deplete their numbers.

When I went through the academy in 2016, one guy said he was voting for Hilary. The other 32 recruits were against her on principle alone. Even my former department all voted for Trump. And even though I'm no longer working there, I keep in close contact. They all support the second amendment rights of every citizen. Anecdotal, sure. But this is my experience.

[comment]Sounds reasonable. 🙄
[comment]Beto's got my vote for 2024.  Dems are coming for our guns eventually, and the worst case scenario for us is if they do it gradually.  Best case is if they make it clear that its 'put up or shut up' time.
[comment]Because that will most definitely, almost certainly, 100% satisfaction guaranteed, stop mass shootings in the United States. 
Yeah okay, sure. Ignore the fact that there's a black market, ignore the fact that other, possibly worse, massacres could happen. Believe the faulty mindset that banning guns will stop mass shootings. Believe that logic from the Purge movies where after 24 hours of illegal acts becoming legal, everything magically goes back to normal.
[comment]I'm so glad we didn't elect this jackass last year

Even /r/Texas which is uber liberal has abandoned him as a lunatic loser.
[comment]Anyone who would run on such a policy proposal is just out of touch with mainstream America, and thus shouldn’t be elected to represent anyone
[comment]This commie is just the worst.
[comment]Why do people even buy this crap? Politicians do this nonsense all the time before they’re elected. They lie.

So, if you know anything about the law, you know that disarming Americans is a lot more nuanced than simply sending cops to get guns. It’s never going to happen. He is just trying to appeal to mega liberals.

No.
[comment]Can we just let these people hold a microphone and keep them talking?
[comment]No way beto is this stupid, I'm betting he knows he could never take away people's guns but is just saying it to win over the emotional voters. In short, he says this shit because he thinks it makes him popular.
[comment]No, you won't. None will survive such an attempt soy boy.
[comment]Beto is just digging hard into this narrative and I will be quite surprised if he ever holds office again in Texas. I think we should all take this as a blessing as it also looks bad for the rest of the Democratic party.
[comment]He looks like one of those people who need a nice hard slap across the face

[comment]I can't believe that Donald Trump was being accused of trying to incite a civil war.

Beto's plan would literally result in civil bloodshed.

Molon labe.

[comment]To all the police and people saying that they wouldn’t help with the enforcement of the law, remember that when Hitler rose to power he gathered around him an army to do his policing for him. By the time he was second in charge he had 4 million brownshirts (storm troopers) compared to germany’s army and police only having 50,000. Most takeovers are dependent on a para military that has the real power and a weak police and state army.

[comment]It’s not legal for a government funded agency. However, here we are....
[comment]This is such bullshit
[comment]I’m surprised trump hasn’t put an end to money towards PP, NPR, etc
[comment]this isn't new--they've been spending money on politics and elections for years. They do it through their Super Pac. it's legal because they do it through the super pac and other 501c4 entities
[comment]It's legal because there are distinct, separate entities involved. The political committees do not receive money from governments but only donations from the public which are not tax deductible. That's the money those entities spend on political stuff. The money that other entities get from government only goes to allowable stuff, like dispensing healthcare, none of which involves abortions. Plenty of other organizations have similar structures where you can make tax deductible deductions to one part of the organization or non-deductible donations to their political arms.
[comment]Isn't this kind of argument a logical fallacy? This would be the same if the Feds gave money to a teacher's unions or a nonprofit that helps to feed the hungry and they then use donations they get (not the money the feds give them) to help fund elections to support candidates that would help support them to get even more funding for teachers or food banks?   


Also, people seem to forget that they also do family planning and std testing.
[comment]We did it...its simple. Citizens United made A merica political donation crack heads...
[comment]What’s twitchy?
[comment]Wait that sounds like Corp money in politics.
[comment]Better than spending it on killing babies.
[comment]That’s called lobbying, sir
[comment]Convincing your political party to off their kids sounds like a great way to get rid of your political party.
[comment]1. What's the difference between a non-profit organization like Planned Parenthood providing financial and other forms of endorsements into politics and a church/religious organization that will lose their non-profit status if they state the name of their preferred candidate from the pulpit? 
2. Any organization, regardless of political affiliation should be immediately disqualified from any and all possibility of government funding if any of their money goes to a political organization. This should be a given, but government funds can't be used to financially support one political party over another.
[comment]OP I completely agree with you but you were asking for the resistance by putting the name of the Abortion Factory in the title. The place Democrats created to keep poor black communities from expanding (it’s true, look it up). Libs love them some aborted babies.  

Anyhow, the lib trolls already browse this sub even though they hate everything R’s stand for, including country and the nuclear family. They browse knowing there’s nothing here they’d ever agree with so their whole plan is to downvote and show off their TDS side effects.  What a miserable thing to do.  

Go back to r/chapotraphouse , r/politics , r/Democrats or whatever echo chamber you crawled out of.
[comment]If they can donate to a political party they don't need government help.
[comment]It shouldn’t be legal, but they use a separate entity. If you want to make it illegal get rid of Citizens United.
[comment]Planned parenthood should be defunded and everyone there should be thrown out to live on the streets. 

Abortion is wrong. And benefiting financially from abortion is even worse. Using that money to influence the political outcome of an election is just sickening. Burn it all down.
[comment]If i ever ran for office as a Republican I would spend all my time talking about abortion while waving a gun on stage and I would probably get elected.
[comment]I’m asking this because I genuinely don’t know. Isn’t this basically what the NRA does? Both organizations have a separate entity that operates from private donations that they use for political purposes, right?
[comment]It's about to get even more legal if Trump and the GOP get rid of the Johnson Amendment which keeps 501c3 organizations from directly or indirectly intervening amd participating in in any political campaign.

[comment]Ok boomer
[comment]That's great! Almost cliche to be a young liberal, glad to see one person is meet it real.
[comment]I know this feeling, it's like why am I in trouble when everything I said was true
[comment]I just dont think this is helping anything.
[comment]You cute
[comment]This girl I hella cute though.
[comment]The right is getting better at comedy and its scaring the left
[comment]I was expecting some dude dressed as a Trump flag not some girl.
[comment]This is so fucking cringey.
[comment]Libtards are also emotionally unstable snowflakes. Doesn't take much for them to cry. Facts usually do the trick. 😭
[comment]Tik Tok is really conservative compared to other social media platforms and in this super liberal online world its really weird... I like it though.
[comment]You must have very low standards for comedy lol.
[comment]This is just cringy.
[comment]This isn’t even funny it’s low tier and cringe level and I’m not even liberal.
[comment]I read that as library card and was confused for a bit

[comment]Yeah, welcome to the new republicans.
[comment]HAHA FELLOW REPUBLICANS
[comment]Ladies and gentlemen, and those who are being needlessly critical of this. You do realize that these people are young, correct? Why would you just dump on young conservatives and republicans who are trying to stand up in the culture to a media that is utterly dominated by the left? Not only that, but how many of you were hilarious as high school students? How many of you find everything you found funny then as funny as you remember?

Cut them some slack. Be encouraging. You don't have to praise everything but ffs don't just shit on it. You're doing what the left is doing and helping beat our future comedians, our future cultural warriors, and our future spokespeople into the ground before they even fully develop their voices.
[comment]This is what repubs look like to sane people lol
[comment]I don't find this hilarious, kinda dry but ok
[comment]How'd you make one cry? What'd you do?

[comment]The current Democrats are sick, sick people.
[comment]Justice Kavanaugh's spectacle, the dems position on late term abortion. and the recent impeachment nonsense sealed it for me. These people are wicked, and I want nothing to do with them.
[comment]I would think that universal health care would decrease risk, as it would be easier for people to get medical care if they believe they have the virus.
[comment]But where are the other republicans, screaming to the media about it, the Republicans need to start getting on camera everywhere they can and point out how the democrats have been failures at everything forever.
[comment]What a group of awful humans those democrats are.
[comment]I seriously can’t believe Elizabeth Warren wants to divert funding for the “racist” wall to fight the coronavirus. How exactly does an open border policy help contain and control the outbreak???
[comment]These same idiots defended Obama when he refused to ban flights from Liberia during the Ebola outbreak.
[comment]Liberals are scum.
[comment]Yeah I don't know about that. M4A and paid time off for all would definitely help in this situation.
[comment]Is this a parity article?  No one thinks people want this thing to get out of control for political reasons.  Maybe the whitehouse is trying to get ahead of this by sending out this propaganda?
[comment]What exactly were the lies? Who knows what this could become. People just want it taken seriously. I think trump's initial downplay of coronavirus was to try to keep people and the markets from overreacting. 

But the fact that I saw people denying this is even a threat to try to make libs look stupid is probably the stupidest thing I have seen in a while. Fuck politics let's just pray it doesnt get out of control more than it has.
[comment]I feel like coronavirus is a punishment for all Trump's sins.
[comment]Trump is attempting to cut funding from the CDC, but it has not happened yet. As it stands, his proposal for the 2021 budget will attempt to cut CDC funding by 16% from what I've read. But congress hasn't approved the budget yet, so it hasn't gone to effect.
[comment]It should tell you how evil at their very core the left is.  They will legitimately work as hard as they can to see people suffer or die just to achieve the tiniest political victories.
[comment]Corona virus is not a joke. CHINA DOSENT SHUT DOWN A CITY OF 11million for no reason!!!!!!!!!!!!
[comment]In the interests of debate, copypasta'd from Snopes (if you believe in it or not, notwithstanding) and other sites:

#  What's True

The Trump administration's proposed 2021 budget includes cuts to the CDC's activities related to chronic disease. (ED: This is not set in stone, however, and will likely change on updated information)

 It is also true that in 2018 the Trump administration fired key officials connected to the U.S. pandemic response, and they were not replaced.  (ED: YMMV on to what extent this impacts a response; I would hazard that it would, but I cannot say to what extent)

# What's False

Congress hasn't approved the budget, so CDC funding in 2021 remains unclear. (ED: So, no the Administration has not cut funding, nor has Congress)

# Regarding the disease

From [www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/how-does-coronavirus-compare-with-previous-global](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/how-does-coronavirus-compare-with-previous-global)

&gt; World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Tarik Jašarević recently [estimated](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic) the COVID-19’s R naught (the number of other people one sick person is likely to infect on average) is around 2–2.5, whereas at least one study has suggested it could be as high as [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). Based on the number of confirmed deaths and cases, it has a case fatality rate (CFR) of around 2.65%. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is thought to have [originated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738798) in a Chinese ‘wet market’. Although more deadly than COVID-19 – it has a [CFR of 14–15%](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) – most cases of human-to-human transmission [occurred in healthcare settings](https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/) and it only made its way to 26 different countries before being contained.  
   
Its [estimated R naught](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/WHOconsensus.pdf) during the initial phase of the epidemic was 2.9, but the implementation of control measures reduced it to 0.4 in the final months of the outbreak. 

From  [https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-myths.html) 

&gt; The annual flu typically has a mortality rate of around 0.1% in the U.S. So far, there's a 0.05% mortality rate among those who caught the flu virus in the U.S. this year, according to the CDC. 

So as a summation, COVID's considerably not as dangerous as SARS (about 1/4th as dangerous, fatality-wise), and less infectious (by about 10% less), but substantially more dangerous than the common flu (at least in the US and presumably in most other 1st world countries).<|endoftext|>

[comment]Republican presidents also tried to get health care passed.  Nixon almost did it.  [Many president supported it](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-seven-presidents-barack-obama-s/) but it seems that insurance companies, big pharma and the health care industry opposed it because they make too much money under this system - in other words people pay way more than they would under a national health care program, regardless of who establishes it.  This is not a Republican / Democrat issue.
[comment]&amp;#x200B;

[Some Americans need a health care program.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/fc4p25/coronavirus_world_health_organisation_boss_tells/)

[comment]That’s absolutely preposterous but I’d expect nothing less from commies. They’re generally not big fans of transparency.
[comment]I'm pretty sure that NDA wouldnt be enforceable. It's a contract, which means both sides have to be giving/getting something. Not sure walking into an office constitutes a benefit.
[comment]I'd go in there and sign the NDA. If I happened to be wearing a hidden camera and the video accidentally got uploaded to YouTube, that wouldn't be my fault. I still wouldn't talk about it.

[comment]They are afraid of Project Veritas

Furthermore, peer and authoritative pressures are stronger this way

[comment]No letting the secrets of the glorious revolution out in public!
[comment]Anyone who has volunteered for other campaigns: Is this standard procedure?
[comment]Would they sue everyone?  Kind of sounds like transparency.  When the angry and violent are part of a campaign and no-one fires them, everyone gets an NDA.  Don’t want to embarrass Bernie with transparency when he’s trying to be President.

[comment]As a democrat, im still in the #believeher crowd. This whole "blue no matter who" campaign is total horseshit.
[comment]He DID hear that she liked him, maybe that's it
[comment]I don’t know if I believe her. 

There’s been some anecdotal evidence so far: the Larry King call, her neighbor/friend saying she told her about it back in the 90s. Why not come forward sooner though? A perpetual cry of the critics of accusers. 

With the current evidence it’s 50/50 she’s lying or she’s not. But that’s not what’s bugging me 

What’s bugging me is the absolute void of media coverage. The most significant coverage we’ve gotten was Google Play store removing the episode of Larry King with the call. I read the Times, Journal, and Post daily, and I haven’t seen any front page stories about the accusation. I haven’t gotten any news bulletins about the accusation from anyone except fox. 

I’m not saying they have to believe her! But the fact they’re not covering it at all, when you damn well they would and have given other accusers against Republicans *constant* coverage, is telling.

[comment]Exactly.
[comment]I am a Democrat and I believe Tara Reade
[comment]The problem here is not so much the acussation, but the sheer amount of other evidence that gives tremendous credibility to the accusation.  Those hundreds of videos where Joe is acting creepy with women of all ages definitely do not help his case. In contrast judge Kavanough have ha clean an respectable record void of inappropriate/ creepy stuff.
[comment]This pretty much proves the case that the “American divide”  is manufactured by the media in order to boost rage, which in turn boost network ratings for fake news channels and print.  Resulting in advertising revenue.  There is a financial incentive to sow anger.

<|startoftext|>[title]Study: 96% of Biologists Agree Life Begins at Fertilization
[selftext]https://politifeed.net/news/study-96-of-biologists-agree-life-begins-at-fertilization[comment]Yes it does
[comment]REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[comment]Life begins before fertilization. Both the egg and the sperm are living.

Are they sentient beings? No.
[comment]20 years ago, 100% of people agreed as well. This is a generational thing. People are more ignorant today than ever.
[comment]The sad thing is that most know it’s starts at fertilization, but still support abortion...
[comment]WOW 96% of scientists agree that climate change...oops...I mean...life begins at conception.
[comment]Here's the actual study.  Chapter 5 is the relevant section.  The questions asked start on page 240.  It's an interesting read.
https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/1883

What the headline alludes to is that 96% of respondents agreed with one or more of the following statements:

1. Implicit Statement: “The end product of mammalian fertilization is a fertilized egg (‘zygote’), a new mammalian organism in the first stage of its species’ life cycle with its species’ genome.”
2. Implicit Statement: “The development of a mammal begins with fertilization, a process by which the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.”
3. Implicit Statement: “A mammal's life begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete unites with a female gamete to form a single cell called a zygote.”
4. Explicit Statement: “In developmental biology, fertilization marks the beginning of a human's life since that process produces an organism with a human genome that has begun to develop in the first stage of the human life cycle.”
5. Explicit Statement: “From a biological perspective, a zygote that has a human genome is a human because it is a human organism developing in the earliest stage of the human life cycle.”

Statement 5 was the most contentious of these statements.  It was affirmed by 69% of respondents, and rejected by 31%.

85% of the respondents were pro-choice, and 15% pro-life.
[comment]Here is the thing, the Abortionists dont listen to sicence, they only listen to politcians that support their beliefs.
[comment]Keep your evangelical bs out of government it's the same shit as sharia law
[comment]So with your logic the day after pill is murder?  That’s an asinine statement.  Besides scientists all agree that life came from the Big Bang so does this mean we quote science only when it fits our narrative?
[comment]I am not a republican or even a conservative in the slightest, but I agree that abortion should be illegal and is immoral, as the fetus cannot consent. This issue should not be as partisan as it is.
[comment]When does life without the boot heel of a government agent begin?
[comment]I’m from the UK and just recently Northern Ireland have passed a law that makes it legal to have an abortion up to 28 weeks. That basically means that a baby that is touching 7 months old can now be legally aborted. I think that’s awful but there’s nothing you can do. You just have to accept it at this point because the progressives always get their way. I can understand the reasoning for abortion when the baby is in its very early stages but when it’s touching 7 months old I don’t see how you can justify it unless the baby or mother’s health is seriously compromised.
[comment]I'm ok, not being ok with killing babies of any species.
[comment]Abortion is simply a selfish act in almost every case,  I’ve heard women say if they had a baby that they couldn’t afford X, Y, and Z. Well you shouldn’t have taken the risk of having sex and not willing to have a child, my mother is in her fifties and just had another child that wasn’t planned on, we love him and we never considered an abortion because even if we aren’t in the safest place financially my family is ready to take on another child to give them the best in life.

An argument I see is that it isn’t the fathers choice because he doesn’t carry it for 9 months.  That’s BS, the father and the mother working together is the only way a child is born so leaving everything up to the mother after they have sex is just the most horse shit excuse I’ve seen, women have gotten abortions without telling there husbands because they just don’t want to take care of it.  

What if the father was okay with having another child? It’s his kid as well, is it not?  There are plenty of single fathers out there that took the child because the mother wasn’t willing to stay and care for it.
[comment]99% of biologists agree there ARE ONLY 2 FLAMING GENDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
[comment]People no longer give a shit because its not convenient. I remember having an argument with a dude who tried to make it an autonomy argument, but he completely missed the point that parents have a duty of care.
[comment]Here’s the big one I can’t understand:

Scientists are now doing the In Vitro Fertilization with genetic screening of embryos to choose the gender or likeliness to have blue eyes, etc. And they talk how much they care about the embryo and how magical all of this is. 

Then just as ready to kill that amazing thing at 9 months. 

Scientists see the beginning of life amazing and see all the DNA code and unique information in each one. Work so hard to make life happen and then work so hard to make sure they can kill them just as easy.
[comment]x% of scientist say what the left wants about climate change, then it's "settled science."  &gt;x% of scientists say life begins at fertilization and the left grows another head and shouts everybody down.  

Just goes to prove one thing.  The left doesn't know anything about or care anything about actual science.  Don't ever let them tell you otherwise.

[comment]I never knew Nancy Pelosi could look so good. This is brilliant. I'm definitely doing this next year. Wait what did I say. I want have to next year because the republicans are going to control the house and the senate and the presidency. Know anything will be CA nancy doing a sitting in the seat crying like a bit
[comment]😂
[comment]Ah flannel censorship.
[comment]Wait I saw this same post a year ago
[comment]Lmfaoooooo
[comment]He missed the best parts tho.  Watching Nancy was more entertaining than the speech.
[comment]LOL - That's awesome.
[comment]How dare he cover the Right side of the tv
[comment]I was pleased to watch her have to listen to all the accomplishments.  When Nancy is unhappy, I'm happy.
[comment]Your dad sucks hope he dies
[comment]Missed some fine comedy with her covered
[comment]Hahahaha!
[comment]The Democrats couldnt have looked more against the American people then last night. Not clapping/celebrating for the successes Americans are experiencing just because a democrat isn't president blows my mind
[comment]I for one am so glad she ripped up the speech at the end. Many people watching that will instinctively know it demonstrates unbridled hatred, and they won't want any part of it.
[comment]Unfortunately her rage filled face is now burned into the cloth, like a stretched out version of the Sudarium
[comment]Someone needs to tell peloski, the KKK want their sheets back
[comment]How was he able to see Nancy and her disgusting Baby Jane lipstick mutter drunkenly to herself
[comment]Hahahah I couldn’t stand viewing that vile creature! She will be impeached for destroying the state of union!
[comment]It’s funny watching her act like a spoiled brat
[comment]I should have done the same. She was so damn annoying to watch.
[comment]I like your dad.
[comment]Can I be your new step mom lol
[comment]Can I buy the TV?
[comment]Anything, anything to not see her face!
[comment]Outstanding move

[selftext]https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2020/03/22/pelosi-and-schumer-block-1-6-trillion-emergency-economic-funds-dow-futures-collapse/[comment]Dumb cnut. Her time is coming, grim reaper is on her tail. The dementia is gaining.
[comment]Hope Trump vocally eviscerates them in his press briefings and via Twitter. The country needs to know that while his administration is trying to save lives, and they were in a bipartisan way toward a common cause, Pelosi and Schumer are playing politics out of spite and refusal to do anything that would appear as a win for the Trump administration. Only a couple months ago was she ripping up his SOTU speech and handing out novelty impeachment pens.
[comment]Where’s the disagreement? Why can’t the politicians put us before their own interest.
[comment]We're in a war against the virus and Pelosi and Schumer are on the enemy's side.
[comment]It's in the dems best interest to sink the economy before November to help Joe Biden.
[comment]The Dems have disgustingly politicized this crisis from day one all the while claiming we must all work together. Is middle America and the independents sick of their hypocrisy yet? What does it take? A video of Schniff cutting the throats of republican congressmen who may have contracted COVID-19 claiming he is just a compassionate caregiver performing euthanasia so they won’t have to suffer. Will that convince them?
[comment]They finally get the recession they've been praying for
[comment]Try her for treason and hang the bitch
[comment]They want to spend a dollar to Get the CEOs authority to enact their policy.
[comment]Man, this just shows me how problematic our political are right now.  Even in a crisis they can't work together.

In case anyone was wondering this is what the Democrats were against in the bill.

"Democrats say the language would allow for corporations to keep bailout money while still firing workers, that the bailout money would have virtually no restraints and that there are very weak stock buyback restrictions."

"A senior Democratic aide told NBC News that Democrats are concerned that the bill lacks specific provisions to protect people from evictions, foreclosure or forbearance and that it would allow for only three months of unemployment insurance."
[comment]The Democratic Party has hit rock bottom. In years past, while Dems and Republicans had their differences, they were able to work together and put politics aside on major issues for the American people.

Pelosi and Schumer are easily the worst leaders the Dems have ever had in DC.

Latest Action:	Senate - 03/22/2020 Motion by Senator McConnell to reconsider the vote by which cloture on the motion to proceed to the measure was not invoked (Record Vote No. 77) entered in Senate.

This is the bill (47-47 vote) that was blocked in the senate. No reporter mentions or links the actual bill in their “article”.  Why is this a bill that is over a year old and only has to do with employer insuance tax relief?

[comment]This just proves what alot of folks have been saying....the Dems don't care whether or not the country fails.  They just want rid of Trump.  There is no "dealing" with a group like this.  Failure plays into their hands and they can get a "socialist utopia" they dream of.
[comment]How are you so sure that the corporations who employ Americans will spend the money in our best interest? There is a clear argument against this bill saying that corporations can still still lay off employees while taking bailout money. It’s being called a slush fund because they are loose rules on how it’s spent. I’m wary of that sort of thing, aren’t you?
[comment]Democrats are f\*\*king a\*\*holes.
[comment]Sadness and more sadness as self-serving agendas take precedence over the wellbeing of the American people.  So many more will struggle and suffer as a result of this purely political chess move.
[comment]I can't believe people are not outraged that the democrats are stalling a bill that would help the people in our country. I hope the dem voters see that politicians hate for our president is stronger than their love for OUR country.
[comment]dems who salivate over government funding block money... they’re off the wall
[comment]Dems are hung up on the 500b bailout of companies at discretion of treasury dept and not disclosing recipients for 6 months. Honestly, just give them that point. No reason why bailoit recipients have to be a secret
[comment]Are most people actually republicans here... because it seems like the majority finally understand the Dem position on this... and agree?
[comment]I actually cannot believe how petty the dems just acted. They dont get the spotlight so they shoot down a bill that will actually help millions of people? If you dont like it that much then maybe make another bill after this one is in so that we can help the goddamn people who cant work and pay for food and rent.this was absolutely childish of the democratic side of the Senate. I am incredibly disappointed.
[comment]Democrats high fiving each other at the prospect of damaging the US economy.

Typical Dems—they hope the dishonest media will cover for them again.
[comment]These Dems are the equivalent of Nero play the violin while Rome burns. Of course, that was only myth, but the metaphor works.
Rampant asshatery, I tell you.
By the way, they will be responsible for a lot of added pain to all of us.
[comment]The libs will block aide at every turn.. those that die will become registered Democrats. Talk about a shit deal, die from a virus then worse you end up voting democrat.
[comment]Could it be for want of spending in a different way? Such as through worker relief and Healthcare rather than bailing out big businesses?
[comment]They had no problem bailing out the auto industry or the corrupt banks in 2008.
[comment]Well the Dow Future is up big currently...
[comment]Now Pelosi adds billions of $ to new corona virus bill that adds $ for arts? Green new deal? And a bunch of other sxxt unrelated to coronavirus. If she can get it passed , which she can’t, she looks good. If it fails she wastes more time, the virus takes it toll and she makes Trump look worse. What a cold hearted witch. Let people die so Dems can have a better chance in president election. How is she not in jail for murder?

<|startoftext|>[title]Elizabeth Warren confronted by Iowa dad over student loan plan, saying people paying for tuition would get 'screwed'
[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-confronted-iowa-dad[comment]He is absolutely right. Hard working parents and students have been successfully paying for college and starting their lives soundly for years. This inane proposal does nothing except tax the smart to pay for the lazy
[comment]I paid my way thru school. It took longer, but I got it done. I know exactly how this dad feels.
[comment]My moderately liberal friends who've already completed their degrees even agree with this father.
[comment]A principle the Dems want to propagate is the devolution of morals and standards...like paying your own way. The dad is shocked, but why? This is the Dem plan for everything.
[comment]How do people defend this, whats the argument?
[comment]Its always funny to see the ones who complain about paying back their student loans.  

Them:  "I've got a PHD from the Ivy League and I can only find this job as a barista I'm drowning in $300k in student loans."

Me:  "Oh, that is terrible I'm so sorry to hear that!  What was your thesis on?"

Them:  "The inerpretation of 16th century lesbian poetry's impact on the modern patriarchy"

Me:  "You know what, when I said I'm sorry to hear that... I take it back."

Them:  "FASCSTI ASSHOLE!!!"

Me:  "You know, for going to an Ivy League school one would think you were smart enough to understand that you actually have to have a job that can pay off the money you borrowed to get that degree.  I mean I just went to 2 years of community college and then 3 at the university and I'm making 6 figures... Can I have my coffee now?"
[comment]They’re always talking about forgiving the loans... if student loans are so horrible, why keep issuing them? Shouldn’t that be step one?
[comment]I love this song
[comment]I’m a little mixed on this. I am pro accountability, but I do think schools have unfairly targeted targeted kids and sold bs degrees (lib art degrees with no ROI). I really wish institutions were held more accountable and not taxpayers
[comment]She really is a complete moron. Can’t believe people take her or any of those wackjob candidates seriously
[comment]Great, now do Bernie. These plans are stupid.
[comment]Is this like a Joe the Plumber situation, where "Iowa Dad" is actually a political operative? Because I can promise you there are very few people out there who are stupid/selfish enough to actually think their high tuition bills were acceptable and if they had to deal with them, fuck everyone else.
[comment]I do get this dad. We saved and saved, while our two kids were young, putting monthly amounts into a 529 savings plan.  They worked their butts off in HS, getting those grades for academic scholarships, and good ACT/SAT scores, worked PT jobs, and went to state colleges. They both also worked PT jobs on campus and then their summer jobs. They both graduated with no debt. Both have great jobs and our older son, 26, just bought his first home. With all of this, what horrifies me is the increasing cost of tuition. It seems to be artificially inflated because these colleges and universities know they can get piles of cash from students going to school on loans. I have a hard time believing the cost of educating a student for one semester can possibly be 10K-20K, (not including room and board).
[comment]Warren makes more Republicans everyday...
[comment]In her defense, leftists screw everyone over, then tell you how much they are helping you.  They just need a little more to make the previous screwing better.
[comment]That’s exactly what my wife’s parents — both blue collar workers — did for her. Her one sister went military so they had the money they’d saved for both her and my wife ready to go for when she got to school. She went to a smaller, local college that wasn’t an arm and a leg and it was basically all paid for. My wife even worked to supplement the stuff they wouldn’t pay for (food, rent, etc.). Her parents had saved enough for all but about $10,000 of her education and they paid off her student loans for that, just as they’d promised.
[comment]Such a selfish take. So things can never get better for the next generation, because of what the previous generation went though?
[comment]It's not only that.  If the government comes in and makes college free it's going to make it less relevant.  Those who went to school and worked hard to earn a degree in something relevant are going to be flooded out by a bunch of people studying worthless majors. They are only there because its free and it's the next step.  It will just become high school 2.0.  If I had to guess it would also lower in quality/standards and thus people coming out would be less prepared for the real world.

[comment]US Constitution, Article 1, section 7:

&gt; All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives

Warren:

&gt; Warren has said she would pay for the plan, estimated to cost $640 billion, with a 2 percent "wealth tax" on individuals earning greater than $50 million.

&gt; She even said she'd do so on her first day in the White House, and **bypass Congress if necessary.** (emp mine)

&gt; she would act **without waiting for Congress** because the Secretary of Education can “use its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs.” (emp mine)

Am I in a weird timeline where we are currently watching the Senate snore through an impeachment process of a quite flimsy interpretation of what the president can or cannot do with foreign policy while a presidential candidate (who is currently sitting in judgement of her political rival) campaigns on violating the constitution "day 1"?

As an aside, I cannot understand why republicans are not hitting back on the dem line that Trump was working to get a foreign government to interfere with the statement that impeachment is a tool to a, interfere through propaganda, and b, to allow Trump's political rivals an opportunity to vote him off the ballot and not have to face him in November.
[comment]"This was difficult for me and it should be difficult for everyone else too."
[comment]I'm guessing everyone here is upper middle class if not in the top 10 or 15 percent, you can all afford to go to college without incurring 100s of thousands of dollars of debt.

<|startoftext|>[title]I was a Democrat and Bernie supporter
[selftext]And while I ethically agree with the idea of saving lives from off of the streets through providing healthcare for everybody, and with college tuition being massively lowered, I realized that this is all deeper than red vs blue, and a Republic is what our country needs, and Trump’s cabinet is far and away the greatest team to lead this Republic to our greatness. I used to think “make America great again” was a derogatory and hateful phrase: that’s how bad they get you. Speaking as a freshly converted democrat-to-republican, I ask to give some time for other Democrats to discover the corruption occurring. For many democrats at the ground level are necessary, as progress and tradition both have their place, but they don’t know yet that they are being straight up lied to.[comment]Just need to open their eyes and their minds instead of blindly following the party line.

I'm not saying it's his fault, but that he was totally inept and incompetent when it came time to actually do stuff. He's a reactive politician, not a proactive one. Hindsight is 2020, quite literally this time.

[comment]Same. I used to be a full on democratic supporter, blinded by their "political correctness" they push using young liberals. Then I realized that there were so many loopholes in that ideal utopian thought of political correctness. Then i started to really look up to their policies or promises they have made, and what they are doing now. And i really need to say the whole pc thing is just blinding people, especially people around my age.
[comment]I was also a Bernie supporter back in 2016. Like OP stated I too like the idea of lowering the expense to obtain a college degree, improving our healthcare system etc. but a real solution isn’t as simple as “taxing the billionaires”. I wasn’t sure if I was a Democrat or a Republican back then, but what I’ve observed from the DNC and how the last 4 years have unfolded I know for certain I cannot align myself with the Democratic Party. The party leadership is not rational and they continually lie about everything. Glad you were able to observe what’s happening and most of all I’m glad you’re able to think for yourself, OP
[comment]I don't agree with "government paid" healthcare for all.  What I would support is a healthcare savings plan in which you can voluntarily set aside a percentage of income tax free in an HSA.  The money rolls over year after year.  It is spent on healthcare costs only again tax free.  Upon your death, money goes to designated next of kin and is taxed as income.  No need for general medical insurance, just catastrophic.
[comment]Welcome to the team! I’m from north jersey too!
[comment]I highly recommend reading up on conservatism and what that means. Look up Freidrich Hayek, William F. Buckley, and George Will. I’m not trying to gate keep, but I think it’s important for people to understand what a group believes in before they join it. Based on your comments, you seem to be switching sides based on some conspiracy theories and “corruption,” not actually political philosophy. To me, this seem analogous to someone switching from Judaism to Christianity because they found out “the Jews killed Jesus,” but they don’t know anything else about Christianity.
[comment]I do hope you realize that things are far from perfect on this side as well. There is corruption on both sides, but conservatives stand for independence, freedom and all People. 
Welcome, we are glad you are here.
[comment]Lmao you were a bernie supporter who identified as a democrat? most bernie supporters i know can’t stand the Democratic party
[comment]There's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. As far as college tuition. The answer isn't to lay the burden on tax otters to pay off other peoples school loans. The answer is to force colleges to charge fair tuition and lower it substantially.  One way to do it is for the government to limit the amount they lend for school loans. Cap it at $12k/year. Colleges will have to adjust or have empty classes. 
As far as Healthcare for all. It never works. We had a better system before Obamacare.  Everybody that worked had decent insurance through their employer. Though that didn't could go to various county hospitals that didn't charge. I live near Chicago. We have Cook County hospital. They provide service to anybody, no charge. Tax payers cover it. You cant raise taxes on the middle class to 80% to cover all the costs for lazy government leeches. Thats what Bernie would have done.
[comment]I am all for people getting healthcare and being able to afford college. But nothing in this world is free. If you want it for free, someone else has to go to work to pay for it. No amount of playing the victim can change that. Everyone has to work for their needs to be met.
[comment]You like single payer? You like college free for all? We have room for you in the Republican Party. If you want activist government, no problem. Do it at the state level. But for the hardcore Left call Republicans racist for talking about Federalism.

[comment]That is just sad. I can't even come up with anything more.
[comment]I dislike articles that misrepresent polls like this.

&gt;The poll asked 1,000 college students: How proud are you to be an American: very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud, or not at all proud?


&gt;Among the middle, 24 percent of Republican college students, 58 percent of independents, and 69 percent of Democratic college students said they are either moderately or only a little proud to be an American.

• Indiana University: Seems kinda silly to be proud about something I had zero control over.

• University of Houston: I’m glad to be an American, but I’m definitely not proud.

• Cal State San Marcos: America is the only country that matters.

• Notre Dame: Grateful? Yes. I don’t think pride is the correct emotion.

Much different than “republicans love America, democrats hate America” as the title implies.
[comment]They should leave then.
[comment]Biased domain haha. That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. Breitbart is trash. This is an absurd article that probably wasn't even based off a real poll.

[comment]I'm the son of immigrant parents and I love being american. I have visited both of my parents home countries (I'm asian) and would not trade places to live in either one. Even some of our crappiest universities are top 100 in the world (my school). That's a thing people never talk about. How unusual is it that the US has so many nationally renowned universities when most countries have only one or two. We lead in scientific discoveries and innovation.  Any industry you wish to work in it's hard to argue that the US is not a prime place to find a job for that industry. Some of the crappiest houses I've seen in the US is league's better than the crumbling unsafe houses I've seen visiting other countries. My dad worked his ass off and succeeded in the land of opportunity and is able to support all his relatives and my mothers back in their home countries. You are rewarded in the US for the amount of hard work you put in and I cannot say the same for other countries.

[comment]They're traitors to their country
[comment]I have been to many countries in the last 20 years.

I always talk withfolks in bars and restaurants and in conferences and I can tell you that the opinions of foreigners have dramatically changed in the last few years.

The overwhelming majority of people I have talked to said two things about electing trump:

1. Have you all lost your minds? This was almost *every person I spoke with* when they realized I was American.

2. He isgoing to try to become a dictator and we *know* dictators. This was said in many different waysbutitall boiled down to the same set of words.

So no, right now, I am NOT proud to be an American. This situation makes me angry. And it should make EVERYONE angry. Our country was founded on the idea that monarchy is an invalid government structure and that demagogues have no place in leadership. 

We have a man in the white house who thinks he should be king. We have the world telling us we are out of our minds. 

How can anyone be "proud" of that???

PUBLIC HEALTH


This virus is circulating in our community. And while we know of 110 positive test results, we also know there are likely many more that have gone untested. Because of that, we really urge everyone to act as those the virus could be anywhere and take the appropriate precautions – staying home except for essential trips, keeping 6 feet from others when in public, washing hands, not touching your face with unwashed hands, disinfecting high-touch surface and objects, etc.
[comment]Yeah but the media is pumping out fake news and lies against him just about everyday. The Lib media is absolutely disgusting they are doing the same as the Nazis did to the German people in WWII, nothing but propaganda.
[comment]Lol, I thought the title said Doctor. I was like, yeah no shit. Otherwise he would be President Doctor Trump. 

He is far from a dictator as well. Him fighting for strong states rights throughout this ordeal proves it tenfold.
[comment]Correct.  It shows he is incompetent
[comment]This is the same man that wanted to open businesses and risk people’s lives so his businesses could start making money again and  now you’re applauding him? Really? Cmon

Or... are you taking about when he referred to the virus as a hoax?
[comment]Congrats? He may not be a dictator but he's stupid. He tried to open the country back up by Easter and immediately every single scientist in the entire country was like wait....NO. How can he be so out of touch?
[comment]Why would he be a dictator?
[comment]This whole sub is a cult.
[comment]Genuinely curious, will the GOP support giving pregnant women $2,400 instead of $1,200? You know, seeing as how the unborn baby is a living human and all, they are actually two people according to the GOP. Or do unborn babies only count as living humans when it fits into your religious agenda? Asking for a friend 👀
[comment]Yeah all those dead people should stop freaking out about it! Haven't they seen the markets?!
[comment]You all are weak, cowardly fools.

Your time is nigh.
[comment]What a high bar to reach for as the US president "not a dictator." Now we can all go home, and whatayaknow, already there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Adam Schiff Has Crossed a Line: He's Obtained Phone Records of Devin Nunes, Nunes' Aide, Rudy Giuliani and John Solomon

[comment]This is really disturbing.  Schiff has now resorted to violating 4th Amendment rights of his political opposition.  These records are referenced in the report but weren't obtained by a lawful subpoena.  And now you've got Democrats threatening a Republican Congressman to "lawyer up."

Democrats are not principled opposition, folks.  They are vile, evil people that have organized themselves into a political mafia.  They actively seek to hurt and destroy anyone who disagrees with their agenda, and unless a silent majority in the party manages to rise up and squash these worms occupying the party leadership positions, they are beyond redemption.
[comment]Lol, you guys are pathetic.
[comment]&gt;["Obtained"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena)
[comment]Schiff4brains needs to be introduced to a Louisville slugger
[comment]This is crazy.  I mean if anyone associated with President Trump or his administration had been investigated or indicted for wrongdoing, or let alone convicted of crime, then maybe there's be a good reason to look into all this seemingly normal activity by the President's personal lawyer in a foreign country.

But obviously Rudy is not being investigated by the FBI, it's perfectly normal for the President's personal lawyer to go to foreign countries and engage in serious negotiations about weapons and money, Rudy is not being investigated by his former department, and Roger Stone and Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos have been acquitted of all charges.

Oh and the Republican Senate did not, I repeat did not conclude after a thorough investigation that Russia (not Ukraine) ran a military intelligence operation to sway our election toward President Trump.

So what's all this fuss?
[comment]This is hardcore gaslighting.
[comment]How dare Schiff do this, I don’t care if those phone calls had evidence of Trump wanting a swastika tattoo and starting the fifth reich, THIS IS WORSE!

[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/elizabeth-vaughn/2020/01/02/758773/[comment]Dammit no, that's what those morons want, to play the victim card.
[comment]They should impeach pelosi
[comment]So glad I voted for him: )
[comment]This can play out in 3 ways. 

1) The democrats will cry corruption and play the victim card as they always do

2) The left will wake up and ask why Pelosi delayed the AOI.

3) Pelosi will be forced to turn over the AOI and the real fun can begin.
[comment]The biggest irony, is that the Democrats (Pelosi in particular) have themselves are guilty of abuse of power (frivolous use of impeachment) and obstruction of congress (not releasing the articles of impeachment to the senate, thus obstructing them from carrying out the due process).  
I honestly don’t know why anyone would vote for them. Over the last 4 years, they’ve ignored the outcome of the election and now they’re trying to reverse it. That’s the type of behaviour you’d expect in a dictatorship. The Steele dossier and spying on Trump’s election campaign, should have been enough to reveal them as the authoritarian hypocrites that they are.
[comment]good for him, it’s time to put the shenanigans behind us and get back to basics.
[comment]It's time to end this side show and get on to the real business of running our government.

Either way, that was a painful 7 seconds to watch.

[comment]With his fake left eye.
[comment]This is hilarious and Biden is definitely moron. But we have seen Trump make similar errors in public forums, haven’t we?
[comment]I am not rooting for it and God forbid it happen but I would not be surprised if he had a stroke before the end of the election. He just seems discombobulated.

I'm not even sure Bernie would speak this line aloud. Might upset his comrades

[comment]Biden... a total creepy weirdo that slurs his words and forgets stone-written historical phrases and claims he can fix the big American problems when he's president (even though he's been in politics since 1968 and hasn't fixed any!)

Bernie ...the drooling bloodhound uttering old-fashioned commie crap and praising Cuba and Nicaragua... (MY apologies to the bloodhounds: you guys are cute and faithful and all the good stuff, the comparison is just about the drooling and the jawls).

[comment]Happening in the states too with these anti Semitic nutjobs in congress.
[comment]Who were the people? Who thought importing all the necessary hateful parts and poison pieces of the Middle East's wars and rumors of war and civil conflict turn out with anything other than burnt cathedrals, mass murder and mayhem.
[comment]Ah shit, here we go again
[comment]Wow I wonder who is responsible for that
[comment]Before you lecture the world you know. . .
[comment]I think it's time to take a page from the play book of the Jews and start compiling crimes against Whites.
[comment]Well then, let’s start dropping the bombs. First we nuke Dresden, we need to let these fuckers know we ain’t kidding this time. Shinzo and his imperialist expansions can get the bombs later too, if needed.
[comment]WW2 Part II?
[comment]It's the Palestinians.

[comment]WWII electric boogaloo 2
Seriously though let’s hope Germany drops some of it’s crazy freedom castrating legislation, and come to its senses before another hitler rises demanding those laws are taken out by force. Frick REAL nazis.
[comment]I blame this on Trump, racist wypipo, Israel, guns, Fox news and uhhhh.... Doja Cat for some reason.
[comment]"Hey I've seen this one!"
[comment]It is 1930's again boys!
[comment]Yo while we're dealing with the skinheads, lets import some more folks with anti-semitic views from the Middle East!
[comment]As a German I’m very confused by this. First of all there are barely any Jews left in Germany (most are of Eastern European decent) and secondly it say that there a bunch of neo nazis doing it. The only people in my community that are openly outspoken against Jews are my Muslims friends, I don’t know a single person that glorifies the nazis.
[comment]Now is this because the adf is getting bigger or because they're muslin population is much bigger? Curious
[comment]That was why Markel allowed the millions of muslims in to Germany, to finish Adolf’s job and to conquer Europe using the EU as a vehicle.
[comment]How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?
[comment]Pretty sure this story isn’t going to be covered by the MSM
[comment]What does the “biased domain” tag mean?
[comment]See? It's not just in America.
[comment]Are you really telling me why only 50% of crimes are solved on average magically antisemitic crimes have a rate of over 95% showing these are all far right? Antisemitic crimes are defined as far right. All unsolved cases are counted as far right. You are willfully ignoring reality to stay in your bubble. Don Quixote fighting windmills made of swastikas.
[comment]Antizionism, protesting against Israel, not judaism
[comment]Jews are responsible for the muzzie invasion of Europe, now it's coming back to bite them on the ass. And of course, the Jew controlled media makes it look like it's whites doing it, when it's not. And remember all the fake crimes that are done and reported by Jews!<|endoftext|>

But for the Democrat party, par for the course.
[comment]Yes, yes they do.
[comment]This is the hoax that the president was referring to - the dems and their media trying to capitalize on this by causing a panic and doing as much damage as they can to the economy.
[comment]"You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before." --Rahm Emanuel
[comment]They always make everything political. And it's never their fault. Even when it is, it's conservative/Republicans fault...
[comment]This Republican president literally put millions of lives at risk by announcing the crisis to be under control and nothing to worry about. Only to flip 24 hours later with the truth because those closest to him finally stood up and said he was being a jackass I needed to stop speaking out of the side of his face. You want to try to latch onto politicians doing what politicians do that’s fine but everything the Democrats are trying to do, is the result of a president who’s done nothing.
[comment]Maybe President Trump should have done a better job preparing our testing infrastructure in the 2 months he had to get ready for this threat? 

This is how democracy works, when you do a shitty job, which Trump has personally (Coronavirus is a hoax, I take no personal responsibility for the testing rules and regulations) you get hit for it. It’s a carrot and stick system, you get rewarded for good actions and held accountable for bad. 

Also, where was this spirit of bipartisanship when Obama was implementing his recovery plan? We’re Republicans being ‘bad Americans’ for criticizing him?

The Democrats are doing their job, pointing out the failures of the Trump administration. The real problem is that it took up until late this week for Trump to do his and publicly acknowledge this threat for the acute threat it poses.
[comment]While the Corona virus was spreading overseas the asshat Democrats were busy with their peach mints.  Nothing else mattered to them.
[comment]Wait until the soft debate tonight (new rules for protecting Biden). The politicizing of a pandemic to criticize the right. Honestly, I can't see Biden getting through this but we soon shall see.
[comment]It may be dangerous, but it doesn’t mean it is the end of the world. There have been pandemics like this before and guess what the world moved on.
[comment]This place is becoming just like r/politics.
[comment]So do Republicans.  They tried to sneak abortion restrictions and banning encryption into bills relating to the virus.  It's just politics as usual.
[comment]When did this sub become r/politics 2.0?
[comment]Didn't Trump try to buy the pharmaceutical company that has been closest to creating a vaccine so he can sell it for a profit? That sounds like a pretty big exploit of a crisis.
[comment]Trump went from saying that the virus was a democrat hoax to national emergency in one week. Do you have brain damage?
[comment]This is true, someone has to get them under control, they are terrifying people, closing schools, making online learning illegal where I live (because it is “not fair” to the kids without wifi), and closing all sorts of businesses (which shouldn’t be possible in a free country). They want millions to die and they also want the economy to tank, all of their other plans have failed. PLEASE STOP THEM, THEY ARE KILLING THE NATION! PLEASE! Actually please!<|endoftext|>

[comment]If I know a family member that can give haircuts, I would have long ago. As it is, I'm on my own and need the barber shops to re-open already. These rich folks have their own stylists on standby probably.
[comment]No I'm pretty and not a communist scumbag do as I say not as I do POS.
[comment]It’s because the stay-at-home orders aren’t there to protect people.

They’re there to hurt the economy and our president. This whole thing is a giant liberal scam that everybody is falling for
[comment]Did my first self attempt with the buzz clippers today.  Not great, not horrible.
[comment]Damn, fuckin hypocrites. Now they're somehow going to blame Trump for this somehow.
[comment]What did he "flow-be " break? WTF kinda hair style dies she have..

[comment]But that is how the Democrats will "get rid of Trump," despite losing the election.
[comment]If its vote by mail it will be a fraud fest.
[comment]This post is a joke.
[comment]I just don't understand this. Who is it that people don't trust? Is it the mailman, the (elected)supervisor of elections, each other? I would go to the polls to cast my vote but I'm not sure my parents would. Nobody should have to choose between perceived safety and our right to vote.
[comment]Polls by whom?
[comment]Brit here. We have it, it did.
[comment]The real issue is can a state do it securely and fairly. Ohio barely did it because they have 2 decades of vote by mail experience, with 20% of their voters already doing it.
New York has 1% that vote absentee and had no infrastructure set up, so they straight up cancelled their primary election.
[comment]1200 was the same size for this.... US population:~328.2 million....1200/328,200,000*100=.000365% was the percentage of the US population that took this survey.... and now represents 62% of Americans (203,484,000 people). Also 272/1200 people took this survey online, how hilariously ironic! Thanks for not reading before you post.
[comment]Having traveled extensively for work, I started voting absentee over 30 years ago. Fraud never crossed my mind. My ballot arrives in the mail, I fill it out, I send it in. I don't see how any effort to circumvent this, in a meaningful way, would occur.
[comment]And the other third knows it but just will not say it!
[comment]Public opinion polls are meaningless
[comment]not sure how it isn't 100%. 

Would phone in purchases of booze increase underage alcohol consumption?
[comment]Seriously?
[comment]I strongly believe that voting by mail would help prevent voter fraud. In fact I don’t think that there is any significant amount of voter fraud in this country. Hell you can barely get people to vote in the first place. Remember that committee that Kris Kobach ran, they disbanded because they didn’t find any evidence of voter fraud.<|endoftext|>

When you have mega corporations like these trying to politically influence elections its time to regulate them or terminate them.
[comment]The beauty of living in a free society is that you could simply choose to not use Twitter if you don't like it so much. It would be frustrating if Twitter were the only option for social media... Maybe someone should, I don't know, boycott it
[comment]Just delete your Twitter account.
[comment]100% agreed! 

That would put an end to all these disinformation campaigns, hate incitement, vicious and baseless accusations, fake news, blatant lies, doxing, etc. Social media gave a voice to many who needed to be heart, but also to MANY more who should never have been able to get to any kind of audience. They should be accountable for what they provide their platform as a tool.
[comment]Then don't use it, take your business elsewhere
[comment]The problem with Twitter and Social Media in general is that it gives everyone an equal platform to voice their opinions. The problem is not all opinions are equal and don’t deserve any platform with which to be heard.
[comment]To all those who are saying “dOnT uSe iT”. I believe this guy is trying to say, and I could be wrong, that there is an overall negative affect on society as a whole, costs outweigh benefits. And this problem won’t be reconciled if this singular user “sToPs UsInG TwiTtER” and goes “sOmEwHeRe ElSe”
[comment]Yeah but so are republicans so 🤷‍♀️
[comment]Yeah but that doesn’t mean we have the right to shut them down. Let people do what they want. Just hold yourself accountable to the values you place on others.
[comment]They are only as cancerous as the people who use them.
[comment]Social media is really a cancer that eats away your mental healthy slowly, try deleting Facebook, WhatsApp or any of the social media apps, think about how much more productive you will, I deleted WhatsApp a few months ago, Facebook a week ago. The whole Zuckerberg ecosystem is just bad and unhealthy, for example: Instagram is just an illusion and a bubble, people live in it and it eats away their life. Reddit too is bad mainly because you end up arguing with people who have no clue what the hell they're talking about.
[comment]Delete
[comment]Yeah, that's true, can't go on any social media with a bunch of you retards talking about coronoa hoax, 5g, and bitching about people calling out your limp dick leader for lying. Why don't you all fuck off from the internet?
[comment]I agree but also ironic when the republican president puts out so many tweets per day
[comment]Don’t use it then.
[comment]As much I can agree they are toxic at many times, they are the only platform for widespread conversation about American politics. Many republicans have come out and said they are cancerous because of censorship but do not understand that without these platforms there would simply be no platform for anyone do discuss and evolve their ideas.
[comment]Twitter should be shut down, they suck big time just like Jack.
[comment]He said as he posted on a social media site.
[comment]Hey Pelosi, Maxine, Crying Chuck, Biden, how proud are y’all of your voter base now?
[comment]Great article!
[comment]Media is an underlying cause of our divisiveness and hate.  Being in everyone’s homes on a nightly basis perpetuating hate, and lies against their opponents has brainwashed the entire country and has led to the situation we are in now.
[comment]Yeah no kidding. Wish we had arrived at that conclusion before it became an official policy tool of the state. It’s too easy for liberals to be validated by people with no stake in this country as they shout into the void.

I predict that his administration will resort to iron-fisted and poorly executed methods to exercise his agenda. Do we have any evidence that Bernie knows the first thing about executive power?

[comment]This is Russian Troll Trap garbage. Pumped out to cause division here in the USA.  Its wel documented that chaos and a weakened US government is Putins goal.

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/p7ynyacg3xh41.jpg[comment]Excellent article !!!  Hopefully the younger generations read this and understand what is at stake come November elections.
[comment]Amazing!!!
[comment]Another reason is high taxation on businesses causes failing businesses, which in turn causes the working class to lose their jobs, and then everybody is poor a great equalizer.
[comment]I get what this is saying, and I don't think anyone should get a free ride. This country was built on hard work and the people who work harder should get more reward. But what about people who work hard but still get a rough shake? Some people inherit great careers and wealth from great parents, but some other people also inherit nothing from shitty parents. I don't want handouts for those people, but it's unfair to say that a shitty life is entirely their fault because they don't work hard. I know plenty of people bringing in a lot of income for doing jack shit.

[comment]I’ve got to show this to a few people.
[comment]The next stages is where the administration steps in and says that they expect passing grades.  So the teacher grades on the curve and everyone gets a B no matter what.  It's a change from economics knowledge backed grades to fiat grades.  For a while, everything looks like it's working.  But before long the grade inflation catches up and people realize the grades are worthless.
[comment]I'm inclined not to believe this. The administration would have stepped in to make sure the students got the grade they earned fair and square.

[comment]I always see these socialist students say “It’s the best thing ever because it’ll make everything equal” but as soon as you ask if someone who didn’t study should get your grades, or it should be equalized, SUDDENLY, that’s not fair because “I worked for my grades and they didn’t”

For some reason this applies to money but in life, they want to work for the reward
[comment]Does anyone have any Insightful responses to why it’s so popular in the media? Like I read this article and it makes perfect sense but you have die hard Bernie fans who swear it will work.  Like thousands and thousands of them. 
Is there something we’re missing? How is one portion of the population so naive to its ravages? I just can’t wrap my mind around it

[comment]But the person at the top of the capitolist tree just makes the rest of the students do the work for an F while taking A* without having touched a book
[comment]In order for socialism to succeed, one would have to have great pride in ones country. That way, you’re suffering for the greater good and your work goes towards a country you believe in. However, Americans are now being taught to hate their own country, kneeling in front of the world and not just domestic sports like American football. For the other half of America who still believes in democracy, they wouldn’t be able to put forth the effort needed to succeed in a communist country.
[comment]The problem is every generation or so sees this shiny prize at the edge of the cliff and assumes that the reason socialism fails is that those stupid old people were just not advanced or smart enough to implement it properly. It is like the gun control experts assume that to end all violence and crime is to eliminate all guns. The real variable that disrupts the equation is human nature and free will. And try as they might to beat and slaughter it out of society the Nazis, Communist etc. could not achieve it. I liken it to that old myth about Lemmings. Every new generation goes bailing off the cliff without understanding their decision or anyway of turning back assuming “I am going to be the one that makes it”. But gravity thou art a heartless bitch. The US is the lemming at the top of the cliff selling paper wings and Mylar balloons. If the US falls to socialism is implemented in the US the world economic crash will produce a political and economic nightmare that we might not climb out of for 100 years. We are literally the last real bulwark between a totalitarian world and a free one. Don’t count on China if the US economy fails China falls quick, over half of their precarious economic stability is all US funded. Without the US dollar China will boil over into a billion near cannibals burning communist party members on open pyres.
[comment]Socialism and communism are not the same and its a false equivocation to discuss as such. It would be like saying capitalism/fascism. No one is suggesting the economic equivalent of this situation.
[comment]You know this is fake right?

[comment]Curious what his annual income is post Presidency and what steps he’s taken to secure it
[comment]Well he knows his endorsement could cause more devision, and by staying silent he plans to try a last minute push to counter trump. It’s a decent idea considering how Democrats are tearing eachother up atm.
[comment]I don't see what the big deal is here. Obama has too much influence here, he wants to let the voters speak. If he steps in now, it gives a huge bump to whoever he endorses. He will likely wait and then endorse and campaign for the nominee.
[comment]In his water front estate screaming about climate change
[comment]I saw someone call Obama a republican the other day on r/politics
[comment]An Obama endorsement would only hurt Democrats.

He could shoot his load early and endorse Joe. Obama alienates the Bernie people and hurts the Dems. He alienated the Bernie supporters and a good chunk vote for Trump. If Joe loses, the “Bernie Would’ve Won” people blame Obama.

If Obama endorses Bernie, the dem establishment and Joe collapse and moderate Dems don’t vote or vote for trump.

Obama’s best move is to wait to for Joe to pick a VP , and if that VP is super popular and it looks like Joe has an edge, Obama comes in to push Joe PVE the line.

[comment]Obama is part of the movement toward Socialism and he's working in the background.
[comment]Obama doesn't give a shit about any of that. He just wanted to the pay day of being the president and he's cashed in on that like no other. The party falling to shit means nothing because Trump already destroyed any political legacy he was ever going to have and since it doesn't benefit him he just doesn't care. He'd rather be making absurd money helping Netflix come up with some half baked TV show.
[comment]Obama will walk up wearing a MAGA hat and say that he purposely sabotaged the Democratic party™ to pave the way for Trump, then he will jump onto the Trump steamroller alongside the Republicans as it flattens everything in its path.

[comment]Honestly I don't mind Obama staying out of it.

Former presidents should wait until a nominees pick and then get behind them
[comment]The dems have been supporting the “middle class” as their platform, but truthfully the last 25 decades of democrats haven’t really represented the middle class. Just like the republicans, they bend over for lobby money.

Hence, the evolution of the democratic class will naturally converge with a candidate that actually supports the middle class. Calling it socialism is just as stupid as calling trump a nazi. Regardless, his principles undermine our values of capitalism for sure which is why I’m so doubtful.

But this started when dems began accepting lobby money during the Clinton era. They kept losing elections because money bought republicans over and over again. 3 decades later, Democrats are trying to undue that one decision.

Quite unfortunate, you’re big business bitch now. You don’t represent the middle class, how can you?

So shut the fuck up about this socialism shit. I feel for these people, although I don’t agree with their philosophies

[comment]The rest of society doing well apparently sucks to Mark.
[comment]I actually don’t completely disagree with Zuckerberg or Warren on this particular subject. 

It’s very much a two way street. Facebook has clearly, as Warren stated in her tweet, crossed the line into a very manipulative and corrupt business. Many tech companies have and Google is the one we should be most scared of hands down.

The issue is our government should really not be getting that deeply involved with a normal business. It could just as easily be a cover for both republicans and democrats to try and take a grip on a vein of social power like Facebook, like they already have with journalism.

Ideally it should be the populace who see corruption in a business and stop investing into their product. Move to a different company; however in the case of big tech you have a lot of people too addicted to change. 

Idk honestly all around it’s a really sticky situation and it doesn’t seem like it has an outcome that is fair.

"Wallstreet fears an Elizabeth Warren presidency" - The Hill

"Warren has put the fear of god into Wallstreet" - Axios

"Elizabeth Warren 2020 has Wallstreet very angry" - Vox 

"Wallstreet is scared of Elizabeth Warren" - CNBC 

Elizabeth "Capitalist To My Bones" Warren poses no threat to this immoral/rigged system. It's all fake. A fluke to prevent an actual reformist from being elected. The purpose of this manufactured bullshit is to sway politically illiterate "progressive" voters towards supporting Warren over the only actual candidate the wealthy fear. I don't even have to say his name. You already know. 

The 1% wouldn't tell voters who to vote for if they want to stick it to the 1%. That's why Warren gets all the attention from the mainstream propaganda machine while Voldemort's name is rarely mentioned unless it's negative news. 🌹

everything else less than 5%.

Honestly I consider myself mostly libertarian. The problem is USA libertarians have no idea where they are standing. Apparently for them anything the government does makes you less libertarian, apparently, for USA  ''libertarians'', Hayek, Mises, Locke, Mill ( some of the biggest and most important libertarians in history ) and to some extent even Rothbard ( the most extremist pro liberty of the bunch )  are not libertarian enough, but for some of them apparently Bernie IS a libertarian.

The USA Libertarian Party is a joke , which is sad, as I consider myself a libertarian.

[comment]When I heard Dinesh layout the facts about the Democratic party being the slave holders of the antebellum, and then observe today's Black Americans' blind loyalty to that system, the irony is too irresistible to spark laughter while simultaneously invoking sympathy.

[comment]Welcome friends :)
[comment]When I truly consider my peers at work, my colleagues, the people I interact with daily and the varied ethnicities from which they come. The intersection between their values and my conservative values is consistent. I feel that conservative value of family, the preservation of the family unit is a thread that weaves through every ethnicity of all Americans.

The easiest way to prove that Republicans support those families, is by providing the framework and economic conditions so that each family might provide for itself the kind of life each chooses to enjoy. One not burdened by oppressive regulation or by systemic goverment oppression.

The message and actions Republicans should be moving forward with, is that Republicans are the ones removing the barriers and obstacles to their success. That the results of these actions will be strengthening the bonds of their communities, so not only will their families thrive, but so we all might be in a position to aid our communities and neighbors.

[comment]https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DWam9FSRvGI glad to see all the recognition black conservatives deserve
[comment]I'll believe it when I see it.  The Left hooked blacks on welfare and are seeking to do the same with Hispanics.  However, getting disparate groups to serve the same role means they compete.  The Left's plan was to unite them in hatred of white people.  The media can only conjure up so many tales about racist rednecks and suburban gun owners.  That's not as near as the threat posed by Hispanics.  All the Left promises is continued importation of voters and expansion of their franchise.  Rather than meaning a bigger pie, it means sharing the slice that blacks used to have.  So there is a chance, but I'm not holding my breath.  People generally vote straight ticket out of habit.  Thus this reality might show up in voting as a 70-30 split rather than a 90-10 split rather than a flip.

[comment]Leftism is a mental illness, some of the symptoms include but are not limited to an extreme case of TDS, delusions, aggression, temper tantrums, etc

That's how it got this far
[comment]Biden was confusing official business that was in the interest of the United States (in conjunction with a group of other nations). His actions were not suspect and have nothing to do with Trumps actions. 

Trump asked a foreign nation to take action that was in his personal interest and used the power of his office to try and make this happen. 

Linking the two is a mental illness
[comment]Because three years of hyperbolic scandals cant be wrong. This is the narrative to reinforce delusional projections of Orange man bad.

He has governed way more conservative than expected setting historical figures of social progression but that doesent matter.

The media said he was bad day one so they cant lost their credibility and they have to reinforce the delusional farce that there is a crisis.

This is not a scandal. It is a new precedent of political attacks that will forever change how both parties conduct themselves. 

The Democrats overplayed their hand on this one and it will haunt them for the next decade.
[comment]I got to tell you guys, based on similar election we just had with left wokeness attacking blue and white collar workers in the UK we won with a massive landslide which put labour back for a decade. The Dems are going after the woke liberals and forgetting their place for Americans that give a shit.

Trump is gonna win it all 2020

[comment]Lock Biden and his son in the same cell!

[comment]Because theyre all corrupt and dont want the dominos to start falling
[comment]Because it was investigated and determined Biden did nothing wrong.

Dems: We're taking our ball and going home, we'll finish this after we recruit some more players...
[comment]This is the power of mass manipulation
[comment]The media.

In fact, I swear to god this is 100% true. This morning, this older guy I know very well from my gym was talking to me about the latest political news. He hates Trump, but every one of his reasons are based on "feelings" and when presented with facts, he goes back to feelings. "I think" "I heard" etc.

So today he tells me that Trump was in for quid pro quo with Ukraine. I asked him if he's ever seen the Biden video? He said he watches a lot of news, never seen it. WHAT?? So I showed him, he at first tried to twist it, and then a few minutes later he comes back over to me "I changed my mind on Biden, and I need to look into this more".. well yeah, your news is giving you what they think you need to see, not what you need to see
[comment]Because the press and the House work for the Democrats, and whatever principles the Democrats claim, their first and only true principle is loyalty to their team.

[comment]He may be our president but now he will go down in history as a bad one. He may not be getting kicked out of office but he is still impeached and we have to accept that
[comment]All this has accomplished is stronger party divides through the country and fired up Trump supporters. He is gonna ride this into re-election and it's gonna be a blast to watch.
[comment]Literally no one is denying he is still the president. He doesnt deserve to be, and you shouldnt sacrifice your humanity to appease the cult of personality.

That's how you sound.
[comment]Everyone in here is confirmation how easy it was for the russians to feed their talking points. Most gullible group of people since Christian's. Oh wait.
[comment]You know you can be a republican and also not support trump...right?
[comment]There is going to be a huge voter turnout for trump in 2020. Lots of angry motivated voters.
[comment]Why are the liberals attacking our subreddit. Go back to Soviet Russia liberals, you commie fags.
[comment]love this!
[comment]I have never voted in my life. Never follow politics. I would say I'm an independent person when it comes to political issues. I will register to vote in 2020 for Trump. After doing my own research and fact checking it appears the Democrats don't care about facts.
[comment]Democrats arent really against abuse of power. They are against people using their power to investigate their people. When Obama, the FBI, the DOJ, Adam Schiff abuse their power it is justified.  When Trump tries to investigate Biden for his abuse of power, that suddenly is a crime and an abuse of power.
[comment]I'd like to take a moment to thank all those Democrats that endorsed the President's re- election in 2020 on their way out the door.
[comment]TRUMP 2020!!! Wooohooo!!!
[comment]Trump 2020! Nobody can stop this thunderstorm that is going to overtake America wreaking destruction and the justified hatred that it’s forefathers have sown. It is now the time to rise and be heard. We will not be ignored, fire is what we were born out of and fire is how we will die. 2020! Fire!
[comment]Why would multiple decorated veterans and foreign dignitaries testify under oath of wrongdoing? Sacrificing their careers. While nobody is willing to testify against them? Including POTUS. And saying it's a sham trial doesn't work. Your guys get to ask questions also. Hillary (not that I like her ass) testified for hours on Benghazi. Where's your witnesses? Also 0 indictments on her, but several for this shit show!
[comment]Now i can see why Trump called the Democrats "Do-Nothing-Democrats" because how can Congress solve any of your country's problems with one party only focusing to topple the other.
[comment]Ok, boomer
[comment]Only for a little while longer. Thank God
[comment]Technically by the letter of the law and Constitution, until the Dem's put forth the articles to the Senate and send forth their representatives and officially announce to the Senate the results, Trump is not impeached.  

The Democrats voted on it and it passed but it has to go to the Senate to become official, them holding onto it means it has not yet been recognized by the letter of the law.

[comment]Gotta start somewhere guys...
[comment]She doesn’t have to be the perfect eco warrior to represent the climate change movement. Almost nobody is actually net zero in pollution. Greta is far from net zero, but she does put in effort. I agree that the whole yacht thing was a ridiculous spectacle of show-boating (literally) and virtue signaling, but at least she’s trying to be environmentally conscious.

I don’t think you guys realize that your reactions are why she’s famous in the first place. She would have been unknown to the public, but mainstream media hit a gold mine when they realized that she triggers reactions from conservatives all around the world. There are thousands of prolific environmentalists that have contributed to science, technology, or have suffered a great deal in their efforts to be eco-friendly, but none of them are able to garner the controversy Greta gets. Thanks to you.
[comment]Honestly, you all need to stop making fun of her.  Making fun of a 16 year old is bad optics (it’s like making fun of a disabled person). I think most people get she’s  a 16 year old naive girl that lefty journalists (Time in particular) virtue signaled with like a handful of times.

[comment]Why are we giving so much attention to this kid?  There are far more comments on this thread in this sub than any other.   FFS.
[comment]The biggest issue I have with her “cause” is she chooses to attack organizations/nations who are already curbing emissions. The US and EU have decreased their CO2 emissions by 10% and 16% respectively since 2000. Meanwhile China has increased theirs by 220% and India has increased by 150%. Yet she won’t set foot there and make a peep. That to me, makes her a shit activist by any definition because she refuses to take her cause to places where it truly matters. UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders, hell even Greenpeace gets on the thick of shit to help and champion their causes. Greta just got her 15 min of fame and now she’ll fade into the distance. Probably go to college to Major in some business degree and end up working for BP or Exxon
[comment]The truth came out. Greta is a paid actress and has been making agenda films most of her life. Talk about a world full of suckers!!!!

[comment]I think a lot of Democrats should be investigated for their pro-illegal immigrant stance. It just doesn’t make any sense, and we’re the only country in the world where government representatives champion the rights of non-citizens over citizens.
[comment]Most people here illegally are still working. At least where I live, Central Valley California. Cut aid to the countries they come from and give to our workers and reinvest into bringing manufacturing back from overseas.
[comment]Give them a plane ticket to go back to their country and get the relief that is given there.
[comment]They need to ask the country of their origin for assistance.  They aren’t American citizens.
[comment]God forbid we show any sort of humanity to everybody in this country during a global pandemic
[comment]Dems like to refer to them as immigrants. Nope- they lost that designation as soon as they swam over the river and hopped the border. 100% illegal.

[comment]To be fair the guy he was talking to was kinda being a dick and trying to trip him up on purpose. The guy mentioned something and Biden clarifying ed wjat he was saying and they guy just kept bitching and aggravated Biden. Can’t get mad at him for having a reaction anyone else would when dealing with someone like that. 🤷‍♂️
[comment]More than anything else I think of him as a lifetime bully
[comment]One of these days, Uncle Joe is going to challenge the wrong gaborone and get handled. I can hope anyways.
[comment]Well... now I kinda want to vote for Biden.
[comment]Uncle Joe is unreal.
[comment]Which is different from “beat ‘em up, I’ll pay the legal fees (roughly)” how exactly?

If we’re gonna hate on Joe can we hate it on him for good faith reasons? I.e. ways he’s actually different from our president?
[comment]We really have no room to talk either. Trump isn’t any better at stuff like that and we know it. 

Watching Joe Biden want to pick fights is kinda interesting. His temper sets off randomly which is definitely not decency or dignified lol makes me worried he has some underlying condition... 

The democrats have definitely not been unified at all. It’s so unorganized. I find it hard to believe they have a shot to win unless they get their stuff together.
[comment]Wait I thought that was a meme. That's real?
[comment]Oh my God, you guys are such pussies. I don't like Biden, I vote be voting for him in November, but I have respect for anyone who challenges people to a fight over political differences. 


President Andrew Jackson used to duel people for less.  Was he indecent and undignified?  President Trump has a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office right now. If Jackson was undignified, I suppose Trump is also undignified.

Internet warriors are a cancer to any society. We lack the drive to fight for what we believe in. Political discourse would be significantly better if everyone who voiced an opinion we're fearful of getting punched in the face.
[comment]The main stream media didn't report the Michigan assault, so it didn't happen.

[comment]So if you are calling for decency and dignity(even though that’s not what your comment above says mind you), how is it not hypocritical when Trump neither acts decently or with dignity? Honest question. You can like or not like Trump, but I don’t think anyone would call him a decent man with a lot of dignity.

Hyped up to only be a massive dud, I’m not worried at all. If the testimony comes out to be true then I will reassess the situation but I have no faith in Democrats at all at this point.

Nunes stated that Ratcliffe destroyed Taylor’s testimony in about 90 seconds, I trust Nunes and Meadows much more then Democrats.

I watched CNN today(I had no choice) and they had a guest saying during Watergate the Democrat in charge made sure Republicans got whatever they wanted, more witnesses? Approved. More evidence? Approved. More testimonies? Approved. More cookies? Approved. 

It’s not happening here, and that’s why I have no trust. When the Republicans get what they want then I will start to take this investigation seriously.

[comment]Nice, so after they received backlash for saying "we found no sexual misconduct beyong hugging, kissing, and touching" they decided to edit their story. To remove the "beyond hugging, kissing, and touching".

They went from poor reporting by mitigating his troubling behavior by saying its not sexual misconduct to completely ignoring the behavior since people saw beyond their sham reporting.

[comment]I can’t wait for that tweet to show up in the courtroom
[comment]Loony Lefty's!
[comment]Took a page right out of AOC’s ‘how to absolutely destroy a business opportunity with one of the largest companies in the world’ Playbook
[comment]Communism appeals to the child as they believe it will give them everything they want.  There is no understanding of the laws of cause and effect.  

Even today people are somehow surprised that funding the Chinese Communist Party, an organization that literally farms Chinese people for body parts, runs concentration camps, and slave factories, that bad thing will come of it. 

People are surprised that allowing so-called American companies and institutions like Walmart, Apple Inc and Wall Street to profiteer off of slavery, rebrand it as innovation,  has a knock-on effect of unemployment, poverty, drug abuse and petty crime in the American heartland; not forgetting to mention a national security risk. 

Elon Musk is right. Work is a noble undertaking, not a crime.  Those communists in public office that want to label it as counter-revolutionary and a crime against the working class and the globalist communist revolution are just mentally retarded.  

Shutting down the economy to try and avoid one kind of death does not end death. All you have done is trade death by the virus for death by starvation. 

Shutting down the economy was designed to not overwhelm the health services.  So mission accomplished.  It was not intended to avoid death. Keeping the economy closed is not going to provide any more benefits than it already has. But it will introduce a lot more negatives than the virus could ever have done.  

So let just remember this about communists that are seeking to use this attack by the Chinese Communist Party to accelerate their revolution and maximize economic damage to the United States: 

"Communists never fix the problem they simply fix the blame and manufacture the problem. Because problems for communists are a fundraising opportunity and a political stage."

[comment]Whatever happened to “Oh, I’m willing to spend $2B to beat trump!”
[comment]He didn't fail. He poured tons of money into local campaigns, bought politicians across the country, and is owed favors by local and state governments lasting a lifetime. This consolidates his power in incalculable ways. Plus, the way quid pro quo's work in DC, he could be Secretary of the Treasury or some BS like that some day. Look what they gave Hilary after Obama defeated her in the primaries.
[comment]Spends half a billion to push the needle of public discourse in the Democratic patry harder towards him keeping $60 BILLION.  Sounds like a good investment.
[comment]This is a win for democracy
[comment]The real failure here is Bernie for not accepting Mike’s financial help.
[comment]Well, there goes the the endless whinging in by Democrats about buying elections. At least until the next election.
[comment]This was all a play for Biden. Warren wont drop out to split communist votes with Bernie... leaving Biden unopposed as a moderate.

We all know Biden doesn't give two shits about climate change (Ukraine) or any of those identity snakeoil policies. Once the nominee.. he will return to Obama era politics without the stupid race card shit.

He will be blown out or impeached.

I can't see any strategic benefits from removing him other than feeling good about killing a "Bad Guy". An escalation that could potentially put so many more sons and daughters in harms way. 

I'm trying to look at the big picture and understand what's the end game is. US put the maximum pressure on Iran to force them back to the negotiation table, but with what happened I doubt there will be any, anytime soon.

[comment]I haven't read the article yet but : " Madison Gesiotto is an attorney who serves with the advisory board of the Donald Trump campaign" At least they admit bias like this instead of sites like the Guardian
[comment]One thing is for sure.  The Chinese never have, and never will, actually care about being a harmonious global neighbor to US or anyone else.
[comment]It was time to divest from China 15 years ago. If American businesses don’t get the picture after this pandemic, it’s time to start voting with our dollars. Too many people have been complacent because they like getting their cheap products. Enough is enough. Get the fuck out of China.
[comment]We should pull all pharma manufacturing back to the US, these pricks can't be trusted.
[comment]It’s suspected and privately confirmed by some Chinese scientists that this is a human created virus. The CCP meant to unleash this in Hong Kong during the summer when they start protesting again but it got out mistakenly in December when it wasn’t ready.
[comment]Isn’t this the same country with over a million Muslims in concentration camps ?
[comment]Fuck China.
[comment]Of course he was. They just don't want to admit it
[comment] Big Business market's seen an advantage with China, unfortunately you get what you pay for you want cheap with problems you go China made. It just sucks that it's main stream on a big chunk of our goods, Chinese people don't care about anyone outside there immediate surroundings can't blame them it's our governments who orchestrte these deals to give cheap labor and cheap goods cheap skate bastards all of them now we the people have to live with this shit. At least Trump is trying more than I can say about the last 4 Presidents. Most of them only cared about there Image on the world stage and sold the American dream down the river to the Chinese and Mexican governments, and now they are feeling the lie, you can't share in another countries dream. We need to build the wall shut down trade with China and bring it all back to"Made In America!
[comment]But he didn’t do anything to make us less dependent on them?!?  His “deal” that they’re already violating is the same crap he railed against during his campaign but is pretty much the same deal we already had in place.  What happened to the guy that lambasted NAFTA as the worse trade deal ever, finally ripped it up but gave us the USMCA which is 99.999% the same as NAFTA, the only difference is the name
[comment]I guess the principles behind the Chinese Exclusion Act was entirely correct, just directed at the wrong country, it should have been the Italian Exclusion Act.
[comment]It's amazing if Trump hadn't gotten control if all the traffic coming in we'd probably all be wheezing and coughing by now.

He just needs to fire whoever is in charge of testing at the CDC. I bet there's a lot of people who are with me on this. Wtf are they doing there when South Korea can process 15 K CV tests a day and we have only done 5K *to date*.

Testing is what will stop us from becoming Italy. They're scary af there.

[comment]Hopefully all the Bernie Bros here in California don’t go out to the polls so that Trump somehow turns California red.  Blue California is terrible.
[comment]While this would be nice, I am skeptical that the far-left Bernie supporters will decide to support Trump.  I wouldn't be surprised if the decided not to vote, however.
[comment]I do not understand why any bernie supporter would vote for trump.
[comment]It's a smart move for Bernie supporters. The only thing the DNC might have a chance of learning from is repeated losses because they refuse to accept their new, more progressive wing.
[comment]Might go the other way too. At least moderate democrats like capitalism. Bernie out right hates it.
[comment]And Bernie to lose Biden’s supporters if nominated
[comment]I’m voting for Trump if Biden is elected and I voted for a Hilary in 2016. I’m far left and support all social justice warriors and special snowflakes and socialism. But, I am voting for trump. He is not going to roll back gay marriage, he doesn’t support racism.  His America first/ increase spending is socialism because the global free market takes jobs away from Americans.
[comment]Not this one...
[comment]It would be a dream, but they won’t vote for Trump unless they see that Bernie and Biden aren’t gonna do much to help us, but burden us.

[comment]The protesters had the moral high ground right up till they started to 'peacefully protest' by trying to murder everyone they hated.
[comment]I guess his life didn’t matter...
[comment]Imagine if people especially conservatives grasped the concept of Black Lives matter
[comment]How do you make a movement about how black lives are important then not care when one is killed by your own?
[comment]Still haven’t found the story on CNN 🙄 typical
[comment]Black lives only matter when a cop kills them. Where is the protest and outrage for Jaylon Mckenzie who was shot at a party. Where is the protesting for the innocent men and women killed by gang members. These numbers are much higher than the police involved killings. I'm not saying police brutality shouldn't be addressed I'm saying why is it black live only matter in that scenario. Why are we not on the streets demanding violence against police end. Why is there no call to end gang violence. Black lives, Blue lives, All lives matter all the time not when it is simply convenient to cause a political uprising and rioting.
[comment]There is a problem with people dying in police custody.
There are opportunists who use tragedy to push for anarchy.
David Dorn's death shows us that very little of this is real outrage. The Barbarians are at the gate and we let them in while foolish politicians condone the behavior.

[comment]This would have been preventable had local government and police been held accountable for violating the rights and liberties of American citizens.
[comment]Salute  /&gt;
[comment]As a former LEO, this is what is going to happen with all of this, police will be less active in minority neighborhoods and low-income areas, resulting in higher rates of crime, which will increase the level of black on black crime. If police are further hamstrung by regulations and oversight, then they also will be hesitant to chase down a suspect, or apprehend suspects who resist.

aka more blacks are going to die from violent crime
[comment]Not a word about this on any sub that isn't conservative leaning. Shocking.

[comment]Rest in peace David Dorn
[comment]#daviddornslifemattered
[comment]I shared a post today on Facebook honoring David dorn and I got absolutely destroyed by some crazy liberal from my high school. His argument was that the original post that I shared called David dorns killers “animals”. Apparently calling murderers animals is racial rhetoric, as he says. Funny part is the original post came from a black man AND we don’t know what color David dorns killers are. I would think they’re animals even if they were white. And it’s shocking how many people liked his comments. I responded gracefully, explaining my point was to honor this man who lost his life and spread his face around because I hadn’t seen it. I still got paragraphs and paragraphs about how it was disgusting, calling me a republican (like that’s an insult?) and way more points that I can’t even remember.

[comment]People gathered in churches while the black plague ran across Europe....we're all still here.... So you can go get a baby ripped from you or go get drunk and destroy your liver but people can't simply go to church. The vast majority of people who complain about church being a bad thing during these times have obviously never been to church. You can distance from people while sitting inside a church. Most people in a church sit away from others on purpose in order to pay attention at the task at hand, not talk to the person sitting near them. You're more likely to get sick from walking down the isle of a store, where an unknown amount of people have been through, then you are sitting in a seat listening to one person talk.
[comment]Depends where you are.
[comment]In regards of churches, too many people gather there, in stores they have people limits, and abortion clinics are technically "medical centers"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Democrats view on trump
[selftext]Me and my dad were talking the other day about how trump has handled the situation pretty well. As well as anyone could have with the info given anyway. And we were talking about how the democrats just despise him. He can't do right in their eyes and it really shows what kind of people they are. Not all democrats but most.

They would much rather millions more Americans die to coronavirus so they could blame it on him than to admit that he isn't that bad. Real patriotic right. What did Obama do when anything like this happened? With swine flu. Did nothing yet they praised him. I've even heard people saying Obama would of handled this way better.

I really didn't like trump when he got elected but I've changed my views after seeing how he has done. Since when is there anything wrong with putting America first and standing up to other countries and stop paying them all this money.

Any instances you guys have of stuff like this?[comment]Nice to hear a young independent thinker that came to a conclusion despite the constant negative buzz around trump.

If you would like to see the other view and lose all your fake internet points - go to r/politics and make this post.
[comment]I'm younger myself and came around to him just recently. In a previous life I'd even called myself a Democrat!

I really don't know what the deal is. He's even giving out money, which is their favorite thing, and even that's not enough! I think they want him to shut everything down and pay everyone's bills plus extra, but fail to understand how much power states hold... And the reason for it.

Obama could have farted in Michelle's mouth bare assed on live TV and they'd be saying how much it helped people with COVID. Same could be said for Hillary, except she'd probably charge us to watch.
[comment]So downplaying the virus and repeatedly saying it was just the flu until late Feb is responding well?
America will have more deaths than any other country and you still think trump is leading well?

[comment]It’s hilarious watching these “RED” subs. They’re dwindling more and more. I also like how the Red party loves to hate on communism. Back when ‘merica gave them Antichrist lovin commies what for! You betcha! We’re gonna drive them red commies back into the sea! 

The Republican Party has devolved into a total cesspool of guilt and shame, with the added, cult effect. It’s funny watching them trying to turn absolute lies, into “truth”. This presidency is the last gasp for this side of this two party system for many years to come. It’s hilarious watching them defend this criminal, it just keeps showing who the party is comprised of. Liars and Thieves.
Child molesters and Rapists. The Democrats have their own garbage too, not trying to be a bully here in this “Game of a throne” meaning the Presidency of the United States of America, however it just proves that these people prefer authoritarian rule to democracy. They attack everyone. Even each other. It’s a rotting snake pit of self worship. I like how they attack a college graduate, who worked her way through college, not a trust fund brat, that campaigned for change in her neighborhoods, and at a young age EARNED her seat. These people have decided to nominate her as their own, personal devil. This current President can not stand her so much, that he personally attacks her through social media almost daily. I love a stupid bully, they always tell you who they are. I’m ok with ignorance, everyone in the world is guilty of it, all of us. We can’t know every detail of every single thing. Unfortunately, the red party is all about total self destruction at this point. They can never forgive our country for allowing  a black man sitting in that office, they made damn sure a woman, though she’s a completely awful person and didn’t deserve it anyway, have that seat.  I’m not a fence sitter myself, I vote for integrity, I vote for decency, I vote for the golden rule. I don’t like every president I have lived under. I truly don’t like most of them at all, but not a single one of them thus far, has preached hate and fear, until this one. If you want that and have decided for yourself that it’s the right way to live, then I am so sorry that you have blinded yourself to goodness.

Socialism is NOT Communism. We pay taxes. We pay taxes to take care of our country. That is literally socialism! Taxes are supposed to, at least in this country, provide services for the people of this nation. It is supposed to pay for infrastructure and the general well being of our nation for EVERYONE. Not to line the pockets of private individuals for defense contracts or corporations to get lobbying money to push their agendas, just so we can turn them into little, but constantly growing, fiefdoms of their own. Vote how you want to, vote for who you want to, majority rules and all that, but holy shit, quit voting against your selves! Don’t take leaderships word as gospel. These are men and women, not gods. Look into things for yourselves. Look at both sides of the argument, and do it as dispassionately as you can. The world is changing, we have to change with it, or we are lost. Here’s an example, most citizens of other countries are at least bilingual. Most Americans are monolingual. That means that most Americans are only able to communicate with people that speak a single language. George Washington could speak French and some German. He was a very smart and capable man. President Trump struggles with words, and communicates through angry blurbs on a limited social media app. This is the leadership of the Republican Party.  I feel bad for our country and all of this partisanship. I think we can all do better  in spite of our individual differences. I still would like to believe that I can agree to disagree, be wrong sometimes, and be right sometimes. We are all only human, it’s just ridiculous when people try to elevate a person to godhood. That’s what the Republican Party has been doing, and for quite awhile now. This President should be removed from office, just because it has never happened doesn’t mean it shouldn’t. This President gifted himself plenty with other people’s money, when he was private citizen. Imagine electing Bernie Madoff into office, the king of Ponzie schemes. Guess what, we actually have, I didn’t vote for him, that’s on you “Reds”. 

The simple and singular point of my exhaustive comment here, is simply this. I can agree with some of the other side, and disagree with some of my side. Nothing is perfect, but when it’s nothing but absolute war and hatred amongst OURSELVES as citizens, then we are merely cattle to be used and paying for the privilege to be such. The founding fathers literally went to war against a Kingdom that We the People wanted to be free from. So here we are, a few generations later, trying to create another King to rule us, through a doctrine of hatred and fear. 

I’m not imploring anyone to change their mind, just asking for you, personally, as individuals to think for yourselves. Not take what leadership tells you to believe on either side. If you doubt your party, and your leadership, guess what? You’re doing it correctly. These leaders are not your or my boss. We are the bosses of them. Never forget that, no matter which side you are on. This country is not a  true democracy, by the way. It’s a representative republic. It’s a democratic form of government that votes  into proxies, the electoral college, to determine our leadership. Please use your voice to vote for whom you deem the best candidate to look out for OUR country. Thank you for your time if you bothered to read this, and seriously please, VOTE!!!<|endoftext|>

I'd like to just see someone defeat the anti semite on principle.

Side note : Louis Farakan is still on Twitter I believe.
[comment]No reason is an overstatement, she did suggest Omar should be hanged, and defended it by saying it was a statement of federal code, or something along those lines, though hanging is no longer a form of capital punishment so that defense isn’t exactly viable. Not sure if it actually broke twitters guidelines or not, but it is a serious gray area at best.

[comment]Ive recently had a change of mind after starting to follow this coronavirus closely 3 months ago. This is all being overblown. Antibody tests already showing that fatality rate is much much lower. We are being fucked economically right now from various angles. We need to reopen because just like in China and other places in Europe they are getting their second waves. We are going to have to ensure these lockdown restrictions again? It is going to be a damn cycle of this BS. This thing isnt going to disappear overnight. 

Average age of death from Wuhan and Italy last time I heard was 80-81 years old. Also the vast majority had some preexisting conditions. Vitamin D is something that helps against respiratory infections. Unfortunately we all have lower amounts of Vit D coming out of winter especially those of darker skin. 

Nancy Pelosi and the many other democrats are just causing problems because it helps their narrative.

While it is uncertain which is the best treatment and what lenght of lockdown would be best to make the pandemic manageable so we do not collapse our health system, and people in covernment have been running this as trial and error with mixed results, what is Cuomo's excuse to send COVID19 infected people to nursing homes where (as long known and proven by evidence) the people at the highest risk of dying live?
This could easily be constructed as negligent mass homicide.  Time will tell.
[comment]Covid Cuomo exported his Panda Pandemic population to other states like Florida. Florida got its infection imported directly from New York because of Covid Cuomo. Democrats always send their worst troubles away to burden people they hate. Cuomo wanted the people in the nursing homes dead, or else he would have done things different.
[comment]From here on out we shall only refer to him as, “The Nursing Home Killer”
[comment]The msm needs to apologize to the governor of Florida because he handled it very well yet they said he was a moron who was getting everyone killed, while praising a moron who got lots of people killed
[comment]Governor Wolf did the same thing in PA. No one is talking about it.
[comment]What is with you people. He kept complaining about people going out, ENFORCING wearing masks shutting down unnecessary business. What did you people do? Protest against it. Everytime he kept saying he needed ventilators prior to the peak, you people started saying he's a political puppet who's exaggerating the situation. Where does this guy win with anything? I didn't even vote for him.
[comment]Instead of answering the hard hitting questions, he prefers to keep it light and happy with his idiot sibling protecting him. It's easier to poke fun at the whole silly COVID thing. But worry not, Reddit user Foubar. We know that karma is a bitch that doesn't bypass people with clout.
[comment]Cuomo brothers:  Adolf Eichmann and Fredo
[comment]Cuomo is almost as stupid as Sleepy Joe
[comment]Make no mistake. CHINA is killing everyone with the china virus. It was weaponized by Shi Zhengli at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It "leaked" to the public in November. The Chinese allowed infected people to travel the world. This was after they knew about human to human transmission. The CCP killed people who were trying warn the public about it. EVERY COUNTRY in the world is having difficulty containing the China virus. you are shameful.
[comment]It’s OK since he’s a Democrat
[comment]MSM if they were impartial, would report it this way, but most Dems and average person will never know that this is true and will never know Cuomos leadership directly resulted in this many deaths.
[comment]The left need to be held responsible for this pandemic disaster.
[comment]He killed more New Yorker's than 9/11
[comment]And there it is, a name that should stick with him forever “The nursing home Killer”
[comment]Isn’t the death rate in LA nursing homes higher than NY nursing homes and LA didn’t use this policy?
[comment]Fredo Sr is a murderer
[comment]This is a LOL. 

He gibes 2 shits less. 

Unless you live in NY you dont get it. 

Hes called King FUAC
[comment]To be honest, I just don’t like this guy’s face. Seems to me he talks every day, but didn’t put enough energy into actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Sanders, AOC and other socialists are wrong – Socialism is a cause of poverty, not the cure
[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/justin-haskins-sanders-aoc-and-other-socialists-are-wrong-socialism-is-a-cause-of-poverty-not-the-cure[comment]This is just a straw man argument though.  There is a big difference between a socialist economy (like China and North Korea currently have) and a social democratic economy, which Sanders is arguing in favor off.  While few people would want to live in North Korea, Social democratic countries like Norway and other northern European countries tend to have GDP per capita on par with the US , yet consistently rank higher in terms of economic equality, publich health, life expectancy, quality of life and human development.
[comment]I’m broke and I’ve been capitalist my whole life.
[comment]Human centered capitalism
[comment]What do you mean? Americans are fleeing our capitalist society to socialist countries in record numbers.

Oh nevermind, apparently that isn't remotely the case.
[comment]Just so I’m clear... there’s never been poor people before 1848?

Interesting hypothesis.
[comment]It really depends. Go to Norway, Sweden, Holland or Denmark. There are virtually no people living in the streets. Venezuela on the other hand...
[comment]This entire demonization of the word socialism is stupid. An entirely socialistic system is stupid just like an entirely capitalistic system would be stupid. There are ideas on both sides of the spectrum that are good and bad. The way the united states pays for police currently is socialistic but I think it works pretty well. I wouldn't want a private police force. Giving agriculture huge bail outs is technically socialism but I don't think that was the best idea either. Yet on the other hand just letting a bunch of companies that produce food fail ( which is what the capitalistic answer would have been) probably isn't the best idea either. Labeling acts socialism is just another identity politics game to divide people which works because it takes away the need to talk about what is actually going on.
[comment]When we give tax breaks to 1%, when we spend taxpayer money on sports stadiums, when we give NASCAR taxpayer money for their track, when we give taxpayer money to relocate a business, when we give taxpayer money to Big Oil, when we give corporate welfare to profitable businesses,  when we taxpayers bailout criminal failing banks and Wall St. Isn't that Socialism?
[comment]Geez the leftist trolls are out in force tonight.
[comment] also need to realize when they say it’s”democratic socialism” it’s communism with a hint of Stalin and a pinch of hitler.  It’s not hard nowadays to brain wash the naive and down right clueless society with one word...... free.
[comment]If the Federal Governemt uses its budget to bail out a bank. Then that is government spending on a public service, that is socialism dude. We have socialism in this country rn with public schools and police officers and firefighters. That is the definition of socialism.
[comment]Dude, if the government uses its budget to fund a public service or good, then that is socialism. Just like public schools and emergency responders. Capitalists only call it a "safety net" because this is America, we bully everyone who even speaks of socialism.
[comment]Constraining your most successful people does not sound helpful to the economy. They will start with billionaires and slowly make their way down the bracket. The 1% in America aren't billionaires, it is people who make 500k/year
[comment]1.... 1 place its worked as intended?
[comment]Socialism is so completed lied about by trump.

The bank bailout was socialism.   Bailing out the iowa farmers is socialism.  Medicaid is socialism. 

I lived in Danmark.  I speak Danish. 

Danes believe the society as a whole is very important.  Education, health, childcare, and dignity as we age are very very important to danes.  Most danes sacrifice wealth to ensure society flourishes. And yes the USA defends Danmark from russia ..

The usa focuses attention to the individual.   The more power or wealth the individual has, the more rights and favors one gets.  If you have nothing, most ignore you

This is why danes live longer by a lot..why most vacation all the time, why house hold debt is trivial compared to america, why danes on average speak multiple languages fluently,  and why on average all are much more happy...and no they do not wait in line for anything..and yes they are extremely  business friendly and very innovative.   One more thing..families stay together ..kids dont move away much...unlike here in the USA where mom is in indiana, kid 1 in pa. Kid 2 in Colorado,  kid 3 and wife in michigan ..cousins in north Carolina.

<|startoftext|>[title]Majority of Americans now say they approve of Trump's handling of coronavirus: poll
[selftext]https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/488597-majority-of-americans-approve-of-trumps-handling-of-coronavirus-poll[comment]Maybe they remember the travel ban from China back in January when the Democrats were busy parading around impeachment and attacking him for being racist for banning travel.
[comment]Oh how the turntables
[comment]Tbh, his whole handling of this is the reason why I will vote for him next election. I vote independent last election. He's really surprised me in his leadership.
[comment]Sure, because he's giving free money now. Everyone loves free money until their taxes go up to pay for it.
[comment]What the media misses is that Trump is calling this "the Chinese virus" because he intends to use China as the vehicle to destroy Biden's chances on the campaign trail.  Look for Trump to attack Biden's support for past trade accords, the Obama administration's Chinese policy, and how Biden hasn't formulated much of a plan to stop China's rise.
[comment]This might just get him re-elected
[comment]Mainstream media is reverting back to the full-on negativity and anti-Trump rhetoric. No rest for the wicked.
[comment]The media and Hollywood will probably never learn or admit it, but lots and lots of us just don’t care what they say or how they overreact about everything. I have totally approved of how Trump has handled the corona virus!
[comment]good.
[comment]I might be in the minority, but I'm very disappointed with Trump's response.

Yes, the Chinese travel ban was good. But he should have extended it to South Korea and Italy much earlier once it was clear there were outbreaks there (just like was done with Iran, which was politically easy). But even then, a travel ban just delays the inevitable. If you don't use that delay to prepare, which we did not, there isn't much benefit and the end result is the same.

We should have also used our near 2 month head start to getting testing ready: free, easily available, etc. This would have allowed us to actually quarantine the infected and not shutdown our country.

South Korea was able to do this. They have had a good handle on this thing from day 1. Copious testing allowed them to catch new cases quickly and quarantine just those infected. So the number of new cases peaked quickly, within 1-2 weeks. As a result, they haven't had to shut down their economy, institute travel bans, etc.

There is no reason we couldn't have prepared for this as they did, as we had more of a head start. So no, I do not approve of Trump's response.

The one good thing we have going for us, is that companies voluntarily basically shut down everything weeks ago, relatively well ahead of Italy. Concerts and sporting events were cancelled, all employees that can work from home have been doing so, etc. So this should help us, but those were all actions we voluntarily instituted, without government policy.

If this doesn't get better quickly, I could easily see this costing Trump an election that he had in the bag, which is unfortunate because the Democrats have basically become insane.
[comment]Landslide victory, but Twitter won't let you know that with their bias.
[comment]Better late then never, I guess
[comment]I hope so I personally think the Democrats are flaming this crap. But we need this to die down by August at least. If not I feel this will really hurt Trump. But if we can contain this or beat it by August that’s just another promise kept.
[comment]The boy ones who dont are blinded by hatred for him. So ridiculous how emotion outweighs logic and critical thinking.
[comment]Reddit politics is in shambles rn
[comment]He does well 

Dems- “See, Obama prepared the government for this emergency! Trump just coasted on his plan!”

Disaster

Dems- Trump failed.... investigate why he wasn’t prepared! What a disaster!!!!!”

<|startoftext|>[title]Ben once again with the facts
[selftext]https://i.redd.it/8suvx4id2ts41.jpg[comment]Thought Ben was craftier than this. I know he’s smart enough to know that every former president, and sitting president, waits until the primaries are over or there’s a clear nominee before endorsing. That’s so he doesn’t fracture his party by endorsing someone who ends up losing the nominee. Very cheap and lazy, Ben.
[comment]If he wasn't abstaining he was waiting until the last minute. He did this when he was a senator and he did it as president. This is Obama in a nutshell.
[comment]lost the last bit of respect i had for obama.

&amp;#x200B;

think about it

&amp;#x200B;

obama was one of the last people to endorse him, and thus he has the most information that he is unfit to be president than any before him
[comment]Barry is looking like shit these days.
[comment]I'm not even all that worried about the election. Trump knows what he is doing, despite what the left says, and everyone with half a brain can see that. The democrat nominees are a joke. Biden is a senile puppet, Bernie Sanders is literally a joke, check r/dankmemes, plus he dropped out, and Bloomberg is a walking advertisement, who also gave up. So who do you think America will vote for? A frail old mouthpiece who is being used by someone who is too scared to even run themselves, or one of America's smartest and most dependable businessmen, who understands what being president means more than anybody. We have this election in the bag.
[comment]That’s the old wishy-washy Barack Husain Obama that I haven’t missed a bit.
[comment]Opportunist in chief.
[comment]Barry is looking old as fuck!!!
[comment]More importantly, Bernie Sanders endorsed someone who was credibly accused of sexual assault.
[comment]Obviously he waited till primaries are over... like most others would. It's a unity technique.
[comment]Ben cringe, groyper gang
[comment]I liked Ben at first..
[comment]Democrats will swear that’s just the way things are. 

No, you do not wait this long to endorse your vp of eight years unless you’re not 100% on board.

[comment]He's probably going to vote Trump lol.
[comment]He was waiting to hear from his satanic deity for permission to endorse geriatric pedophile Joe Biden.

[comment]I thought Lewenski really was a whistleblower though? This meme makes Trump look kinda bad though?
[comment]As a republican, I have to admit the current GOP members are embarrassing. They put in more protections for whistleblowers and now that a republican is being impeached they want to back track on the very protections they put in place. They're also acting like chickens with their heads cut off. I've read the information that both parties and Trump have put out and it's definitely looking ugly against Trump. If he is indeed guilty then he needs to be removed. Country before party always
[comment]So interesting to me that Americans spend all of this time effort and energy focusing on what they don't agree on. Instead of focusing on the things that we do and making them amazing. We truly live in a negative culture and we each hold the power to put out positivity or negativity and you guys are smart enough to know what you're doing. Why not check yourself, reflect and make things better instead of not?

Lives were lost to fight for the freedoms we enjoy &amp; our kids are being indoctrinated to ignore these freedoms. It’s crazy how good &amp; evil works &amp; how in this instance, each party thinks the other is evil. All I can rely on is what I see. I see expensive desirable neighborhoods in LA &amp; Santa Barbara becoming unlivable with urine &amp; trash in the streets. San Francisco has become a shooting frenzy where crime is now legal and cartels are taking advantage. This is not the CA where I grew up. CA is the beginning of the fall of a nation and the rest will fall if we let the coasts fail! NJ has announced following suit...as if NJ is a decent or desirable place to live? Our nation needs George Washington. Trump is here as the unpolished Washington. Thank GOD he is unpolished! I want a direct line to my president. With Trump, we have that. He gets it. The dems have tried to diminish him from inception, TRUMP 2020!!! Everyone I know is voting for this brave dude ( CA &amp; NJ).
[comment]I don't get it. The point of impeachment is to prove that trump is a criminal. How can you still support him?
[comment]I'm from the Netherlands so not all to firmiliar with the process. Could it be possible that thr democrates whould hold out to bring the impeachment to the senate untill they might hold a majority? And if so whould that come before presidential elections? Whould seem highly corrupt.

[comment]It’s not an acquittal if the jurors haven’t seen evidence to make their decision.
[comment]There's no crime, this was a fabricated BS waste of taxpayers money. It did though, lower the bar for impeachment going forward.. sadly.

in a few dozen years when we get another Dem President (after a full party reform), they will get impeached because "posted something on Tik Tok we found offensive".

I am glad the "DO nothing DEMS" are done wasting time on this sham. They are loosing their own supporters
[comment]&gt; Now that this unbelievable waste of five months inflicted on the American people

This and honestly the last 3 years of behavior by the Dems should be criminal.  They've wasted an incredible amount of time and tax money chasing after imaginary problems rather than being productive representatives who are bound to uphold the Constitution.
[comment]I’m thrilled the liberals got there hopes up, only to be crushed. It brings me joy to know that the dems will not get their way and they know it and have known it all along.

The best kind of liberal is the one who has run out of hope.
[comment]Everyone I know wanted to hear from witnesses. If he was so innocent, why block witnesses? Trump won't be president forever so whatever prescedents set now could be used against Republicans later. To be honest, it's hard to believe Trump since he lies so often and acts so unchristian.

[comment]Well it's hard not to mention any of the shit republican politicians considering how terrible of a job they're doing. It's also hard to do considering that's who Biden is running against and of course people are going to compare them. Do you view voting where you only support the person you like? Voting has always been a "which candidate is the least terrible."

There are things Biden would do that are better than Trump, so naturally people are going to compare the two when choosing. 

Silly.
[comment]I don't know how anyone can see Donald trump and think "yessssssss this is exactly what George Washington had in mind yesss"
[comment] hashtag DropOutBiden is trending on twitter
[comment]I think it’s a valid statement regardless. Imo both are not ideal so I’m not going to argue for either of them lol. But I will say “this person is better than this person” and therefore this is who I’m supporting. It’s similar to the the 2016 election - there were a lot of people who voted against Hillary or Donald instead of for a candidate. What I don’t understand is how we keep finding ourselves in these positions 😂
[comment]I expect down votes and I won't be voting for either but the case can be made Biden has been better for the environment
[comment]Biden doesn't know who his wife is...he doesn't know what State he is in....thinks he is running for the Senate....He says China is no threat .....and he is quid pro quo hair sniffing groping sleepy Joe

Who would vote for him??????
[comment]They can't make the case with or without mentioning Trump
[comment]What was most amazing is how before Sanders dropped out the big subreddits (news, politics, etc) were all talking "BIDEN BAD".

Now that Biden is their only fiddle you saw a whole round of opinion culling with "Maybe Biden isn't so bad" and "Vote Blue down the ticket", etc.

[comment]Why can't we mention Trump? He's the worst president this country has ever seen
[comment]to be fair, mentioning trump is fair game because he is the only other alternative now.

Not that I think Biden should be elected—at least I certainly hope he won’t be—but if someone’s only reaason for voting for him is “he is not trump” then I can understand why they would take that approach.
[comment]Well yes... trump is the reason that people will vote for Biden. Biden wouldn't be my first choice, but trump would be my last.

You guys are making fun because a entire party has taken such extreme decisions just to save the country?
[comment]As a lefty, a case can be made but it isn't. That's why the left keep losing. Negative campaigning rarely works. Even Trump's popularity among republicans decreases when he starts degrading his opponents. Every politician is a stronger candidate  when they talk about what they have done, are doing, and will do for the voters. Biden has the style to win but isn't talking enough substance to seal the deal.

[comment]The amazing thing is they are being defended. Even if they are protesting injustice, which they’re not, these looters are hoodlums not there for Floyd, 400 years of oppression does not excuse this,
[comment]It stopped being just a riot when they started attacking police stations, police cars, taking weapons, robbing banks, stores, and began murdering people.

It stopped being about George Floyd when organized attacks on businesses, police, fire departments began

It stopped being about George Floyd when a uniformed mob of thugs started chanting  "Kill the White man".

What kind of lunacy are we living in when white people are chanting " Kill White People"? 

It is an insurgency.  And that is what happens when one political party use the intelligence agencies and the federal bureau of investigations in a coup d'état to overthrow the president of the United States just because their Wall Street backers are pissed that their $500 billion dollars a year Chinese Communist Party grift has been ended. 

Hey, Jamie &amp; Goldman call off your media attack dogs on the President or you will not be facing a civil court but a military tribunal. The Chinese Communist Party trade game is over it's not coming back; EVER!

Fix your media messaging or lose everything you have.

Today should have been about America going back into space.  Wall Street made it about getting rid of the President of the United States because he has ended the game of selling out the United States citizens to the Chinese Communist Party.  A $500 Billion dollar a year grift that was bankrupting the nation and killing our citizens.  

Follow the money.  The groups that organized the nationwide terrorist insurgency are funded.  Their comms are trackable.  

Jamie &amp; Goldman fix it. Fire the talking heads across the board every network. Call Jack, Eric, Susan, Mark and tell them how it is.  End it now. You created this monster time to shut off the taps. CALL IT IN.   Stop funding these communist movements.  

Otherwise, look around it will all be gone forever.  

The Chinese Communist Party trade is over. Done.  It is never, ever, ever coming back.  The Democrats are finished.  The Rob-Public-Wecans are done.  Lean in on this and the consequences are not just going to reverberate in the United States but around the world. There will not be a safe market anywhere. You will end up with nothing. Your children will end up with nothing.  Your grandchildren will end up with nothing.  And the Mob that you have created will come for you.  The Hamptons is not a dependable position.  You will have no way to run, nowhere to run to.  Your mansions will end up being your graveyards.

I really want to know if you really and truly beleive this is all antifa.<|endoftext|>

[comment]I'm just gonna sit back and wait for the videos of people in vagina hats burning their Notorious R.B.G gear lol
[comment]well, shes about to pass away. RIP
[comment]For someone who’s innocent, he sure is trying to make sure no one sees those tax records. Doesn’t it seem odd that he goes to this much trouble to keep people from seeing it even though he said he’d release them on the campaign trail.? I see a lot of inconsistencies and I’m confused how you guys are blinding looking past it. 

If you have a valid reason to refute me please have at it. I honestly would like to hear everyone’s side.
[comment]The people who love Ginsburg have never read a single one of her opinions; nor have the people that hate her for that matter. She’s a reasonable woman and has made decisions favoring things that people who love her would hate
[comment]Liberals are preparing to unplug her...
[comment]Misleading headline. She upheld a stay so the court could have a week to decide their next steps. This is purely procedural.

[comment]Makes people think that all non conservatives are baby killers
[comment]This is true
[comment]I’m pro guns pro choice pro weed and pro trump. Don’t lump all Republicans into the pro life category
[comment]Either way if you don’t wrap up or take other precautions, you should have to pay for the abortion.
Talkin to you bernie, piece shit
[comment]Boomerest thing I've seen today
[comment]Yeah im definitely conservative but thats a pretty boomer thing to post, settle down, things like this get us all lumped up.
[comment]Personally i am against abortion since i have my shit together. But not in all cases. If i had a 15 16 year old daughter i'd be for it. Since she whould still need to focus on school and getting her life on track.

I am however ALWAYS against abortion to just be used as anti conception replacement for the pill or condoms.

And the person wanting one. Should always pay out of pocket. Its a privelidge not a right.
[comment]Whoa! No words...
[comment]Pro-life or choice that baby’s gonna need a rhinoplasty stat.
[comment]It's fun how they demand everyone has the right to live, even if your parents can't provide for you.

...right until you turn 18 without having any marketable skills and you can go right ahead and starve, you lazy leech upon society.
[comment]My mom is pro choice conservative so I’d say I’d hope she’s pro-life
[comment]"I do not believe that just because you're opposed to abortion that that makes you pro-life. In fact, I think in many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed. And why would I think that you don't? Because you don't want any tax money to go there. That's not pro-life. That's pro-birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro-life is." - Sister Joan Chittister

Pro life people have no consideration for the fact that the baby they'll force to be born, might just be forced into a situation where they are suffering.  Shame
[comment]“I hope I wasn’t the result of an attack by a violent or incestuous rapist...”

Fixed it for you
[comment]Oh man these comments are a treat
[comment]This shit is what makes conservatives look bad. Facebook tier memes don't belong. This is the type of shit you see old people sharing because they think they're "hip with the kids".
[comment]If a fetus could actually have that thought, then yes, it would be immoral to abort.  Fortunately, the fetal brain doesn't begin showing recognizable brain wave patterns until week 26, after 99.9% of all the abortions have already happened.

Quit trying to use emotionally charged images in lieu of cogent arguments.
[comment]I'm pro-choice
[comment]I think abortion is good for _some_ cases, but not all. Why shouldn’t a woman be allowed to choose?
[comment]My opinion is that abortions are like guns: If they're illegal then people will just get them illegally.
[comment]Surely you see that what you are talking about is COMPLETELY different, and thus not applicable as an argument, for two reasons:
1. Raising an animal is worlds apart from bringing a human to this Earth. It is 5-10 years commitment of your time for an animal, compared with 18+ years of having a child. 
2. When a woman has a child, she has something GROWING INSIDE OF HER. I think she should be able to decide if and when she is ready to have this happen for her. What you are talking about is... I think a dog being bred?

FYI I am a man; one who believes that women should be able to choose whether they let something grow in their bodies.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Goodbye. All they do is report fear.
[comment]So that’s why cnn isn’t covering the sexual assault allegations against Biden...
[comment]We don't need 75% of the people calling themselves "journalists". And if I never again have to see the ramblings and rants of pop culture critics and intersectional social justice types I'll be a happy camper.
[comment]This is why they should've learned to code.
[comment]But how will I get my Brian Stelter fix?
[comment]Of course my friend, always a pleasure.
[comment]"Journalists"
[comment]In actually communist countries, the state controls the media. The free press is essential to freedom. That's why the founders put it in the constitution.
[comment]Recently, they interrupted and shut down a doctor who criticised the quarantine.

Clearly, he wasn't saying what they wanted to hear.
[comment]I will do the news for free lol
[comment]CNN confusing themselves with Fox?
[comment]Some good news
[comment]Laid off or arrested?  The crime:  pretending to be journalists.
[comment]Maybe we need more teachers since the post itself has two errors. Hmm
[comment]Maybe just maybe if journalists reported fairly and honestly and with integrity, I would actually care. Which is hard to say because I want everyone to make a living. I don’t like when people make a living pushing fear and hate. It’s like Eric Matthews once said, “Life’s tough, get a helmet.”

[comment]She knew this would happen. She knew it would be an aimless waste of taxpayer dollars. I'd say she won out tbh. Her goal was to get fuel for a smear campaign in 2020, and I'd say she got it.

Can you hear it yet? "Donald Trump is the ONLY PRESIDENT TO BE IMPEACHED THIS CENTURY. Even a member of his own party KNEW that he ABUSED HIS POWER. Dump Trump. Vote Democrat."

They can say that now. I watched 20 minutes of msnbc after the votes and all they talked about was how Romney voted guilty and how heroic it was. I nearly puked.

 Amazing how off the rails the Republican Party was with that Demopublican as our nominee. Who knew Donald Trump would single handedly save the Republican Party?
[comment]I know it won’t happen. But if the republicans win back the house and Biden wins in 2020. What the republicans need to do is at 12:01 on January 20th is introduce articles of impeachment.
[comment]They knew all along the president wouldn’t get removed. They wanted the spectacle.

Trump did nothing wrong, and now he’s acquitted.
[comment]&gt;I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is **no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven** and that does not meet the United States Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense.”   
  
&gt;  
&gt;I do not believe that additional witnesses are needed.  I have said consistently for the past four months, since the Zelensky transcript was first released, that I believe that some of the president’s actions in this case – including asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine – were wrong and inappropriate.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It is clear from the July 25, 2019, phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky that the investigation into the Bidens’ activities requested by President Trump **was improper and demonstrated very poor judgment.** …Regardless, it was wrong for President Trump to mention former Vice President Biden on that phone call, and it was wrong for him to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**the Senate should be ashamed by the rank partisanship that has been on display**. …**The President’s behavior was shameful and wrong.  His personal interests do not take precedence over those of this great nation**.  The president has the responsibility to uphold the integrity and honor of the office.  Not just for himself but for all future presidents.  **Degrading the office, by actions or even name calling, weakens it for future presidents, and weakens our country.**   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a “high crime and misdemeanor.” Yes, he did.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I believe that delaying the aid was **inappropriate and wrong** and shouldn’t have hap

So let it be said, that any future president can coerce a foreign government to investigate a political opponent. Such a normal day in American politics.
[comment]Glad the truth prevailed over a hoax/made up accusations
[comment]It upsets me that some people are dumb enough to believe that the impeachment trial wasn't politically motivated, if Trump was guilty something obviously would have been found by now.  I can't wait to see how triggered they get in 2020 :D 4 MORE YEARS!!!!!<|endoftext|>

No he hasn't. There literally isn't a wall.

No, it's been pretty much the same: https://www.statista.com/statistics/188165/annual-gdp-growth-of-the-united-states-since-1990/

&gt;China came back to the table and capitulated. It was a massive victory for the U.S. economy, small business, manufacturers, farmers,

Pretty weird victory for farmers if you have to bail them out at taxpayers expense: [U.S. to pay farmers up to $16 billion for trade war losses](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/us-to-pay-farmers-up-to-16-billion-for-trade-war-losses-south-to-benefit-idUSKCN1UK2M7)

I don't agree with all of what r/conservative does, but one of the many things they do right is policing posts to ensure that it remains a partisan subreddit. I think it wouldn't hurt to do the same thing here.<|endoftext|>

[comment]According to the democratic voting roles, nobody died.
[comment]That's odd simply because all those body bags lined up and all those people who are no longer on this earth...but okay then, a Democrat would never lie.
[comment]I’m so sick of this “pandemic” being politicized because it shows the ignorance of one side vs the other.

I’m sick of hearing from folks that received government assistance saying we shouldn’t return to work and normalcy.

Of course not, they want more free money from the government.  I’m a 31 year old male, single, doing well for myself and have savings.

I’m dipping in to my savings as needed but I get no assistance from the government.  I sure as hell paid for that assistance... but I’m tired of these idiots complaining that they don’t want to go back to work because it’s more profitable for them not to.

These are the same morons that have 8 kids and receive substantial government assistance.  So tired of this shit.
[comment]Incorrect, Governor.
[comment]Got $50 that says you'll find the deceased names on a Democratic voter ballot , in the very near future.
[comment]But you kinda did. Not even trying to hide their lies anymore, wow.
[comment]Cough*bullshit*coughcough
[comment]The quote in the title is severely cut off. Regardless of my own stance on this issue, we shouldn’t be posting such misleading titles. “We didn’t lose anyone” is very, VERY different from what the full quote is. We can do better. 

“And we didn’t lose anyone for want of medical care, precautions, et cetera.”
[comment]It’s sad that literally no one wanted to politicize any of this until the dems decided every single death in covid is somehow trumps fault. The dems have actually done the worst of everyone in this and they are the ones trying to politicize it. I’m sorry, but I’m a liberal and I think the democrat party can go fuck it self.
[comment]It was an intentional move to increase the total number of fatalities and make the Federal Government increase the funds for NY. The guy is a Criminal and in NY we all know that.
[comment]The Butcher of Brooklyn tries to deflect blame.

[comment]Sad that he sent covid-19 positive patients back to nursing homes and not to a proper quarantine.  

I know hindsight is always 2020, but the people deserved better judgment from Cuomo than this.
[comment]I hate fake news more than the next guy. But he constantly complained about the amount of people New York lost. Begging for ventilators prior to the peak curve. We need to stop politicizing the situation. The man NEVER said this.
[comment]We were called inconsiderate and muzzled 3 months ago when we said we should just super safe guard people at risk (based on Italy's data).... Looks like Andrew Cuomo and the rest of society should have listened.
[comment]Up hill battle to get anyone to investigate fairly across all party lines.  We’ve crossed over into the twilight zone of half-truths, outright lies and lackadaisical journalism that impacts everything we read or hear.

&gt;On March 25, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an [advisory](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/doh_covid19-_nhadmissionsreadmissions_-032520.pdf) for hospitals to discharge elderly patients with COVID-19 back to nursing homes -[thefederalist](https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/28/cuomo-claims-he-didnt-know-about-new-york-rule-forcing-nursing-homes-to-accept-elderly-with-covid-19/)

&gt;No resident shall be denied readmission or admission to the Nursing Homes solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. Nursing homes are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.

[Now they are hiding the nursing home coronavirus deaths](https://dailycaller.com/2020/05/15/new-york-coronavirus-reporting-nursing-home-deaths-undercounting/)
[comment]How many other states shoved recovering covid 19 patients into nursing homes and rehab centers?  

Is it standard hospital / insurance practice for recovering patients?  Certainly makes sense for a hip injury, but Not for a contagious virus.  

Seems the focus was on discharging in order to clear bed space for new patients.  Yet the Javits center build out was for naught.

<|startoftext|>[title]Pink Pill Feminism... needs to be removed
[selftext]https://www.change.org/p/reddit-reddit-needs-to-remove-or-quarantine-the-pink-pill-reddit[comment]So this probably doesnt matter to mich of you but there is a sub reddit purely made as a platform to hate men. reddit has constantly shut down and quarentined any sub reddit that shows any signs of “hate speech”... except only when its a male trying to express anything of the opposite idea of a “feminist”. unfortunately im sure we are all probably aware of the ever worsening problem that is the snowflake party, or “feminists” who are using the word ‘feminism’ as if it means hating men and screaming its for equality when really your just opressing men. and thats what pink pill feminism is, a sub reddit, or a “digital safe space” where they constantly wish death and rape against males and celebrating male suicide rates etc. if reddit is to keep its promise it will also remove the actual source of “hate speech” and not just the ones they accuse. its funny how they have things like this and blackpill feminism (which is a whole different subject) calling them “safe spaces” while whenever a male safe space is attempted to be made, they shut it down for “hate speech”. like wtf this reddit, its literally for freedom of speech but again thats another issue. please help me, and thousands if other men and sign a petition for reddit to remove it. thank you for your time of reading this paragraph. goonight and stay safe, dont go outside unless necesary.
[comment]Hmm. It doesn't sound like a very conservative thing to do. Where does it end if we start trying to ban each other? How does free speech win if everyone is trying to silence everyone?
[comment]The left may not be better than restricting free speech but we should be.  

We hate it when liberal regressive attempt to silence anything we should practice what we preach here.

[comment]Democratic socialisy here, but the idea that you have free speach on a platform you don't own is idiotic.
[comment]Incel subs incite violence against women to a dangerous degree.  They *should* be removed just as pro-ISIS subreddits should be removed.

The subs that mock incels aren't inciting violence against them.
[comment]Last time I ate a pink pill I started hallucinating
[comment]Yea that’s why I’m not defending the free speech part of it, I’m just saying if they are actually going to remove hate speech then remove pink pill and places that are designed for hate speech
[comment]So does r/redpill
[comment]While the white-supremacist guy (an Asian actually) who actually raped 13 women gets 200 year of jail and you all mourning him I bet.
[comment]No you don't get it, they hate men *ironically*
[comment]Stfu
[comment]lets brigade then
[comment]To be clear, I am not trying to censor anyone, I am trying to show them how rules are supposed to work, if they find comfort in hating men and making a place for that, go right ahead, I got better shit to do, what I am saying is if reddit wants to put out blanket rules and suppress hate speech, they must stay true to that with both sides. I don’t care about suppressing them, you can’t they control pretty much every bit of social media, but, I’m trying to show them that removing sub Reddit’s on the exact same issue, but with the opposing gender or race or political stance etc. is biased and not how you should run a platform made for speech and expression. If they want to be profesional, they will either make a choice of taking no sides, and removing them, or stop suppressing others with separate views than themselves, I apologize if I offended anyone. Have a good day, and stay safe in quarantine.<|endoftext|>

Compare [the 2016 presidential election results at the county level](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Texas_Presidential_Election_Results_2016.svg/300px-Texas_Presidential_Election_Results_2016.svg.png) to [the population of Hispanics within Texas at the county level.](https://i.redd.it/ii9vkzmdm9w01.png) Also keep in mind that only around half of the Hispanic population in Texas is currently elligible to vote so we are not yet seeing the full impact this will have on Texan politics. Over the next two decades, that other half will come of age and the state will cease to be the Republican stronghold it has been for so long. As a result of this massive demographic transformation (the Texans never wanted), Texas is going to turn into a battleground state.

[comment]This is a direct result of the tax reform passed by Republicans in 2017.  It eliminated the high Federal deductions for state and local taxes that allowed NY to get away with charging more than other regions. 

Prior to the Republican tax reform, essentially the rest of the country was subsidizing the taxes in New York by unwilling proxy.

This NY Times article from 2017 includes a graphic showing how high NY taxes will affect them even more after reform. [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/business/economy/tax-bill-new-york.html)

[comment]It's the part where he asks the President of Ukraine to  investigate Biden.  Asking a foreign nation to aid in an election is illegal.  The chair of the FEC warned Trump of this a few weeks before the call, plus the whole Mueller investigation should have clued him in to this as well.    

Here's the FEC chair after Trump announced that he might accept help from a foreign government if they offered it:

"Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office: It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. This is not a novel concept. Electoral intervention from foreign governments has been considered unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation. Our Founding Fathers sounded the alarm about 'foreign Interference, Intrigue, and Influence.' They knew that when foreign governments seek to influence American politics, it is always to advance their own interests, not America's. Anyone who solicits or accepts foreign assistance risks being on the wrong end of a federal investigation. Any political campaign that receives an offer of a prohibited donation from a foreign source should report that offer to the Federal Bureau of Investigation." -- Ellen L. Weintraub chair of the Federal Election Commission (FEC)

The only way to quantify what the voters are having to choose from on the Democrat side is to Just imagine having the choice between 7 tall glasses of diarrhea, all are warm and thick as a milkshake. Now imagine being told you have to drink one if those glasses of diseased poop using a straw so thin it will take you at least 4 years to finish. Also imagine that the only one that is of any difference at all is the one that has had a bottle of hot sauce poured in it. Now it is going to be painful as fuck to swallow, but at least the smell of rancid shit will be cancelled out be the burning hellfire in your throat and gut. THAT is what choosing Bernie is like. Trump on the other hand is like a bag full of Jelly Belly , Jelly Beans. All kinds of wonderful deliciousness, with an occasional gross bit, but the vast majority is delightful and well enjoyed by all, even those who refuse to admit they are benefitting from the sweet tasty goodness.

[comment]Breadline Bernie, the reactionary communist, is what a lot of Americans want. Young Americans who have been indoctrinated into accepting socialism will come out to vote in droves.

There is a very real chance Breadline can get elected honestly. And if you take into consideration the socialist predilection for vote fraud the 2020 election could be very close.

Getting cocky is bad. I still recall how people thought Americans would not elect an unaccomplished socialist with racists and terrorist friends as president. We saw how well that worked out.

[selftext]https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-trump-launches-massive-all-out-military-war-on-drug-cartels[comment]Good
[comment]Sounds like a waste of money, especially given the amount of money we threw into the "relief" package. Most effective way to impact the Drug Cartels would be to legalize drugs to cut off one of the Cartel's major sources of revenue.
[comment]We’ll win the war on drugs this time amirite?
[comment]So we take the money seized from the cartels and use it to offset the national debt... win win?
[comment]They're staying at home, should be easy to find!
[comment]Did we lose or win the last "war on drugs"?

Actually I'm all for fighting the cartels.  However that means that we need to establish the basic rule of law through out much of Mexico, Central America and South America.  And to do that right, it's going to take time, money, and a lot of bodies.
[comment]Had to be during the one time I wanted some illegal drugs.
[comment]Good now have our military patrol our southern border.
[comment]Straight up, right now is not the time to worry about a Mexican problem because many Americans are going to die because of what is happening from the Chinese pandemic
[comment]Never go full retard
[comment]We’ll see if it works. Break up the big Mexican cartels so only the low volume dealers exist near the US Southern Border. 

It may convince the big Columbian dealers, that its easier to move their business elsewhere. 

Also, with more forces at the  Souther Border area, this can also serve to stem illegal immigration.
[comment]This will only make the drug cartels stronger. If he was serious about taking them down he would legalize the recreational drug market.
[comment]If we do this with the mexican government then I am all for this. I have thought about it, I could be wrong, but part of me thinks we should rid us and Mexico of these cartels. It isn't an ideology like the middle east, this is a business and we are not putting a war on the drugs but the people who pump these drugs. I think this could be the right way to fight the war on drugs, but we will see.
[comment]As long as the demand exists, this war won't be won. Not even close.
[comment]For all of you who are against this and are advocating for legalization, I want you to stop and think about some things. 1) Do the Cartels strictly rely on the drug trade for business/profit. 2) What effect would legalization of all drugs have on our communities and individuals who struggle with drug abuse. And 3) if drugs were legalized would that not in turn force the cartels to ramp up other illegal trades to make up for the profit?

[Here is an interview between Joe Rogan and Ed Caledron, an former Mexican Police Officer and veteran of the war on drugs.](https://youtu.be/llhb2ymtsw8)

BUT we live in the 21st century where people should not shoot each other and don´t need to get a baby everytime they have sex.  
Must be hard to belive but you will get used to it eventually. And if you think you can never life with that you may pull the trigger of your gun one more time ;)
[comment]Allowing her access to abortion is the exact opposite of encouraging sex with a minor, protecting a little girl from having to deal with a pregnancy that could kill her is something I support, especially if the girl was sexually abused.<|endoftext|>

[comment]How many times has quip pro Joe been filmed sniffing and grinding?
[comment]As a lefty this is vile. Literally the only thing keeping our side insulated from attacks of “your politicians do it too!” is the contingent action of consequences.
[comment]Let’s see if this major news ends up on r/politics or not...
[comment]I had literally forgotten. It's nowhere.
[comment]Liberal here. Fuck Joe. He is a predator.
[comment]Hey look DNC, an out. You can pick another nominee. Please take it and give Trump an opponent worth crushing.
[comment]That hypocrisy is fucking sick. Sure let's go up in arms and protest nationally because someone accused Kavanaugh, but the moment it's one of their own, it goes from #BelieveAllWomen to #BelieveSpecificWomen

The left can go fuck itself
[comment]Do as I say and not as I do.

 -The left
[comment]It's not the left.  The left is protesting it big time.  But the DNC isn't left.  They're center right if not full right wing.
[comment]Fuck Biden, and fuck Trump too, dude has like 17 pending cases.  Im just saying this is nothing new.  Let's set party politics aside, and all agree, as a country, there are definitely better candidates then what they force on us.
[comment]The virus has captured all the attention, but this won't go away. Joe's done. The Dems have a huge problem on their hands. November looks very bad for them.
[comment]Everyone I know who is 'left' (myself included)  was disdainful of Joe for years now, but the damn establishment and fear of losing got all the older Dems to stick with him for the 'sake of beating Trump'.

Fuck Joe, when the Ukraine stuff came up I was praying it'd end his campaign even though it was blown out of proportion.
[comment]During a pandemic?  I haven't heard about the election either.  All I hear is about the CoVid-19 virus.  Once things get back to normal, have at him.  Until then, lets try to stay healthy and protect our citizens, both conservative and liberal.
[comment]Anyone surprised? Clinton was seconds away from getting into the White House and her husband is a literal rapist who couldn't even keep it out of the oval office. How much believing did they do to the Clinton's rape and assault victims, not to mention the ones they straight up murdered?

Anyone surprised? They are supposed champions of the LGBT movement, despite running goalie for Islam, probably the #1 contributor to anti-women and anti-LGBT violence in the world.

They're hypocrites, we all know this. Just sit back and laugh all the way to November. Polls routinely show that they are being viewed as less and less trustworthy.

Rome didn't fall in a day and these media goons won't disappear tomorrow. They'll die out over the next few decades. They're already virtually no different than Buzzfeed, just wait till more and more people stop watching.
[comment]Absolutely right about this. Also, you all should look in the mirror too.
[comment]This is the problem. I ask an honest question and you can’t be civil. Thank you for providing something. If you swallowed your emotional need to call me brain dead we could of had a good convo. But please continue to rage and I’ll continue my salt mining. 

Ps real proof is Hillary having servers in her basement ;). Now two was about it, if I took a gov flash drive home they would lock me up and throw away the key. 

All university’s start off unaccredited,
All billionaires have failed high risk business ventures,
Never heard of a trump bail out but I’ll look.

[comment]Either way, we still wouldn’t have the first female Vice President.
[comment]I don't know why people thought she would. That was a big rumor from the Q crowd.
[comment]Takes real balls to tell the Democrat nominee to get lost.
[comment]Who would even think she's a good candidate for VP the very idea is stupid.
[comment]I’ve been subscribed to the theory that the Obamas have gotten used to a life of luxury and don’t want to get back into the mud of DC, particularly Michelle
[comment]Regardless of what you think of her, I don’t blame her. She saw it suck the life out of her husband, why would she want that?!
[comment]Bummer. It would have been great to watch her show her true colors over and over again.
[comment]She probably  knows that as soon as she's  on board something will cause Joe to drop out of the race. Voluntary or involuntarily...
[comment]DNA test please.
[comment]Obviously. She doesn’t want to be suicided by the Clintons. She knows anyone blocking Hillary is at risk.
[comment]Says every candidate ever right before they take the nomination.
[comment]Joe said he’s picking a female
[comment][Bill Burr being NSFW and hilarious about pandemics and also Michelle Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgcpedl8a8c). Weirdly topical
[comment]Correction.....”He...doesn’t want the job” with Biden.....

🤫
[comment]Translation: She doesn't want to kick it off by losing spectacularly
[comment]Shouldn't it be "He"?
[comment]Just what we need , another activist President.
[comment]I just get reminded of her early comments to people about not wanting to be First Lady, then taking solo skiing trips in the Alps and getting early copies of movies and shows. She won’t be VP, she enjoys the perks of power and not the power itself.
[comment]She has never made an indication that she wanted anything to do with politics. 

The only reason this was a mention was because of people who are still jerking themselves off to the O’s and also to the thought of a black female VP.
[comment]Gotta stay focused on being the next mr. Universe
[comment]Lol what could possibly qualify her to be VP?
[comment]&gt;“The question is, is this the way in which she wants to continue her life of service?” 

I almost choked.

[selftext]https://issuesinsights.com/2020/01/18/america-is-deeply-divided-because-the-left-has-become-so-shallow/[comment]America is deeply divided because the media demonizes one side or the other. Now both sides view the opposite as "an enemy trying to destroy America." 

We all want a better country, and we all have beliefs on how we should accomplish that. We need to stop convincing ourselves and each other that the opposite side wants to destroy this country. 

Sure, some politicians are just in it for personal gain, but the inhabitants of this country are mostly looking to make America great.
[comment]It's a time of political extremes and rising populism of both the far right and the far left. Our democracies can come out of this stronger, but I feel a lot is gonna change in the coming years.
[comment]Because that headline is not divisive...
[comment]And we have to admit Trump isn't helping the matter either.
[comment]What’s with people in the city being democrat???
[comment]We can not let the do nothing Democrats take over

All betting sites in Vegas have Trump winning in 2020
[comment]I'm a hard core right winger Trump supporter and I have a very good friend who is a Bernie supporting liberal. We still talk about politics and surprisingly have some stuff in common. He's pretty rational too for the most part. I still disagree with him but he showed me that not everyone on the other side of politics is an enemy
[comment]Just remember to get out there and Vote November. Virginians screwed up and not everyone voted, just the few liberals here did and now liberals took over and they are trying to take our guns. Please please pass this on, these lefties will come out in drones to try and take out Trump. We can't let this happen.<|endoftext|>

[comment]The problem is the income limit is going to be 75K. So most of us wont get any. it is basically for poor intercity people.
[comment]why are we handing checks to people who have the fortune of having employment that continues to pay them?  
  
should we just look at some type of salary replacement for those currently out of work?  unemployement covers some of it, but why not just make them whole?
[comment]Look at the turntables

Everyone else is very reactive.

[comment]LOL.  A whos who of the Obama Administration.

[comment]This would only help Trump....
[comment]Please tell us.
[comment]This is an old report. But I think every republican welcomes this. I hate to say it but that's a core difference between dems and repubs. Repubs want all truths revealed. Dems only if it backs their story. I want to see who took bribes dem or Republican. Were all just pretty confident it's mostly or all dems lol

[comment]Excellent.......It is hardly a threat though
[comment]Well. We’re waiting.
[comment]DO IT
[comment]Oh please, Iran, don't expose the corruption. You can't do that...
[comment]If they are smart, they could literally be doing to because they are afraid and it will help them get us to stop attacking.
[comment]Ok
[comment]Well despite the fact that the article is old, maybe these current events will bring it back to his memory and he'll follow through with his great idea.
[comment]Do it!

[selftext]https://www.dailywire.com/news/china-threatens-australia-if-it-pushes-for-investigation-over-coronavirus-report-says[comment]That must mean there is something of value there if you literally threaten another country over it.

That or China is sick and tired of being harassed about it. My money is on the former.
[comment]China is asshoes
[comment]Until we get an actual investigation, I propose that the official records show 1 billion infected, 250 million dead. And it came from a lab. Just label them with all the worst.
[comment]Oh no! Fewer Chinese tourists!? Where will we get our roadside litter from now?
[comment]A definite sign there should be an investigation.
[comment]Countries need to answer China's aggression. By forcing companies to remove their factories from China.

Let's see how XI deals with 40% unemployment
[comment]Fuck this guy, Cheng.
[comment]China threatens another country after what has happened in the world. Your looking better and better china......sad
[comment]Can we just stop harassing the Chinese? They're going through a lot right now.
[comment]So expect Australia to not mention a word about corona ever again.
[comment]Fuck Jing Ping Pong
[comment]It is time the world turns on china
[comment]Australia releases massive amount of feral felines into Chinese territory decimating bat population and crippling bat market vicariously saving the world.

Edit: Australia also networks and *collaborates* with other countries( not threatens ) to help immunize cats from the virus making them apex predators capable of taking out pandas. :o
[comment]As if neither America nor the United Nations would be forced to defend Austraila? Good luck with that, China. It's also been made public knowledge that if China were to make the first move that Russia would be less inclined to defend China against retaliation of other countries, America included... So yeah, good luck with that, China.
[comment]Just tell everyone you are guilty while you are at it.
[comment]The Australians are racist towards the Chinamen for wanting an investigation.
[comment]Boo china
[comment]Sounds like China has something to hide. Everyone knows that with WHO's communist leader, China was given cover for it's lies. The world was made less safe because the true deadly nature of the virus was delayed. Even a smaller country like Italy reported more deaths than China.
[comment]China purposely  allowed infected people to fly all over the world when they had an internal travel ban, that is a smoking gun of ill intent.
[comment]Whats China going to do to Australia? 

Quit selling them cheap products that break?
[comment]Let them, let's link up with the Aussies and go liberate Hong Kong and be welcomed as heros, then start stepping all over pooh bear.

[comment]Of course not, because no one cares how anything gets paid for. Just tax the rich! It's fine!
[comment]You can't just say "tax the rich! tax the rich!" when you don't even know the cost of the programs you're proposing. If Sanders wins the presidency, he's going to bankrupt the hell out of the US more than we're already. We're seeing $1T deficits right now and it's only going to get worse if all of these programs come to fruition.
[comment]My favorite is when they swear up and down it will *save* money.
[comment]That face says it all of what he's done, "Hahaha, I've brainwashed and lied to all of these people. They actually believe the bullshit that I'm telling them, I say it'll be free when they'll be paying more money."
[comment]Ideological zealotry is rampant on the Left right now, even going so far as resorting to physical violence as a form of lashing out.

Trump received just criticism for the more extreme elements in his base of support; but Sanders and the "Bernie Bros" take it to a whole new level.

-

The ideological zealots of the Left intentionally argue in bad faith (I've engaged some today who turned out to be disgusting people), and then they resort to threats when they get called out.

Sanders has no shot of winning by virtue of the fact his brand is going to be incredibly toxic as more of this behavior comes to light.
[comment]If he thinks the rich will just allow that to happen, he's so damn wrong. The rich, with all their money and influence are going to use every avenue they have to push back 10 fold. 

Sure Bernie, you sound great to idiot adults and stupid teenagers, but those people fall for MLM schemes... so you're not impressing anyone worth a damn.
[comment]Well because if he puts a number on it he won’t get elected.

Even some of his supporters will be unable to justify raising taxes so much.

Money makes the world go round, and heavy taxes make it so the only people voting for you will be those who want all the benefits of his programs, but are not able to help pay for them.
[comment]Of course not someone introduced deficit spending to the US and the FED found millions of slaves. Slavers gonna slave.
[comment]Is he the me Oprah?  You get free health care and you get free health care?

And we ALL get raped in taxes.
[comment]It's not a "price tag" it's just "taxes."
[comment]Good to know that whether it is sustainable or not isn't even on his mind.
[comment]" Well, you know, I can't rattle off to you every nickel and every dime."

Could you maybe account for every million? No? Every billion? Still no?
[comment]You just pay for it!
[comment]He's not the one who's going to be paying for it, so...
[comment]Bernie is the modern day George McGovern, I hope they do nominate him, he wouldn’t have a prayer
[comment]You can bet it will be paid for by the working middle class!
[comment]His supporters can't see the utter stupidity in all of this because they're all either 1) Young idiots who were thoroughly indoctrinated with extreme Marxist principles in college by radical Leftist professors, or 2) Lazy do nothing scumbag moochers who live off of the government titty, siphoning welfare, disability, section 8, food stamps, medicaid, and utility assistance out of the pockets of hard working Americans when most of them are fully capable of working themselves. They hear this moron spouting off "free" every turn like a human sprinkler and that's all they care about. A third possible option is that they're simply Never Trumpers and they jumped on the Bernie bandwagon because there's not many other choices.
[comment]Doesn’t matter, he still will get the nomination.
[comment]The exact topic I've been trying to bring to their attention in r/politics.. yes I know, liberal echo chamber..  I'm a  glutton for punishment i guess. Keep hoping they will wake up.
[comment]I honestly just don’t understand how so many people can be so naive or just plain stupid. As to the “youth” who follow this man, I have 24 and 26 year old college educated kids. They have both told me they and their friends are horrified at others their age who follow Bernie.

[comment]Is it fair that someone who goes to ten years of school to be a doctor gets paid the same as a fast food worker? Is it fair that I have to share my things with someone else just cause the government says so? Look at China right now, there is genuinely a revolution going on against communism. They want freedom there. Capitalism is the only system where if you work hard you can be successful. With communism you are stuck in the same place with no way of progressing. I don’t care if the rich get richer, good for them. If you can take your wealth and build it then you deserve the wealth you’ve earned. Another thing about communism is higher taxes, how can the government give you that stuff for free, they can’t that’s how
[comment]Let me know how you feel after living in a place that has communism right now. I bet your opinion will have changed
[comment]Medicare for all is fiscally responsible. Everything else I can be skeptical about but I don’t give a fuck who you are, no one and I mean no one should financially take advantage of sick, elderly &amp; unlucky people.

&gt; &amp;quot;Der US-Pr&amp;auml;sident bietet der deutschen Firma angeblich einen hohen Betrag, um sich ihre Arbeit zu sichern. Von einer Milliarde Dollar ist in Berlin die Rede. Besonders problematisch ist: Trump tue alles, um einen Impfstoff f&amp;uuml;r die Vereinigten Staaten zu bekommen. &amp;bdquo;Aber eben nur f&amp;uuml;r die USA&amp;quot;, hei&amp;szlig;t es in der Bundesregierung.

&gt; Der Verkauf einer Firma mit einem &amp;uuml;berlebenswichtigen Medikament sei eine Frage der nationalen Sicherheit, hei&amp;szlig;t es.

&gt; &amp;quot;Darin hei&amp;szlig;t es: &amp;bdquo;Grenzkontrollen sollten zur Bek&amp;auml;mpfung der illegalen Zuwanderung und des Menschenhandels sowie zur Vorbeugung jeglicher Bedrohung der inneren Sicherheit, der &amp;ouml;ffentlichen Ordnung, der &amp;ouml;ffentlichen Gesundheit und der internationalen Beziehungen der Mitgliedstaaten beitragen."

[comment]Yeah, but...

&gt; In June 2018, then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued the president, his son Eric and daughter, Ivanka, along with the Donald J. Drumpf Foundation charity. Underwood [**wrote**](https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2019/10/451130_2018_The_People_of_the_Stat_v_The_People_of_the_Stat_PETITION_1-3.pdf) that:  
&gt;  
&gt;“For more than a decade, the Donald J. Drumpf Foundation has operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities. This pattern of illegal conduct by the Foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.”  
&gt;  
&gt;As a result, Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to “dissolve the Foundation for its persistently illegal conduct, enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not-for-profit authorized by New York law, to obtain restitution and penalties, and to direct the Foundation to cooperate with the Attorney General in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Specifically, the attorney general asked the court to bar the president from running any New York-based charities for 10 years, and the other directors for one year.

[comment]Out of the loop here? Is there any kernel of truth to any of this? Clinton Foundation aside, has the Trump Foundation got into any trouble for misuse of any charitable funds?
[comment](Just under that is this loong text. Tldr: just means even though people may get the details wrong (abt trump stealing from a childrens' charity)), they are pretty close to the truth which is that trump's charity was set up mainly for personal gain)
For more than a decade, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities. This pattern of illegal conduct by the Foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.”

As a result, Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to “dissolve the Foundation for its persistently illegal conduct, enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not-for-profit authorized by New York law, to obtain restitution and penalties, and to direct the Foundation to cooperate with the Attorney General in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities.”

Specifically, the attorney general asked the court to bar the president from running any New York-based charities for 10 years, and the other directors for one year. 

In December 2018, the attorney general and the defendants reached an agreement to dissolve the Trump Foundation and distribute its assets to a list of agreed charities. However, that agreement did not include Underwood’s request that President Trump, along with Eric and Ivanka, be barred from operating a New York-based non-profit organization in the future, for varying periods of time. 

In January 2019, Letitia James took over as New York attorney general and continued the state’s case against the Trumps. On Nov. 7, the state’s Supreme Court published a final resolution of the case, one which did not bareither President Trump or his children Eric and Ivanka, from running charities in the state of New York.

However, President Trump was forced to agree to certain stipulations involving governance, leadership structure and record-keeping, in the event that he wishes to become a non-profit director or board member within the state, in future. As part of the final settlement, Eric and Ivanka Trump were required to undergo (and have already undergone) “an in-person, interactive board training session pertaining to charitable organizations and the fiduciary responsibilities of those organizations’ directors and officers.”

The final resolution of the case, published on Nov. 7, made it clear that the New York Supreme Court had not barred members of the Trump family from operating or running charities within the state, and so this element of the claim contained in Amato’s viral tweet was false. However, it should be emphasized that at the time Amato posted his tweet (Oct. 5), that final resolution had not yet been published, and it was released only after this fact check was published.

When Amato made his claims, a realistic possibility still existed that the court might indeed accept the Attorney General’s request to bar the family members outright from running charities in the state, for various time periods. On that basis, we originally issued a rating of “Mostly False.” However, the case was subsequently resolved without those outright bans being implemented, and therefore we have change the rating to “False.”

Did Trump family members steal from a children’s cancer charity?

The allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children’s cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state.

Amato’s viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general, but not granted by the court) was the result of Trump family members “stealing” from a children’s charity.

Investigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds, funneling money into Trump-owned businesses or other charities linked to the Trump empire. 

The Associated Press, for example, wrote that:

“A charity operated by one of Donald Trump’s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity’s board, an Associated Press investigation shows. The AP found that Eric Trump has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity’s payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump’s private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships …”

Among other claims, the Associated Press alleged that:

— The Eric Trump Foundation failed to report multiple conflicts of interest by supposedly independent board members who work for The Trump Organization or Eric Trump’s winery, as required by the IRS.

— Based on its revenue and giving, the Eric Trump Foundation is a small-to-medium-sized charity. Eric Trump has repeatedly overstated its size. In 2015, for example, he said his group was “one of the largest foundations anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world.” Told of the claim, Associate Dean Patrick Rooney at Indiana University’s Center on Philanthropy said, “That’s just silly.”

— Though public charity boards are supposed to represent the public, Eric Trump has loaded his board with friends, relatives and Trump employees. They include two Trump company executives who served as senior presidential campaign aides: former Westchester golf club manager Dan Scavino and special Trump counsel Michael D. Cohen. The charity’s executive director, Paige Scardigli, was a close college friend of Eric Trump at Georgetown University.

The 2017 Forbes article, which was included in Amato’s widely shared tweet as a source, made similar claims about the operations of the Eric Trump Foundation. Those allegations haven’t been tested in court and have not resulted in any legal action or prosecution.

It should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of “stealing,” as such, with that word being understood in the conventional sense of meaning theft or embezzlement of funds. What is alleged is that the foundation engaged in misleading practices and that it inappropriately used donated funds to pay Trump businesses — practices that could be regarded as “self-dealing,” rather than theft or embezzlement.

In June 2018, a spokesperson for then-New York Attorney General Underwood told the Associated Press that her office had opened an investigation looking specifically at the affairs of the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude’s Research Hospital. We asked the office of Underwood’s successor what the status of that investigation was in October 2019, but we did not receive a response.

[comment]Why did the Democrats lie for 3 years about Russian collusion and obstruction of justice and not impeach the president? Do they take their voters as suckers? Yes
[comment]Obviously the point is to have Trump in the history books as officially impeached and never cleared by the Senate. He clearly isn't going to be removed from office by this. 

One of the few things people 100 years from now will know about Trump is that he was impeached.

Disagreed all you want, but it isn't necessarily a dumb strategy.
[comment]This is the democrats game plan as far as I can tell, they hope to flip the senate sometime in the very near future and then deliver the articles of impeachment when they can win on a party line vote.
[comment]I'll believe all this bluster when I see it. McConnell has disappointed before.
[comment]Good, I wasn’t sure on that
[comment]The way I understand it, Trump isn’t yet impeached by Congress until they officially present the article(s) of impeachment to the Senate. So technically, Trump is still not officially impeached.
[comment]They’re hoping they’ll take the senate in 2020 then remove him when he gets re-elected? Not really sure what crazy Nancy is up to here, other than trying to keep impeachment in the news as long as she can.
[comment]Just look at the Vegas odds. It was -500 that he would get impeached (bet 500 you receive 100) and the odds that’s he’s removed from office are -5000. It’s just comically polar and has nothing to do with bipartisan action.

[comment]- ***Here's the reality. By most traditional measures, the economy is stronger than it's been in over three decades, especially where job creation is concerned. Trump's policy of tax relief and deregulation—the president likes to brag his administration has eliminated more than a dozen regulations for each new one it has imposed—has led to the creation of the three most important things in U.S. politics: jobs, jobs and more jobs. "On a scale of 1 to 10," economist Steve Moore recently wrote of the job market, "it's an 11.***

My 401k has never looked better, and my year end bonus was enough to pay off a debt. Only two more to go! I shouldbe debt free by 2021!
[comment]Wait until the Boomers start retiring. Capital markets will contract significantly and interests rates will go way up. Enjoy this age of free money while it lasts.

Also the stock market is massively inflated due to an overflow of Boomer investments chasing any opportunity they can find. All those stocks will come down considerably and in that process tons of wealth will be lost.

Finally, the real estate market is due for a recession.

On the other hand, shale oil is making us Americans energy independent, and has reduced the cost of natural gas to half that of the rest of the world.
[comment]I don’t think anyone has mentioned the fact that we’re effectively seeing QE4 right now. Is the stock market pumping? Yes. Is that an effect of low unemployment or getting out of “bad trade deals” probably not.

We are doing the same thing we did in 2008 to get out of a depression but now we already have insanely low interest rates and low unemployment. 

Takeaway: if the economy really is so great we probably shouldn’t be massively increasing our money supply. Asset prices like stocks going up (in isolation) doesn’t equal a strong economy and can result in bubbles, recessions, depressions if the economy crashes since we’re using our best measures to prop up markets when times are supposedly good...

[comment]She already plans on rising taxes on guns and ammunition like the communist she is.
[comment]Get Mexico to pay for it!
[comment]The middle  class. They say they will tax the upper class but they wont.
[comment]Taxes. Some of us pay close to 40 to 45% in taxes.  To those who are okay with the tax increase then they should pay for it and not force the rest of us into the disaster that is the government bureaucracy. This is being done at the barrel of a gun. They’re okay with putting some of us into the 70% tax range, they’re okay with killing entire industries so no one can tell me they aren’t willing to push the middle class into the 70% range. I don’t see how this can be a sustainable solution even if they blow up our tax rates. The federal government has shown how incompetent it can be with social security, this would end up becoming insolvent and the only way to pay for it will be with inflation and a reduction in services. 

The poor already get Medicaid and welfare this isn’t about redistribution of wealth, or morality,  it’s about control and creating a huge dependency on the government. America’s healthcare system needs reform but the government is clearly using its glaring deficiencies to completely take control of it. I don’t blame the democrats only because I can see the establishment republicans getting behind something like this as well.
[comment]We can just print it... and crush our own economy
[comment]This conversation just makes my ears steam.  In the broadest sense of the word "money," there's only about 80 trillion dollars **in the entire world.**  And yet, people like Warren think there's some untapped domestic source she can tax 32 trillion from?  She couldn't even get **close** to that number no matter who she raised taxes on!  And Democrats damn sure can't get enough to cover a health care plan like this as well as all the other multi-trillion dollar plans they have.

This is Democrats preying on the ignorant.  People think that just because someone like Sanders or Warren says they'll tax the rich to get 32 trillion dollars that there must actually be 32 trillion dollars out there that is collectible.  It never occurs to them that there isn't, and since Democrats and their media allies do their dead level best to convince their base of ignoramuses that Republicans are dishonest about everything it's impossible to educate people as to the facts.

So, that's where we're at.  Democrats promising what is mathematically impossible to deliver, ignorant masses believing anyone who tells them it's mathematically impossible must be a liar, and a country already up to its eyeballs in debt and deficits completely unable to fix anything.  

And that right there is the problem with the Democratic Party.  They aren't actually interested in fixing anything.  They are only interested in power.  It doesn't matter what gets broken.  It doesn't even matter if there's a country left to govern.  As long as they have whatever power there is left to have, then everything has gone according to plan.  Their voters all believe that they are pursuing a vision of a better country, one that's more in line with their values.  They aren't really, but they don't realize that.  They don't grasp that these 30+ trillion dollar ideas can never be done.  They don't grasp that tossing out due process for some will eventually mean it gets tossed for everyone.  They honestly believe that Democrat politicians are their saviors and that Republicans are an evil enemy that needs to be crushed.  And not a damn one of them will come into this sub to prove me wrong.  The only ones that respond will be the usual triggered grenade lobbers, which will only prove my point.  You can tell that this is how it's going due to how Democrats become enraged at people like Alan Dershowitz for supporting due process and fairness or the way they attacked Ellen Degeneres for daring to be friends with a former Republican president.

They truly are beyond help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Democrats Know They're Losing the Impeachment Battle With the Public
[selftext]https://pjmedia.com/trending/top-democrats-concede-theyre-losing-the-impeachment-battle/[comment]We do? News to me.
[comment]Pelosi certainly knows it. I wonder if she knew that handing over impeachment to a mendacious clown like Schiff would end up this way.
[comment]This so far as been a disaster for the dems
[comment]and it still won't matter. They knew it was a bad idea before it even happened and they STILL did it.
[comment]That... that is not at all what the original news story said.
[comment]The Dems spent a lot of political capital on impeachment. So they have to deliver.

If they don't impeach the President, then J Q Normal American will think that they spent all this time and money on impeachment and the President don't break the law? You wasted 3 years for nothing? Republicans can run against the do nothing Democrats who only want to waste time on impeachment instead of putting Americans back to work.

The Dems will be in trouble with their base. Democratic voters think they have the President red handed. And the Dems don't impeach? Forget it. Many will be disillusioned and stay home in 2020. Rabid voters in NYC or LA will vote but the average Democratic voter in battleground states might stay home. Who knows, if they are mad enough, maybe they will put in a protest vote for the Green Party.
[comment]I think theres some legitimate questions that can be asked about things over trumps presidency, but none that are impeachable.

This impeachment inquiry is just a joke and anyone who doesn't recognize that is apart of the problem. Understand, that none of the testimonies are first hand accounts. Its people hearing a story, after it'd been through 6 other people, all stemming from a person who didnt hear or see, but instead they "presumed"

Its fine to hate trump, by all means have at it. It's not fine to destroy innocent peoples lives, waste tax payer dollars, and completely ignore the constitution, just to continue throwing shit at the wall, hoping something sticks, not caring what rules are broken along the way.

 Following an outbreak of smallpox in Boston, Washington took further precautions to protect his men; he quarantined his men from the dangerous Boston public.

[comment]REPORTER: I wanted to ask you specifically about one industry in particular, and that’s food-processing plants. Is there a priority to get testing at food-processing plants all across the country?

TRUMP: "Well, you’re asking that because of what happened — it’s a fair question, too — what happened in Denver. Because in Denver, I’ve never seen — I said, ‘What’s going on?’ We’re looking at this graph where everything’s looking beautiful and it’s coming down and then you got this one spike. It’s — I said, ‘What happened to Denver?’

“And many people, very quickly, and they — by the way, they were on it like, so fast, you wouldn’t believe it. They knew every aspect. They had people go and — not only testing, ‘Who did you see? Where were you? How many people did you meet? Were you out to dinner in somebody else’s home? Where were you?’ Where did — where did this number of people come from? How did — they are totally on it.

“Now, this just happened. I just saw it this morning. I’m looking at everything smooth, going down, topping out. And then you have this one spike in Denver. It’s like, where did this come from?

“So we’ll be looking at that. And we don’t want cases like that happening. This was — but this — this is the kind of thing can happen. This is very complex.

“This is a very brilliant enemy. You know, it’s a brilliant enemy. They develop drugs like the antibiotics. You see it. Antibiotics used to solve every problem. Now one of the biggest problems the world has is the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can’t keep up with it. And they’re constantly trying to come up with a new — people go to a hospital and they catch — they go for a heart operation — that’s no problem, but they end up dying from — from problems. You know the problems I’m talking about. There’s a whole genius to it.

“We’re fighting — not only is it hidden, but it’s very smart. Okay? It’s invisible and it’s hidden, but it’s — it’s very smart. And you see that in a case like a Denver.

“But, you know, I think we’re doing well, and they’re on Denver like you wouldn’t believe. I came in this morning; it was a flurry. I said what’s going on? They said, ‘Denver.’ I said, ‘What happened to Denver?’ Because Denver was doing pretty well. And they’ve got that under control. But, yeah, that would be a case where you do some very big testing."

<|startoftext|>[title]'I think a lot of people cheat': Trump dismisses expanded mail-in voting during coronavirus outbreak
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-think-a-lot-of-people-cheat-trump-dismisses-expanded-mail-in-voting-during-coronavirus-outbreak[comment]100000000% TRUE AND RIGHT 

If you disagree you are probably a Democrat who relies on ballot harvesting and other election meddling methods.

Voter ID and go to a designated voting center. Don't like it? Then GTFO!!!
[comment]We have much higher instances if election fraud than voter fraud.
[comment]Can't we already vote by absentee ballot?
[comment]This should be a State issue, not something mandated by the Feds.
[comment]Seems like the party continues this propaganda of supposed “cheaters”. The ideology that everyone is a cheater or cheats the system, when in reality it’s probably a very very low percent that does. This kind of mentality punishes those that don’t and halts us from moving forward together as a society.
[comment]All voters should prove citizenship, eligibility to vote in the area they are voting and show id.   It’s quite basic and simple.  International observers including from the US monitor other country elections and these are basic elements required everywhere.   Why not in the US?
[comment]I don’t see any issue with mail-in voting with required social security number verification.  Obviously we have to make sure dead people aren’t voting but that should be easy enough.
[comment]Projection-based-decisions will get us nowhere.

Let's see some data and create a modern system of voting that's accessible and secure. Christ.
[comment]Two words: bloc chain...
[comment]"I think a lot of people cheat" seems to normally be something cheaters say. What does he mean here?  I'm confused
[comment]Just like he said on Fox News, if it was mail-in ballots, he knows he would lose.
[comment]It's hard to parse out the exaggeration and negativity anymore but I just want to point out a few things that are implied here that nobody has mentioned yet.
1. He is undermining the security of the Postal Service which is a federal agency under the Executive branch. Undermining the Intelligence Departments, Military, and USPS is unacceptable for a president but especially befuddled when this one is under his direct purveyors. If he thought it was ran fraudulently, why not fix it earlier?
2. He seems to be proposing we all go out and crown public buildings for hours on end to vote. This again is against the recommendations of the WHO, CDC, AND Dr. Fauci.
3.  Isn't it just really embarrassing to read anything he says when it is typed out verbatim? Like, future school children are gonna a reason this and be like, "why don't I understand what that President was saying? Is this some bizarr-o version of Shakespeare?"
[comment]The States will figure this out for themselves. This isn't a federal issue.

Beyond that, the Electoral College is the final review on cheating. Strictly speaking, the popular election process is little more than a representative sampling process.

The primaries matter and they're utterly fucked up in process. The general election is far less important.

And yes, every election has fraud both concentrated and widespread. Anecdotal, but the last time I voted there were college aged women looking to check whether IDs were being required before voting. If they were required, they were going to head to another polling place but given that we don't check in our state, they went in and, as Democrats presumably, voted for Clinton. I ignored it, and it didn't matter. My state went to Trump, so their fake votes were immaterial.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Why?
[comment]This is a partisan subreddit, so I'm just going to throw my two cents out there. I don't think anyone really wants to change the structure of the economy for the worse. If anyone supports ideals that they themselves believe is bad, they are neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but something else entirely. The truth is, everyone just wants to be successful and live comfortably, people just have different versions of what "success" and "comfort" are, and there are literally infinity different ways to achieve these goals. Instead of polarizing two different political ideologies, more people should be focused on the things we CAN agree on, the things that are good for every individual. We will never solve the problems plaguing our society if we continue to convince ourselves that there is no philosophical common ground between two groups of people who experience the exact same societal constraints.

[comment]
California’s budget woes are many. I believe Pete Wilson issued IOU warrants in the early 90’s. CA later issued tax returns in in the form of an IOU in 2009.

Prior to Brown, the “Governator” did the furlough thing. It was a novel approach to the crisis of the time. Furloughs only kicked the can down the road with agencies that operated 24 hours a day. Employees within those agencies still worked and received credit in lue of pay for ten then later fifteen percent of their pay. This allowed some classifications to earn overtime while covering furloughed positions. Those furlough credits would later be used before vacation banks and allowed for excessive banks to be accumulated. So it ended up just costing taxpayers years later. 

When Governor Brown was in office, he made changes to the pension system to end some of the abuses that were talked about in this article. Brown ended the “spiking” and later ended some of the better paid pensions that older public safety employees have. Fortunately for California, prop 58 “ the rainy day fund” was born during Browns term. I’ll give him credit for two good things. 

On to the highly paid public employees; those making $250k+. I’d agree some of the positions mentioned received exceptionally generous salaries. As for the cops and firefighters, well I really don’t have an issues paying them a wage commensurate with the risk level they take on. I’ve even be willing to pay our k-12 teachers more. We rely on these teachers to provide our children with the building blocks that will become the foundation for further education, but we expect them to do it on the cheap. Oddly enough paying our sports figures millions is fine for our entertainment. 

Is California’s pension system ideal, maybe not. But if we leave the emotion out of it, it’s not the public employees fault we’re in this predicament. We should continue to fix things were not happy with moving forward, not look for a quick fix at the expense of the average public employee who is really underpaid compared to their private sector equivalent. 

Is it time for a recall like we did with Gray Davis in our last crisis. Check Newsom in his path? This is his springboard for the presidential run in 2024 or later.

[comment]It looks like many states have issues with unfunded pensions. 

Here is the from a 2019 report by [TexasPolicy](https://www.texaspolicy.com/5-2-trillion-of-government-pension-debt-threatens-to-overwhelm-state-budgets-taxpayers/)

1.	Alaska
2.	California 
3.	Connecticut 
4.	Illinois 
5.	Arkansas 
6.	Hawaii
7.	Ohio
8.	New Jersey 
9.	Nevada
10. New Mexico 

A more comprehensive 2017 report from Pew can be found [here](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/06/the-state-pension-funding-gap-2017).

This report has a per state chart in Appendix B. 

IMO we need serious pension reform nationwide but one of the first steps has to be eliminating abuses of the system like double dipping.

Ideally, we would end state pensions programs and just put money into employee’s individually directed 401k. 

There should be parity between how companies provide for employees and how the government provides for them.
[comment]It’s income redistribution that the government does under the radar
[comment]this is why 14$ for minimum wage is effecting is even if we don’t live in cali. we pay for the inflation of that liberal hell hole.

[comment]Fuck 'em - doesn't matter one iota what they say after he's acquitted as he won't be removed from office and he'll continue to be president. Pelosi and co. will continue to spout their nonsense that he's not truly acquitted because the senate trial didn't get run the way they wanted it to. And anyone with half a brain will dismiss that with a wave and the world will continue to turn.

They chose this gambit, rammed it through in record time and so far it's turned out pretty much exactly as everyone expected. Now we just need to wait and see what the political fallout will be for Democratic party, because instead of damaging Trump's voter support and fundraising it's done the exact opposite.
[comment]This is what happens when everyone gets a participation trophy.  People just can’t loose gracefully.  

No witnesses?  No documentation?  Wasn’t that the House’s job to present all of that?
[comment]To be fair, they still think Stacy Abrams is the governor of Georgia.
[comment]They still can't accept the fact half the country didn't want a Clinton; especially Hillary.  It wouldn't matter which one of the 17 were running and won the spot, if they had beaten Hillary, they would be doing this to them.  It's so disheartening how childish these people area.   JMO
[comment]Who gives a shit what they will accept?  They still haven't accepted the results of the last election.  Fuck these clowns.
[comment]Leave it to a democrat to not understand no means no.
[comment]What are they going to do? Overthrow the senate?
[comment]Of course they won’t, anytime they lose something they think it’s rigged. If liberals are so smart than how do they lose all the time?
[comment]Of course they won’t.  This crap will never stop until the Democrats have to face some consequences for their shady mob boss actions.
[comment]Why would they?  Physically grownup school children with no ability to accept that the American people “moved their cheese” in 2016.
[comment]I don't accept the impeachment articles as legitimate.
[comment]big surprise. Since when do liberals accept or listen to anything they don't like. At least they can't physically assault anyone directly over it.

[comment]The senate shall have the sole power.......
[comment]Of course they wont lol. It's their way or the high way. Fuck them. I'm so tired of the u godly amount of bullshit that comes from them
[comment]Democracy to a DemoKKKrat is only considered democracy if they win. 

Just remember, they were the ones saying "it's not rigged, you're just losing" but then 180'd that shit and decided because they lost then it must be rigged. Fair elections don't mean shit to them.
[comment]Just remember folks when responding to a liberal, always end your posts with 

MAGA 2020 and Trump is still YOUR President -  triggers them!!
[comment]I can’t stand r/politics. Always getting notifications about radical left posts from kids who don’t know any better. To me the Democrats are insane, why can’t more people see that.
[comment]Are they serious, this has long since passed childish tantrums at this point.
[comment]As long as Republicans don’t mimic these same sore loser tactics I can stand 100% firm with our party but sadly history does show times when we often say similar things after a loss.  Granted it’s nowhere near as prevalent and extreme as the current left.  I get the what goes around comes around mentality but we should def try to do it in a way that doesn’t make us look like a bunch of hypocritical asses ya know?

[comment]Our Republican party made this legal by pushing for the Citizens United case.
[comment]I point of clarification, does the gov give $ to PP or do they pay for services rendered by PP? If the former, I can see some concern about shifted revenue allocations. But, if it is payment, then this no diff. than Lockheed or Raytheon using Gov contract  monies to lobby and fund campaigns.

People believe what they want to believe.  This is why Ultra Right Wingers &amp; Liberals, in general, are governed by emotion. They are susceptible to guilt shaming or hatred. Its why Virtue Signalling is so prevalent.

Its not unlike Conspiracy Theorists, or Fundamentalist Religions.  You HAVE to believe in sketchy data, and dismiss inconvenient data.  Wishful thinking.

The Democrats and Wall Street are not working for you, they are working for the Chinese Communist Party.

Wall Street is the modern-day slave boat owners of old.  They have modernized slavery using the Chinese Communist Party as the plantation owner to provide the slave labour for their profits.  Instead of moving the slaves to the factories they simply moved all the factories out of Western Democracies to Communist China, to the slaves.

socalist media publisher run by communists staffed by cultists funded by the oil kingdoms all for the benefit of the Chinese Communist Party and Soros Open Society Foundation's Open Border project.

They don't want the gravy train to end. That is why they lie. That is why they are more than willing to murder every American every Westerner, destroy every Western nation. 

For the money.

The Chinese knew that they are held responsible for the pandemic of *COVID19* *Coronavirus.* The Chinese knew that they are held responsible for the death of their people but also the death of the *American* people. 

Chinese scientists have stolen the virus from the laboratory in *Canada* or the *United States of America* but then took it back to China. However, they have upgraded but weaponized the Coronavirus(Which is also known as 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, nCov, 2019 Novel Coronavirus) which I believe what has caused the *Global Pandemic* of [***COVIDー19***](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID%E3%83%BC19?src=hashtag_click) *(*[***Coronavirus***](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coronavirus?src=hashtag_click)***)*** and it is definitely have no control.
[comment]Jesus Christ the racism and bigotry here is unreal. Then again that's what I get from briefing this subreddit.

The entire article is built around the *opinion* that China is lying about their statistics. Where the proof? None. Literally just an opinion from a conservative Trump-worshipping newspaper.

I welcome your downvotes with an open arm.
[comment]They have brought us to our knees cost the globe untold amounts of money and death and never fired a shot. Seems like the money spent by all nations on defense is pretty much a joke any military can’t stop this kind of shit.

[comment]Italy more than likely is not lying and other countries whose information we have access to are in the same boat. We can compare our data to theirs and then come up with a baseline. Then run that against what China reported and likely determine the actual truth. We are behind them as are other countries. Time will tell and the analysis will become available. 

And yes, China lied to the world. Although their draconian technology that includes facial recognition puts them in a superior position to control their people, and thus the virus.
[comment]Chinese investors own 80% of Hollywood, from real estate to production studios such as Dick Clark Productions, AMC Theaters, etc. and heavily finance many movies and shows we watch.
[comment]Wait I don't understand.  Even this article only claims that China lied in Jan not months.  Specifically they only lied from Dec 30 to Jan 8.  I'm not saying that the Chinese statistics are true now because they probably aren't but it isn't helpful to lie about what China lied about.
[comment]They should also bann using Zoom as soon as possible. The company's CEO is Chinese and they allegedly send personal data to the Chinese government, the biggest threat to everything America stands for.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/aoc-illegal-immigrants-should-fill-out-2020-census[comment]Can we deport her?  PLEASE!!!!
[comment]The census isn’t ment only for US citizens, but everyone living in the United States. So yes, they should fill it out.
[comment]Yeah, I hate AOC, and I am a conservative, but the census is for every living adult in America.  The problem is, without a question about citizenship, this could affect how representatives are apportioned in Congress, and California doesn’t deserve more votes simply because they let anyone squat in their streets and shit on their sidewalks.
[comment]HOw is it legal to incite others to do this? Like when Obama was asked if illegal immigrants could vote...he gave an indirect answer "Well ,...the sanctity of the vote...it's strictly confidential" 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_43-8--bPns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_43-8--bPns)

HOw is this possible or legal?
[comment]Does the Census ask if the people are citizens? Or did the Democrats succeed in hiding the number of invaders?
[comment]Deport her and those who voted for her.
[comment]She's an idiot, what the hell is she doing in Congress. Hopefully this horseface gets voted out.
[comment]Fill it out so we can find them of course
[comment]AOC is probably the dumbest person we have ever had in government and that says a lot
[comment]It should be okay to fill out the census for them just to get an accurate count for the US, but do NOT count them for apportioning districts as California does NOT deserve more seats because they let any person in.
[comment]This is retarded. I get that they *should* fill it out, but we should've passed Amendments ages ago declaring that illegals should not be counted when dividing up congressional house districts
[comment]I love that AOC exists. She's like a satire of modern-day leftists. She's so overtly rediculous that she and her ideologies loose all credibility. She's more destructive to leftist identity politics than any Republican or Moderate ever could be.
[comment]She wants them to be deported by the droves. Just so she can compare our legal system to the horrors of what Hitler and those National Socialists did.
[comment]Guys I had an idea.  What if we paid a few million people from very poor countries to live in red states for a short while and have them fill out the census then leave.

They’d be happy to be paid and to be in America for a while, and it’ll boost our congressional seats in those areas.

^This ^is ^what ^the ^democrats ^are ^doing

[selftext]https://spectator.org/its-columbus-day-not-indigenous-peoples-day/[comment]LoL,,,can't you come up with a better name than that!? 

Let's celebrate The Indigenous Peoples' Day!  Sorry, that name selection is dead on arrival.
[comment]Aww. Someone sounds triggered :(
[comment]Happy Columbus Day!
[comment]I sometimes wonder what this land would look like had Columbus never bravely sailed across the ocean.

The stories of the “indigenous” people don’t always point to a gracious and all loving people. They were hunter gatherers while European cultures had progressed nearly into the Industrial Age by the time they had reached the new world.
[comment]I side on the indigenous people day on this one. We are “celebrating” Columbus Day under absolutely no merit. He didn’t discover America. There is proof that others had been here before, and obviously the Native American people already lived here. It’s a stupid holiday that should have never been implemented.
[comment]Very good article
[comment]C. Columbus, first open boarder SJW.
[comment]I don’t think Columbus deserves to have a holiday named after him because he didn’t really do much besides slaughter and destroy a culture, but Indigenous People’s day is so stupid
[comment]Did this get brigaded? Columbus was a total asshole who raped and murdered American Indians, but is he not celebrated because without him our nation would not be where it is today? The Indigenous People did not found the nation, Europeans did. Why would we celebrate someone who contributed nothing to the nation?
[comment]I own a manufacturing company and gave my 17 employees the day off!  Although I am sure my sales guys won't ....

Our email said "Happy Columbus Day!"

I had one of our two office assistants email me and say "It is indigenous day"

I actually "replied to all" forwarding it to everyone in my company letting them now that they are getting off for Columbus day, NOT indigenous people day.

Whatever that is....

I look forward to her shutting up or quitting, either is fine with me
[comment]I was at the gym this morning in my town that is full of SJW’s and left class to observe a sixty something woman chewing out the gym clerk because the class trainer called today Columbus Day. She was so offended she claimed she almost had to leave. Unbelievable!
[comment]No shit.
[comment]I don’t care at all how the day is called and we should stop arguing about it.
[comment]While I care less about the holiday, I do think it's unfortunate so many want to remove monuments / artifacts nowadays. 

We bring our kids to these kinds of things and it's a great learning experience. Stuff I didn't know about too, like that the nearby liberal elite school was built with slave money. But you gotta read the little plaques..
[comment]No one is indigenous to the Americas. Who does the proposed holiday celebrate?
[comment]The thing I find most disturbing is that most people seem to think American Indians were exactly like Na’Vi from Avatar. Native Americans were brutal to the extreme, they conquered others land, raped, pillaged, scalped, tortured, sacrificed en masse, had slavery. Let’s not pretend that they were a peace loving people who were one with nature. They weren’t.
[comment]Columbus did not discover the Americas. He wasn't even the second person to find it. millions of people already knew about the Americas before him. columbus was responsible for shit tons of racism which caused thousands of casualties and many more lives in poverty or working as slaves for rich snobs. Fuck columbus day.
[comment]It's just a holiday so I dont really care. I think having columbus day is good just for educational history purposes. Like everyone knows Christopher Columbus in the US. I think the reasons for removing Columbus because he committed "genocide" as if the Aztecs were not sacrificing a quarter of a million slaves is weak. Why not have both holidays? A indigenous peoples day to appreciate the original inhabitants of this country makes sense. Having it replace Columbus day I think is unwarranted.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://100percentfedup.com/politicized-media-ignores-obama-pandemic-that-killed-12469-americans-media-criticizes-trumps-incredible-effort-to-curb-coronavirus/[comment]The funniest (funny peculiar, not hilarious) was hearing what Ron Klain, the ex Ebola Tzar under Obama and current Mississippi state health director, had to say in a hearing in Congress what a "fiasco" the Trump administration's efforts had been....and how wonderfully Obama handled Ebola.

For goodness sake, can't compare a pandemic (Trump's challenge) with a few cases of Ebola in the USA. Moreover, we went to Africa, all suited up, put those 11 patients in negative pressure isolation capsules and carried them back to the USA in air ambulances that then delivered them to specialized units to be treated. The only place that had no such protections (treating 1 African man in Texas) led to the infection of 2 Americans. The infectiousness of Ebola is way lower than that of COVID19. We knew what those 11 people had, and Ebola is a very lethal and very well known virus. And yes, the USA outstandingly helped in West Africa to end the Ebola epidemic, but we had plenty of help from many countries and Docs without Borders in handling the gigantic number of cases.

In the case of COVID19 we're facing thousands, hundreds of thousands (probably) potential cases of infection with a totally unknown virus, and a completely unknown disease for which nobody on earth is immune and the treatment of which we (humanity) have had no experience treating or even seeing before. The long incubation period has taken everybody everywhere in the world by surprise, with countries facing sudden explosions in the number of infected people. Nobody can help anybody, because everybody is taking care of their own, and justly so.

We don't have such advantages or low with COVID-19.

This guy should be replaced with someone with more objective, less apocalyptic and less partisan mind. Partisanship and uneven comparisons (like those that compared COVID19 with the flu) help no one. They're only wasting time and obstructing the efforts and positive spirit needed to fight this darn virus. 

Here's what Mr Klain said:

[comment]Donald Trumps efforts have been incredible. Very incredible efforts indeed. Definitely the most incredible efforts any administration has ever taken. Ever.
[comment]Anyone with eyes could see what this virus was capable of. Yet tonight the media is talking about how we may not have enough beds. Why wasn't that issue thought of back in January? Same with test kits. It's March. Test kits should have been a priority back before the virus was here. Yes, it was great that Trump stopped flights from China. But I'm wondering if the administration really believed that was going to be sufficient to deal with this.

And yes, the media is ignoring the fact that Obama had to deal with a flu. But honestly, that flu seems to be an order of magnitude less dangerous than COVID 19.
[comment]This post is why people hate us.
[comment]Politics continues, folks.  The media is weaponizing this virus... while many of us would prefer the high ground, I have a hard time faulting folks for pointing out hypocrisy.

[comment]I’m a conservative and in no way a fan of Biden.  Rape is too strong an allegation and sensationalizing this by exaggeration does not help.  The nature of his unwanted forced SEXUAL ASSAULT is sensational enough.  Don’t discount your point by calling it rape.

Was an adult. Was a senator. Got her fired. Ruined her career. Penetrated her. Told her she was nothing.
[comment]I stand corrected not long ago the definition was intercourse.   This is from justice dept website, it has recently been updated:  “The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”   So it didn’t meet the definition at the time but would today.<|endoftext|>

[comment]The Left is pushing out the opinions of a man who would end the riots overnight if you gave him a division of US Marines. Sure, he would burn the hearts out the Democrat cities, but that is Mattis's style.

The Left is putting a military man's moods and desires above the civilian leadership that is part and parcel of the US Constitution. 

The Left will do anything, short of telling the truth, if it would damage America.

[comment]The loons over at r/politics think that voting for Bernie is how you keep Russia from getting what they want.

“In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.”

Damn this is why I hate so many politicians!!

Told Russia is helping, turns it around to say that the not helpful stuff is probably "The Russians".  

I guess he must be literally shaking.

California: SaVe ThE FiSh!! /s
[comment]You guys understand that alot of this water is going to vineyards and cash crops not food right?
Like I'm all for proper water sourcing but a huge reàson why California set up water standards is shortages and those shortages are in a large part do to water waste or cash crop usage that doesn't lower food prices.
[comment]California state wishes are traitorous against the United States
[comment]As a resident of the Central Valley, thanks you Trump. Don’t judge all of us by the actions of SF, Sac and LA.
[comment]Ca is really unhinged these days. Its sad, I once spent a lot of time on the west coast, now you cant pay me to live there

Trump’s order comes as the state has taken several steps to deal with the water scarcity that has lasted for decades.

*“It would be different if you had a drought,” Trump claimed, despite concerns the state may be headed into another drought. “You don’t have a drought. You have tremendous amounts of water.”
The state is expected to fight the order.*
[comment]General Etc needs to stop whining about finger fish. Farmers need that water. Good job again President Trump.
[comment]Sacramento doesn’t was CA to grow any crops.
[comment]Isn't this literally a state issue?
[comment]California is the largest food producer in the country. It is of vital national security interest that the farmers get water.
[comment]Can someone please explain to me why California would put the lives of a few fish over a farmer's ability to produce food for this country? Honestly don't understand.
[comment]So the Brawndo wasn't working?
[comment]The biggest thing here is the relaxation of rules around fish that were considered "pressured", though not threatened or endangered.  The state water projects will now have the option to divert more water for use by humans rather than dumping it out into the ocean.

The federally controlled Central Valley Project can do so immediately.

Good news for Californians.
[comment]Democrats wanted to control water on farms. Trump diverts water to farms. 
Checkmate
[comment]Honestly Commiefornia has some truly stupid water rights laws. The Resnicks are a great example. They were basically given all the water in a back room deal. Then those dumb farmers go an plant crap like pistachios which drink up a ton of water. They're all so stupid.
[comment]Non American here:

Why are the democratic states so poorly run? Are they seriously considering sabotaging one of the best regions on the planet for fruit and vegetables growth for the sake of saving a species of fish?

A state saturated in sun with large room for farming but no water to stop a species of fish going extinct? How about collect some of those fish and move the species somewhere else if your concerned about it’s survival.

We would kill for that weather over in Ireland to grow all types of produce, what a waste. It doesn’t help that the state has a waste collection problem, drug problem and is one of the largest open air mental asylums in the world.

Yeah great idea we will have a diverse range of all the fish but we won’t have any food ourselves not unlike that PhD who said we should exterminate ourselves to save the planet, pathological altruism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Fact Check: No, Trump Didn't Propose Injecting People with Disinfectant
[selftext]https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/04/23/fact-check-no-trump-didnt-propose-injecting-people-with-disinfectant/[comment]It is not only BAD that multiple outlets are misreporting on this, it's journalistic malpractice.

Let me explain. We all know that Trump isn't a doctor. At no point has he ever claimed to be a doctor. Yes... he touts his intellect a lot, but he's not a doctor. However, he's meeting with LOTS of doctors right now and they are likely discussing MANY possible treatments.

For the media to claim that Trump has said people should inject themselves with disinfectant is DANGEROUS.

Consider this. When he talked about "hydroxychloroquine" (because there had been reports of positive impacts from it) and some dude died because he took (or was given) fish tank cleaner...they blamed Trump. They said Trump had blood on his hands because this dude died from taking fish cleaner.

Considering that they think Trump has the magical power to induce people to do the things that he suggests....WHY would they misreport this and say that he suggested injecting "disinfectant".

If someone DOES to it and dies or has adverse effects, that will be the fault of the MEDIA and not Trump.

Here's what he said after a doctor talked about what kills the virus. Sunlight and isopropyl alcohol are best and a lab is studying that...the virus in secretions, Trump asks the doctor, talking about all of this research and what it means...

"Can I ask a question because some of you are wondering...supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it's UV or powerful light and I think you said that hasn't been checked but you are going to test it and suppose you get the light inside the body and you said you are going to check that and about the disinfectant can you do something with that injection inside or with a cleaning in the lungs because it gets inside the lungs and you said that the lab's going to check that..."

So this isn't Trump saying, "INJECT YOURSELF WITH DISINFECTANT"...this is Trump recounting the conversation he had with the doctor regarding where their TESTING is going to go next in light of their FINDINGS about how sunlight and disinfectant kills the virus....

Anyone saying otherwise is a lying moron.
[comment]So to sum it up, he did say it.  But he didn't mean it because no one could be that stupid... Got it.
[comment]Real responsible guy right there announcing such a stupid thing to the whole world. Lol, is there anything we can really just admit “yeah, he shouldn’t of done that” or are we gonna cover for him forever. I’ll go ahead and save everyone some time and answer my own question on behalf of this sub. “ yes, we will never admit he was ever in the wrong.” I’m sure you guys would disagree with something your favorite person in your life has said once before, why would you literally never disagree with or have so much blind loyalty to a politician lol. And for the “ThAt’S NoT wHaT hE sAiD!” Or “iT’S mEdiA twIstInG hIs WoRdS” crowd....it’s on video. He’s not your uncle saying something he’s not informed on that has zero impact, this is the president of the united states who has influence of health care policy and his influence has impact on the direction that testing and treatments are done for hundreds of millions. He suggested it as being something they should test, something that is inarguably already tested as not safe and something that would not work by any stretch, and that’s common knowledge. Not only did he expose himself as lacking this common knowledge but a large part of his base (already seeing it) will probably believe this is an actual cure that scientists won’t give credit to and further their misguided distrust of health professionals.
[comment]whether or not he outright suggested it, people will take it as a suggestion and it may be one of the absolute stupidest things a president has ever said out loud in a room with both air and other people in it. there isn't a way to mis-report what he said: just watch him say it. "sunlight into the body", "injecting disinfectant". those were objectively stupid things to say.
[comment]Um he did. Don’t need to twist into a pretzel to defend everything dumb thing he says.
[comment]Republican mental gymnastics lol
[comment]Do you have a source that isn't extremely biased?
[comment][Here is the video] of the expert talking and then Trump returning to make his now infamous comments. He comes back on at about 27:45 minutes.

He was merely asking the expert about possible treatments and asking for them to be studied. Now is it kinda silly or uninformed to think that disinfectant in the body is a good idea? Probably, but he was putting it to the experts, deferring to them, and asking about other treatments

It does sound kinda silly and ignorant when he asked it, but we don't ask our presidents to be medical experts, we ask them to lead, encourage, and delegate important tasks to capable individuals. He did all of that in this exchange.<|endoftext|>

[comment]The AB5 Bill consequences are showing exactly what Democrats have said would never happen to bills like this. 

“Small businesses are not going to fire employees or increase the cost of products even if you make it more expensive to have employees on staff.” 

I’ve heard a version of that phrase over and over when talking about bills that force small businesses to have higher expenses. The problem is that small businesses have to make money or they will have to close their doors and even if they are really nice people, it usually means other really nice people losing their jobs. 

The AB5 bill will give a small number of employees better benefits and higher wages, but it will also mean higher costs of products and a lot of people out of work. That state will need years and years of deregulation before small businesses have a chance to survive.
[comment]Simple thing that everyone saw coming with special interest politics that dems always play: once we are in we have an agenda, and that agenda will not suffer because it goes against the will of the people.

<|startoftext|>[title]GOP rightly blocked Nancy Pelosi’s mail-in-balloting nonsense
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/gop-rightly-blocked-nancy-pelosis-mail-in-balloting-nonsense[comment]Oregon has mail in voting and has one of the highest voter turnout rates in the country. We vote in EVERY election because it just comes to your mailbox. No lines, no waiting. Plus, there is a paper trail of who voted with no digital mistakes.
[comment]They're just going to keep trying until one day they successfully sneak it in. "Never let a good crisis go to waste."
[comment]A big concern in this thread seems to be duplicate ballots, where someone who is a citizen in one state and a resident of another receives a ballot for each state. However, why would a person get two ballots though, if they are only registered to vote in one state? (Excluding, of course, very serious clerical errors)

Edit: grammar
[comment]The mail-in-balloting would help people avoid congested areas, which should help people avoid the virus. It should also help with overall voting turnout. I get that maybe it shouldn't have been in the relief bill, but could someone enlighten me as to why mail-in-balloting would be bad?
[comment]I helped my grandma vote by mail and the vote people called to confirm it was actually her that voted bc her signature has degraded so much.

I trust mail in voting way more than electronic voter booths.  Paper trail baby.
[comment]Why are republicans against this? Assuming they fear the voter fraud issues?
[comment]Key points in the article:

Pelosi wanted to include $4 Billion to mandate that all states implement the same universal mail balloting system. 
Republicans wanted to give $400 million while giving the States the freedom to decide how the money would be spent to help their states election system.

Both sides want to help the people vote during this trying time. They are taking a different road to the same destination. 

In my humble opinion, now is not the time to pass legislation that will fundamentally change our American systems we just need to prop up the American People during this temporary epidemic.
[comment]Screw mail in ballotting. Let’s just declare Election Day a holiday so that the poor who can’t take time of otherwise will be able to do so.
[comment]Why do Democrats think voting is so hard. In Canada you have to provide two pieces of ID or one and a voter card at a polling station.

[comment]Governor "Nipples" Cuomo had a significant number of dead with his stupid stupid order to put the infected into vulnerable nursing homes.
[comment]The uneven impact reflects the disproportionate toll the infectious disease has taken in densely packed Democratic-voting cities like New York. Rural areas and far-flung suburbs that typically back Republicans have not seen as direct an impact.
[comment]This thing breaks out in tight, indoor areas, with shared ventilation.... sounds like New Yorkers should be hanging out at the parks and not in their studios.
[comment]This is trying to make it sound like the outbreaks are republican vs Democrat when in reality it’s urban vs rural. Don’t be dumb
[comment]Ty god
[comment]Yeah this isn’t telling me anything everyone doesn’t already know. Yes, highly populated areas spread the virus at a higher rate.
[comment]Who would have thought densely populated areas would spread an airborne infectious disease? Crazy! /s This kind of garbage helps no one.
[comment]Well larger cities, more homelessness, tend to be democrat. And they also have larger populations squeezed into smaller areas. Naturally it would hit harder
[comment]I’m so proud that people here are smart enough to know that this is stupid. It’s rural vs urban, until there are statistics that democratic policies are the cause for the impact, their fate is the same as ours.
[comment]This could also help explain the Democrat va Republican divide on the issue.
[comment]I love the fact our little Conservative corner of the world calls out bullshit, regardless if it's a "pro conservative" or "anti leftist". 

Bullshit is bullshit.  Fake news is fake news.  

It's refreshing to converse with folks who don't let tribalism overcome basic objectivity.  The Reddit "unbiased" political subs are the polar opposite, and the leftist subs seem to support **any** bullshit, no matter how clearly fake/bogus/biased.

I lean to the right because it best fits my belief system.  I'm more than dismayed that so many of our fellow Americans, pick a political party because it seems to sound good, then spend the rest of their life absorbing their belief system as handed down by their political party of choice.  The only thought given is learning, memorizing, discovering talking points.  I feel that lack of self determination is reflected in how quickly a political party can totally pivot on a belief, and have many of their party members follow along, without ever saying "hey, we *believed* the exact opposite yesterday. What the hell changed?"
[comment]Seems like the CCP strategy to get the Democrats in this November may have backfired.

[comment]Duh, large cities. What are you trying to say, that democrats infect themselves on purpose?
[comment]I’m a democrat and I got coronavirus 3 times! The first time was at the drag show, the second time was with my boyfriend, and the third time was at a meeting with George Soros where we tried to figure out how to get Hillary Clinton to be Joe Biden’s running mate. 

Whenever I come to this subreddit I’m comforted by the fact that none of you will experience the pain and suffering I’ve experienced. Thankfully we have red blooded Americans out there fighting the good fight and keeping America’s economy running smoothly. The second time I got corona virus I would never have admitted this but the third time I realized the error of my ways and subscribed to this subreddit. Hopefully it cures me.

<|startoftext|>[title]First Common Core Graduates Worst-Prepared For College In 15 Years
[selftext]https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/31/first-common-core-high-school-grads-worst-prepared-for-college-in-15-years/[comment]Common core is so asinine.  It tries to teach the kids the tricks at math before they learn the fundamentals.  Without a fundamental foundation, it is impossible to understand how math \*works\*.  Its all about getting the answer right rather than understanding how to get to the answer.  

Follow that up with the reading.  I had to go back and teach my kids how to read because the new method of teaching reading is by forcing them to learn "sight words" which they then piece together into full words, rather than learning to read phonetically.  Both of my sons read at 3 grade levels higher than most of their counterparts.  

Ladies and gentlemen, you're gonna have to teach your kids those fundamentals, because the state run schools are failing your children and you for not doing so.
[comment]They found a way to make liberals even less intelligent, and wastes trillions of dollars to do so.
[comment]Common Core is the reason my mom quit teaching elementary. She was one of, if not THE BEST teacher in her school. Her students had the highest scores and they loved her so much. Her method of teaching was not much different than any of her collegues, but because she was older and had been teaching for many years, the new principal sought to get ride of her. She did everything she could to get my mom fired, but she instead quit after an unfair evaluation.

tldr; CC ruins lives.
[comment]My wife is a master's educated teacher and while common core isn't great there is a lot more at okay than just common core. 

Ie no child left behind, poor parenting, and depending on the state poor education support. NC for example has terrible support and teacher pay has declined significantly since the early 90s.

My point: common core may not be great but this article doesn't make connections with the full picture and is far from the only factor at play.
[comment]I mean, I know we're supposed to hate everything the other side does, but shit I'm disappointed this didn't work.  I've raised my kid not being able to help with math, unable to understand whether they are performing well or poorly, and therefore unable to give proper encouragement.  I had hoped that the professionals actually knew what they were doing but it appears that they don't.  It appears that they are just trying something, instead of doing something that they know will work because they tested it on small sample groups from each state and it performed amazingly.
[comment]It’s almost like letting everyone be winners is making people suck
[comment]My class (class of 2018) was the "test class" of my county. We were the ones they tested all the new tests with, all the new classes with, and all of that stuff. Due to the constant change I grew a strong here for school and started slacking. My family has always been hard on money and now I'm stuck paying for college out of pocket. But I'll be damned if I take out a single loan. Fuck common core, I partly blame it for my hate of modern school, and partly blame it for my early failures.
[comment]I wouldn’t say I’m affected by this since I’m almost done with high school, but this is kind of sad. I hope this doesn’t continue to the point some day I would have to teach my kids, instead of these methods that are clearly failing.
[comment]One of my current high school math teachers is trying these common core ideas of showing us things, but not having us understand it. It’s impossible and nobody knows what’s going on
[comment]JOHN TAYLOR GATTO 

Look him up people. He did all the research so you dont have to. Get government the hell out of education.
[comment]I wonder how these students from 15 years ago are doing.
[comment]As a Class of 19 member

Common Core blows
[comment]As a teacher, I know CC is bullshit but why is this a Republican issue?

Because it superceded NCLB, which also was bullshit? Or because it took hold during Obama? 

Early in my teaching career my Republican governor came to my school when we adopted it and spoke of how important CC was. 

I agree its foolish but theres no "liberal v conservative" notion in pedagogy. I teach. Kids learn. It doesnt really matter what party is in power or what initiatives they endorse.
[comment]Unpopular opinion here.  Common core and standardized testing are good for accountability. 

I don’t get why Republicans hate it. 

I get why liberals hate it. They don’t want teachers to be held accountable for actually teaching accurate things.
[comment]When I showed my kids how I was taught to do math, they all but claimed it was black magic. There's no way math could be that easy.

Thing is, it is that easy if you are taught properly. Fundamentals and what I call math behavior are critical to mastering mathematics.

One of the things they were having trouble with was division. They were only taught box division and that long division can only do up to two digits. Beyond that, you have to use a calculator.

o.0

I corrected them of that notion right away and my wife complained to the school about the math instruction. They had zero issues picking up algebra when listening to me. My 3rd child loved my college algebra notes. She called the cheat codes to the universe. The math was simple and broken down step by step for everything, including the quadratic equation and logarithms.

&amp;#x200B;

It does not surprise me that Common Core has failed students. Honestly, I think it was meant to fail them. If you cannot understand the language of numbers, then you can be more easily fooled and fleeced. Same goes for taking away cursive handwriting... especially since all of our original copies of historical documents are written in cursive.

[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/us/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-on-george-floyd-violence[comment]Good! The man is fucked up and shames actually good police officers everywhere
[comment]I definitely agree the police officer should be charged. However, the violent riots need to end. It’s so disgusting. I also think we need to end the “f@#k 12” or “the police are a gang” bull because we all know the police are so great. The media only leaks the negative. It’s so not fair to people who risk their lives daily to protect citizens of such an amazing country that sit and disrespect them like that. Yes, there are disgusting people who take advantage of such meaningful jobs like that(reference to Floyd’s murderer, he’s a disgrace) and it’s so sad to watch people’s sense of humanity fade like that. But I believe overall the police, emergency response teams, and our government are so strong and amazing and we need to support them.
[comment]The riots don’t help. But let’s not act like people don’t riot and loot and vandal over meaningless things like winning a sports championship.
[comment]He may get charges but probably not convicted. 

1. A conviction will deter cops from doing their job and trying to arrest people due to the fear of going to prison. 

2. A jail sentence is a death sentence for practically any cop. Criminals do not like cops and judges know this. 

3. A conviction would essentially validate the rioters actions and cause more of them in the future. 

None of the cops that the animals have rioted over in the past few years have gotten convicted and I don’t believe this will be a first.
[comment]I read that the preliminary autopsy showed he didn’t die of strangulation or asphyxiation but actually from a heart attack and he had underlying heart issues. Not defending the cop at all, but I think it might be not as simple as I assumed playing out in court.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm about to get sick

From watchin' my TV

Been checkin' out the news

Until my eyeballs fail to see

I mean to say that every day

Is just another rotten mess

And when it's gonna change, my friends

Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot...

I seen the cops out on the street

Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff

And chokin' in the heat

Listened to reports

About the whisky passin' 'round

Seen the smoke &amp; fire

And the market burnin' down

Watched while everybody

On his street would take a turn

To stomp and smash and bash and crash

And slash and bust and burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Well you can cool it,

You can heat it...

'Cause, baby, I don't need it...

Take your TV tube and eat it

'N all that phony stuff on sports

'N all the unconfirmed reports

You know I watched that rotten box

Until my head began to hurt

From checkin' out the way

The newsmen say they get the dirt

Before the guys on channel so-and-so

And further they assert

That any show they'll interrupt

To bring you news if it comes up

They say that if the place blows up

They'll be the first to tell

Because the boys they got downtown

Are workin' hard and doin' swell,

And if anybody gets the news

Before it hits the street,

They say that no one blabs it faster

Their coverage can't be beat

And if another woman driver

Gets machine-gunned from her seat

They'll send some joker with a brownie

And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'

Hopin' for the best

Even think I'll go to prayin'

Every time I hear 'em sayin'

That there's no way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

No way to delay

That trouble comin' every day

Hey you know something people

I'm not black

But there's a whole lots a times

I wish I could say I'm not white

Well, I seen the fires burnin'

And the local people turnin'

On the merchants and the shops

Who used to sell their brooms and mops

And every other household item

Watched the mob just turn and bite 'em

And they say it served 'em right

Because a few of them are white,

And it's the same across the nation

Black &amp; white discrimination

They're yellin' "; You can't understand me!";

And all the other crap they hand me

In the papers and TV

'N all that mass stupidity

That seems to grow more every day

Each time you hear some nitwit say

He wants to go and do you in

Because the color of your skin

Just don't appeal to him

(No matter if it's black or white)

Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we gotta sit around at home

And watch this thing begin

But I bet there won't be many left

To see it really end

'Cause the fire in the street

Ain't like the fire in my heart

And in the eyes of all these people

Don't you know that this could start

On any street in any town

In any state if any clown

Decides that now's the time to fight

For some ideal he thinks is right

And if a million more agree

There ain't no great society

As it applies to you and me

Our country isn't free

And the law refuses to see

If all that you can ever be

Is just a lousy janitor

Unless your uncle owns a store

You know that five in every four

Just one amount and nothin' more

Don't watch the rats go across the floor

And make up songs about being poor

Blow you harmonica son!

I wonder about what is going to happen to either their or their families bank account a month from now?  This is a crazy conspiracy theory but: what if the whole thing was a setup?  He took something just before the cop got there that would kill him. The cop was supposed to make it look like he was being crushed to death and make sure the whole thing was filmed for the world to see. The riots were pre-organized and talking points and allies already set in advance.  Yes I know this sounds crazy but what if?

[comment]I think more moderates are going to join the Trump side. The house of cards is finally starting to fall. Look at what happened in Iowa. It's ideology and incompetence.
[comment]Remember, the most important, critical thing we can do is get out and vote.  While this type of thing may feel good, ultimately -we- need to make the decision about voting - letting it slide because someone else is voting on the deal isn't enough.  GET OUT AND VOTE.
[comment]Have to go vote. Sick of these Democrats and their SJW bullshit. Lets end it!
[comment]If they nominate Sanders, moderates will stay home. If they rob Sanders of the nomination, the woke mob will stay home or vote Green Party. Either way, the Democrats are divided. 

The day after 2020 might give new life to Calexit.
[comment]I'm a lifelong Democrat. I come here because it's the only place where you can have a somewhat civil political conversation. For the last year I feel like I've been watching a slow motion car wreck, and the car just keeps rolling over and it won't stop. The primaries are starting, we're nine months out from the election, and these assholes are still holding hands, skipping down the street and telling us how bad Donald Trump is. I'm starting to wonder if any of them actually want to win. The last time I checked, the debates were for letting voters know what your platform was, and also for telling everyone else why and how bad the other candidate's platforms were. I wish someone would grow some balls. Biden is the only one that has shown his claws, but that's been directed at voters and the press. I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.
[comment]Completely agree.  And they’re gonna be worse this time around.
[comment]"It's the economy stupid!"

Only 3 incumbent Presidents in the last 100 years (Hoover, Carter, and HW Bush) have lost reelection and all of them suffered from not just bad economies, but an economic crisis. Unless the economy tanks, Trump is very likely to be re-elected. 
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/incumbent-advantage-why-trump-is-likely-to-win-in-spite-of-bad-polls

I've argued that it's possible for a "superstar" candidate that really energizes the electorate, like JFK or Obama, to overcome this. I don't see anyone like that in the current Democratic field.

Based on everything we've seen it looks like Trump is going to win by a significantly larger margin than he did in 2016.
[comment]I absolutely can’t wait for trump to win again. If you though the meltdowns were bad last time, just wait until this time. I’m so here for it.
[comment]I live in Silicon Valley, so will certainly vote but it won’t mean anything. That said, I’m confident in the outcome and look forwards to the looks of despair I see the next day at work and Whole Foods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Report says American companies are leaving China en masse — and the coronavirus is speeding up that change
[selftext]https://www.theblaze.com/news/report-says-american-companies-are-leaving-china-en-masse--and-the-coronavirus-is-speeding-up-that-change[comment]best news ever
[comment]This is the right course of action. China needs to look up at the end of this with their economy gutted in the long term. Manufacturing of essential products must be domestic. Industries needing a cheap labor force should move to Vietnam. It’s time to put the global clamps on China and watch the air finally come out of the ballon.
[comment]Yes. China has been growing and expanding by stealing from us. It’s time to make them play fair and make them pay for hiding the truth using the WHO to kill 15k American so far!
[comment]It’s as if the Democrats kept us distracted long enough with impeachment to let their China Option take hold, ensuring a catastrophe requiring exactly the mail-in voting they’ll need to manufacture a win in November.  

Want to guess who’s pulling the strings holding up Biden long enough to install a Politburo executive cabinet, which will promote that to-be-drafted female vice-president spurned for the top job 4 years ago straight into the Oval Office?

It’s the kind of palace intrigue that Mao and Stalin would find exciting. 

Look away from Pelosi digging in her high heels and Schumer bawling his eyes out over the “workers” getting screwed over: that just keeps you from peering behind the curtain. 

They’ve managed to jail us all at home while they plan their mail-in takeover revolution. 

Now, if this all sounds far-fetched, think back about all of the most improbable things in political history that you can think of and respect the fact that they actually happened. 

Yes, Mr. President, they actually do want to push national mail-in voting. 

Resist it with all your might!
[comment]I look forward to the return of manufacturing back here in the US. Hopefully that sort of change can happen
[comment]There is nothing China provides that we cannot get elsewhere, cheaper and without the blatant theft of our IP!
[comment]If this is true then ITS ABOUT TIME! With the threat if China stopping the import of medicines to the US.
[comment]FUCK CHINA (the government, not the people)
[comment]This is good for everyone.  I quickly perused the report and didn't see how much was actually returning to the US.  What I saw was that most of the exodus from China was just going to other Low Cost Countries (LCC), particularly Vietnam.

I do expect that some industries, like pharma, will diversify and even bring some of it back to the States.  But mostly it's going to go to other poorer countries that are a little more friendly / have less of a global stage presence than China.
[comment]Business is built on trust, we cannot trust China, therefore business starts to leave China. Good. We shouldn’t be supporting a dictatorship with business. Time to bring back manufacturing to America.
[comment]Awesome news. We need to get everything out of slave labor China
[comment]So article fails to list the companies? Fake news or did I miss something? Seems like that should be the center of an article like this, no?
[comment]Good.
[comment]where are they going back to US?
[comment]Great news, can’t wait for GM and Tesla to pull out. They’re addicted to cheap labour.
[comment]It’s crazy to me how some people would see this type of news or any news bringing out the truthful facts about the Chinese Communist Government and call it racist. It’s baffling to me
[comment]It's far past the time for American companies to build in America.

Yes I know it will cost them some % of profit.

But God dammit AMERICA FIRST!
[comment]U.S. and its allies should boycott all Chinese goods, withdraw all companies from China, make them pay for all the damages they have caused in the current crisis, recognize Taiwan as the only legitimate 'China', and support separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. These are my five points to hold China accountable for causing this pandemic. Any other points would be appreciated.<|endoftext|>

[comment]The entire world needs to hold their communist government responsible for the creation and spread of the Wuhan Virus.


Oh, and the thousands of people they killed in Tiananmen Square.
[comment]It’s amazing how the left is suddenly defending China because to blame them for all of this means blame gets lifted from Trump.
[comment]Apparently, China is shutting down all its movie theaters after just reopening them. Also, new estimates are coming out that Wuhan might have experienced 42,000 deaths (Rfa.org). Either China is telling the truth and the rest of the world is crazy, or China is lying and the rest of the world is starting to call them on it.
[comment]&gt; ... the prime minister could abandon his previous decision to let Chinese telecomms company Huawei develop the UK's 5g network.

Ho Lee Fuk, the UK is going to have China build their 5G Network?  What the hell are they thinking allowing that to happen?  Let the Communist Party build your cell phone network, real dumb move.
[comment]No way! China lies? Who could have seen that coming
[comment]40X is an interesting number for Boris to throw out there. My wife's former classmates from med school in China and are still based there, some in Wuhan, have told her that they think the is at least 30X, so pretty similar. Of course, they have stopped testing for it now in Wuhan, so who knows what the real numbers are.
[comment]It probably does , based on other evidence. But then people who try to report on it are either literally or legally gagged by China.
[comment]It may even be worse!
[comment]It’s hard to tell what anything is true. The media’s credibility was in very rough shape before this happened. I am starting to morph into the idea that instead of hoping I don’t get the virus. I am more hoping that I can survive and become immune to the virus. Time will expose truths
[comment]Waiting fo the Boris is racist stories from Wapo
[comment]and yet somehow Trump is getting 90% of the blame for this.
[comment]The world should at the very least hold the Chinese government accountable for allowing a market place of exotic/household animals. This is 2020, we should be past the point of eating Bats, dogs, and Cats.
[comment]BorisJohnson pulled an Italy and continued to shake hands despite warnings and now has it
[comment]China is totally lying. This isn’t a conspiracy theory, their only new cases a week after kicking out journalists were “all from travelers.”

They’ve made the decision not to care about their over 70/unhealthy (the vulnerable).
[comment]Of course. It’s the CCP. They cover things up all the time. Tiananmen square?
[comment]I think it's safe to assume China's authoritarian regime is underreporting the numbers. That seems obvious.
[comment]Impossible, China is honest and upstanding 100%.
[comment]This whole source and story smells like BS

[comment]The Trump supporters were fortunate that the attempted assassination happened in Florida rather than Portland Oregon. Had this attack occurred in Portland the police would have arrested the Trump supporters while taking the Nazi day/Bernie Bro attacker to the hospital to ensure his well being. Afterwards the City would ask why the KKK showed up.

[comment]I think you've missed what Bernie has been proposing. The better comparison would be if all the candy manufactured was hoarded by 1% of the population.  Then this 1% is under some sort of delusion that anyone that doesn't have as much candy as them is because they are lazy. Then you put on a Bernie mask ensure that this 1% isn't allowed to hoard everything to themselves and provide access to an education that would help make sure they can get jobs then earn their own candy all while making sure they will get quality healthcare without risk of bankruptcy. But he gives away nothing but opportunity for people to make a quality life.

[comment]He’s a pervert with a past of sexual abuse.
[comment]To me, he’s showing signs of dementia.
[comment]And he is still trying to be president. Bloody selfish if you ask me, doesn’t care what disruption it’d cause to the country, just cares about his coming to power.
[comment]Really? Can't believe it.
[comment]He claimed a while ago that he has the intention of naming a woman VP. I wouldn't be surprised if he appointed Crooked Hillary, claimed afterwards that he has dementia and has to retire and tada: madam President. Oh well, I guess he has to beat Trump for that. GL Sleepy Joe
[comment]I'd like to see us get closer to the election and have him clinch the primary before this all comes out.
[comment]The dude has enough bloopers and informational fumbles to fill a 2 hour YouTube video. Trump is going to crush him in the general election. 

But from a human to human standpoint, I pity anyone who has to suffer through dementia.
[comment]Some, not all, men in politics who want to be seen as true believers and supporters of women when it comes to sexual assault, like Biden, actually believe everyone falls for that. "You're nothing to me." He actually said that to this young lady in this incident. "You're nothing. Nothing to me."  That can be interpreted as both "I will deny this and ruin you if you ever talk because I'm Joe Biden," and also letting her know "I am so powerful, you are simply a gopher bringing me my gym bag and nothing more." The nastiness present. It rings true. Demeaning and trying to see if he can get away with it. My take on Obama keeping quiet for so long about Biden's presidential run without endorsing him: Perhaps Obama knows about things like this that could have taken place while Biden was VP, and perhaps Sleepy Innocent Joe went too far at times around Obama's daughters. We've all seen repeatedly how Biden is around young girls publicly. He probably thought the Obama daughters were "like family." One or both of them probably told daddy and mommy what a creep Biden is, and they do not want to be around him. But it's politics and these men are oh so important icons. So just let it happen as opposed to preventing it by talking about it with him. Why not flat out ask this creep in an interview and let it play out live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]The Left's Strategy for November Is to Accuse President Trump of Killing Americans to Stay in Power

[comment]They will eat it up
[comment]why because the idiots who can’t act responsibly and socially distance get a fuck ton of cases?
[comment]I wonder if the Wuhan virus has caught up to the DNC in murders, just counting the number of people they've Epstein'd in the last few years
[comment]Didn't they literally just run a candidate last time who did that?
[comment]This is literally the only card they have. Too bad his briefings have his ratings soaring higher than ever. I hope this blows up in their face, just like all of their other botched attempts.
[comment]*Looks at the Clinton administration and the people that "committed suicide" because they knew too much* Hmm, where have I've seen this before...
[comment]If Trump’s new ad on Biden is any indication, and the polls are true that his approval rating is rising in the Republican Party and across America, well, let’s just say I have my popcorn ready!
[comment]The Dems will win this easy. Trump is a draft dodging, make up wearing, not paying contractors, ripping off students, ripping off charities, piece of shit, who is touting a drug he has stake in that doesn’t work for Covid 19 so now people can’t get their lupus medication.
[comment]It’s quite literally all they have left.
[comment]We are all that guy in the back
[comment]Yeah because Democrat cities, with their high crime rate, disgusting conditions and rampant homelessness didn’t make shit worse for people, it was all Trump
[comment]Obama/Biden depleted the national stockpile of PPE during H1N1 and never replenished it.
[comment]Trump does have a problem. He needs to open the economy. But when he does the infection rate will spike. So he will be accused of “killing people”. 

The good news is the estimates were for 2 mil. Anything less is a win.
[comment]Ah don’t worry Joe Biden will get confused by the plan and have a mini stroke.
[comment]It’s actually a terrifying indication of the intellectual and emotional immaturity of the U.S.’s voters. Do that many people really believe that Trump has, is or would continue to intentionally kill Americans to win an election? The paucity of common sense and critical thinking is truly stunning. And the dissemination of out-right lies pisses me off. Half of the liars know they are lying (US media, politicians, celebrities and activists) and the other half are too stupid and easily manipulated to question obvious lies, but repeat them anyway. Times like these reinforce my belief that there should be an IQ /CT test to vote.
[comment]That strategy won't resonate.  I hope they try using it.

The more effective approach will be to accuse him of unnecessarily torpedoing the economy.  Eventually we'll see this thing was far less deadly than thought (early numbers like two million dead absent lock downs will be shown to be complete insanity by serological testing).

The media will completely forget their role in stirring up the panic and compelling politicians to act without good data.  All the economic hardship will be placed at Trump's feet.

Note: I don't think that will work either.  I suspect that, despite many missteps in the response, Trump will benefit from all of this.  The stock market was do for a correction and the virus fallout simply lets that play out without being attributed to the administration directly.
[comment]People have a short memory.    
   
It is desperate and dangerous of the dems to try to tie coronavirus to Trump. There will likely be a breakthrough in this battle between now and November. Trump could make it thru this storm on a tide of an expanding economy and a resolution to the virus. It could be like Thatcher welcoming the royal navy back from the Falklands.
   
If there is a happy resolution the dems could be caught once again flat-footed and without a cohesive agenda. The smart move for the dems is to be seen as cooperating with Trump across the board. Open up with kindness like Gandhi or the Dalai Lama. In this way the dems can be perceived as part of the solution and not part of the problem. 

Next the dems need to start converting Trump voters. Take a status quo stance on the second amendment. Allow for a moderate immigration policy. Extend an olive branch to poor white Americans. Allow some ideological diversity into their tent. 

The dems can do these things and still retain their core values. A little compromise and they could convert wide swathes of the Trump voter base. Instead of talking about global warming and taking broad measures to combat that, they should work on fixing and cleaning the environment locally. Red states are full of people that care about their local environment. Persuade these people locally, then you can win federally. 


These are the secrets to defeating Trump. Until there is some kind of re-alignment in the DNC, they won't be able to convert middle-of-the-road Americans.<|endoftext|>

But the Democrats really chilled the shit out of hell.
[comment]I love how everyone is blaming it on everyone else and, of course, as with most things that don't go "their" way, "Why even have the Iowa Caucus anymore"
[comment]Biden not winning the nomination is the best thing that could happen to the Democrats. He's Hillary Clinton 2.0. A manufactured candidate that people don't actually want.
[comment]All I can say over and over and over again is we need to get out in vote November, no matter how much we think Trump has it locked, we need to vote. Need to get others to vote. Not just win the election, but to show the left majority wants Trump and maybe they will shut up and start to work together. Please make sure everyone is voting November.
[comment]Back in 2016, many people said if the Republicans pick Trump, it’s over.  Well we all know how that turned out. Now everyone is saying if the Democrats choose Sanders it’s over.  PLEASE!  Do not let the talking heads lull you into a false sense of security.  We must remain vigilant and insure every freedom loving American gets out to vote on November 3. Anything less and it could spell trouble for our great nation. 

That being said, I truly believe the Democrats are screwed regardless of who they choose.  Wall Street let it be known that if it’s Sanders or Warren, the $ spigot for all races gets turned off.  Without money, they are screwed, that is why they are doing everything they can to stop Sanders’ momentum,  be it changing the debate rules or mucking up the Iowa caucus. Hillary’s direct attack on Sanders is also another shot at slowing him down. Sanders’ 25 million dollar haul is another reason the DNC is so set against him. If Sanders does not need them for funds, what influence can they have over him?  NONE!  

If they don’t nominate him, the Bernie Bro’s have made it quite clear they will not sit back like 2016. A repeat of the 1968 convention is very likely. Many who will not riot, will simply stay home on election night.  So they would have no shot UNLESS we don’t show up at the polls November 3rd. 

The Democrats’ dilema started back in 2016. With her royal highness all set to be crowned queen, the donkeys looked across the aisle and saw a 17 candidate field. Their thought process was how do we season Hillary and give her exposure but keep her protected at the same time?  Answer, let’s let the kooky old guy run against her. It will give her a chance to sharpen her speeches and debates and will only turn out being a speed bump on her way to 1600 Penn. Avenue. Besides, with HRC in the White House, we will not have to deal with Bernie again until 2024 so why not let a NON-Democrat run in the DEMOCRAT primary.  When the old bird caught fire, it scared the living shit out of the DNC and the establishment.  They quickly set about rigging the nomination and making sure he would not win.  The fly in the ointments was Trump!  His victory screwed up all their carefully laid plans.  In 2020, there was no excuse they could come up with to keep Sanders from running as a Democrat party candidate.  Mark my words regardless of what happens, they will approve a new rule that only registered Democrats can run on the party’s ticket after this cycle is over. So now in a panic they are doing whatever it takes to insure Sanders does not win the nomination.  

If you have not done so already, stock up on high quality popcorn and get ready. From now until their convention in Milwaukee, there will be more betrayals and double crosses than any afternoon sopa opera or mystery novel ever written.

[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/us/philip-haney-dhs-whistleblower-during-obama-era-found-dead-police-say[comment]More like he was murdered to make it look like an suicide.

In June 2016, Haney testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he alleged that the Obama-era DHS had ordered him to delete hundreds of files about reputed associates of Islamic terrorist groups. Haney made the case that several attacks in the U.S. could have been prevented if some of the files had not been deleted, the Examiner reported.
[comment]Literally every comment I’ve read so far accepts, without question, that this man was murdered by the DNC. Yet, the article doesn’t mention any evidence of foul play. 

Don’t jump to unwarranted conclusions just because they feel good.

[comment]Turley sure did get a lot of time to speak
[comment]It's annoying how liberal Trump haters love trolling in here. Typical fashion trying to ruin good things
[comment]Thank you stormtrooper 10101002
[comment]He's alleging that only on the case of impeaching for obstruction, which they are not doing solely. The most prevalent article is likely to be based around abuse of power and extortion. 

It's also a circular argument because they aren't able to continue the investigation.. due to the obstruction. It would be the White Houses prerogative to tie it up for as long as possible, delaying it through the election. But it's all a moot point when there is ample evidence to create articles of impeachment on matters other than obstruction of the investigation itself. 

That said, this level of stonewalling is unprecedented in the context of blocking the congressional branch from performing the duty of oversight.

And out of curiosity, if you guys think Trump is in fact innocent in all of this, why block documents? Why not testify, or allow Bolton, Pompeo, etc. to testify? 

"Because it's not a fair court, etc." Well, it's actually being run according to rules that Republicans put in place, so it is fair but even if it wasn't, what would it matter? Wouldn't it still be easier to put forth your exculpatory evidence and testimony if you are, in fact, innocent?

[comment]Honestly. These cartoons are not very good. The punchline is always so obvious. This is not how you make a joke.
[comment]Is there evidence of voter fraud sufficient to warrant our concerns?

It's like [1000 cases](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud) nationwide per year. From a more libertarian mindset, I find it difficult to justify very scrupulous and heavy handed voter qualifications when we aren't seeing or catching people committing fraud in large quantities already. Or is the supposition that it's prevalent but not being recorded? 

I understand election security concerns. I get why you might want to make it more difficult for people who don't agree with you to vote (even though that's unethical). But I've yet to see the data to back the position that people are fraudulently voting en masse or in significant quantities to warrant making the voting process equally or more cumbersome
[comment]The issue is that some states cannot pull it off. Some states do it every year, some states are ready (Ohio) and some states barely allow it (New York) while others could never do it based on available infrastructure (West Virginia).
[comment]This is a non-issue and everyone knows it. Voter fraud or harvesting is so scarce that it couldn’t possibly significantly affect an election. This has been tested and proven. In addition to mail in voting being pretty secure and the infrastructure for it already exists. I really don’t know why the GOP is so concerned about mail in voting. What is the real reason the GOP doesn’t want this going full scale?
[comment]Had a coworker that would vote for her mother, who was an invalid.  I politely replied that was voter fraud.  I dont care was her response, I know what my mother would want.  Mail voting is easily the worst when it comes to fraud.
[comment]Yeah, cause Democrats voting = stolen election.
[comment]Doesn't the military vote by mail? I do almost every year(using an absentee ballot). I prefer sitting down at my computer and researching as I vote. How exactly is this standard practice suddenly bad?
[comment]Not a Republican anymore and it’s this shit right here why I’m not. You will get people killed if you send them to the polls en masse to vote in November and every republican up there damn well knows it
[comment]Fraud is definitely possible with mail-in ballots, but states that already do mail-in ballots don't seem to have wide-scale issues with fraud. I'm more concerned with hacking the ballot machines and rigging an election than I am with a small number of people committing election fraud.<|endoftext|>

[comment]I don't really care all that much about the others.  The first one actually presented corroborating evidence and claims there is material evidence in her personnel file at Biden's office.  That's the claim that deserves all the attention.  At this point in our  nation's history, it's sad to say that no one will ever run for higher office again without people coming out of the woodwork to accuse them of something.  Follow evidence, not unfounded accusations.  Get those personnel files.  Get that police report out there.  If her claims are supported by the evidence, but Biden's ass in the hot seat as well as the media who made excuses for him.  But if none of these other women have anything material to support their claims, too bad.  It's too late for me to care about that.
[comment]Don’t believe any of this.  Probably same old tricks coming from a Hillary again.  I am happy it’s happening to a dem though so they can get a taste of their own medicine and we can enjoy watching their mental gymnastics as they explain why “this is different.”
[comment]I don't get what all the fuss is about. BELIEVE Tara Reade? Not necessary; Biden has been stupid enough to grope little girls and touch their breasts in front of the camera. What more evidence do you need than something you can see with YOUR OWN EYES?
[comment]**SS / TLDR:**

___

7 more of the alleged 25 Biden accusers are named in this article, along with a brief note of each incident. 

Seems like the [MSM](https://twitter.com/MZHemingway/status/1205544519548252160?s=20)/[#LameStreamMedia](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249506799532867585?s=20) are trying very hard to bury every story that surfaces about Biden's inappropriate sexual behaviour with women and children. The pedo-sympathizing liberal leftists will even take it a step further to have reporters removed and silenced for speaking on the matter. **Does the truth hurt that much?**

[comment]thoughts?
[comment]Why do they look so wide?
[comment]One of those guys looks all right.  He looks all left too.
[comment]Here's the full text:

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  
	- v. -  
LEV PARNAS,  
IGOR FRUMAN,  
DAVID CORREIA, and  
ANDREY KUKUSHKIN,  

Defendants.  

—————————————————

The Grand Jury charges:

INTRODUCTION

1\. Through its election laws, Congress prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations and certain expenditures in connection with federal, State, and local elections, and prohibits anyone from making contributions in the name of another. Congress further requires public reporting through the Federal Election Commission (the “FEC”) of the sources and the amounts of contributions and expenditures made in connection with federal elections. A purpose of these laws, taken together, is to protect the United States electoral system from illegal foreign financial influence, and to further inform all candidates, their campaign committees, federal regulators, and the public of (i) the true sources of contributions to candidates for federal office, and (ii) any effort by foreign nationals to influence federal, State, or local elections with foreign money.

2\. LEV PARNAS, IGOR FRUMAN, DAVID CORREIA, and ANDREY KUKUSHKIN, the defendants, conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates’ governments. The defendants concealed the scheme from the candidates, campaigns, federal regulators, and the public by entering into secret agreements, laundering foreign money through bank accounts in the names of limited liability corporations, and through the use of straw donors (also known as “conduits” or “straw contributors”) who purported to make legal campaign contributions in their own names rather in the name of the true source of the funds.

3\. LEV PARNAS and IGOR FRUMAN, the defendants, made additional contributions to federal candidates, joint fundraising committees, and independent expenditure committees that either (i) were intentionally funneled through, and made in the name of, a limited liability corporation to conceal that PARNAS and FRUMAN were the true source of contributions and skirt the federal reporting requirements; or (ii) were reported in PARNA’s name but were funded by FRUMAN, which allowed FRUMAN to exceed limits on contributions to candidates or committees to whom he had previously contributed. The defendants further concealed this aspect of the conspiracy by, among other things, making and causing others to make false statements to the FEC.
[comment]In short, Foreign National-1 (a foreign national Russian citizen) funneled money through the defendants and their LLC in order to contribute to Congressman-1, in hopes to get them elected so they would change the rules regarding recreational marijuana licensing to allow their business venture to capitalize on legal weed. They broke FEC source and limits laws. 

This doesn't appear to have anything to do with Trump. These charges have nothing to do with donations to Trump's campaign. If the defendants assisted Guiliani's endeavors to investigate Biden, this indictment has nothing to do with it.
[comment]I don't even know why this is news.  They got busted for illegal lobbying to start a weed business?  This does not seem worthy of anyone's attention.
[comment]What the bloody hell. No one vetts sources anymore?

[comment]Freeloaders are gonna freeload.
[comment]AOC lives rent free in the trumpanzes head! Love it!
[comment]Maybe she should have saved some of that bartending tip money.
[comment]I encourage everyone commented here to go back read the article. Seriously, we need clear thinking conservatives otherwise this country will go off the rails.
[comment]That’s really funny considering the Dems will fight for every bill that forces union members to pay dues even though members don’t agree with everything they stand for
[comment]Anyone else think Sanders is using her for protection if the DNC screws him again? What are the chances we see him run as a third party, funded in part by AOC.
[comment]AOC is as far as she is going to go

A pawn for Bernie

[comment]r/politics only allows pro Bernie news hadn’t you heard?
[comment]Why do you browse r/politics everyday? All the posts and headlines are twisted and far from factual. Not to mention the bias.
[comment]You won’t see things like this because it doesn’t support the Lefts agenda or narrative. It’s very sad.
[comment]R/politics should be called r/militantleftwingbernienazis.  How they get to call themselves r/politics is beyond me.  I guess it's just more proof how twisted this platform (reddit!) Has become.
[comment]They all sound so immature on r/politics

They badmouth weight....hair ...looks...etc.

What has that got to do with politics
[comment]Correct me if I’m wrong but aren’t dems suppose to be for prison reform? If that’s the case it just proves you can’t do anything right
[comment]This was covered by CNN, NYT, Fox, etc. Not sure how Kim missed it.
[comment]Every day? Why would you do that to yourself?
[comment]It’s not secret that r/politics is abhorrently liberal.  They often praise their fundamental bias over there.  Left that shithole echo chamber a longggg time ago
[comment]r/politics is literally g-guys t-trump is bad. p-please give me upvotes
[comment]wait, you didn't know Trump has been slinging pardons around? 

OK. So this is a thing he likes to do with pardons which appeals largely to the African-American community. Largely, this is good behavior on Trump's part.

Liberal media doesn't cover it because non-violent criminal offenders being let off the hook by gasp... Trump doesn't play to their rhetoric or overarching message. Conservative media doesn't cover it because criminals of any kind should be hammered out of existence
[comment]Pretty sure it's over 100 people now that kim Kardashian has worked with trump to get out of prison now
[comment]Just went on r/Politics and it’s just the left bashing on the right every chance and way they can get it. It’s really sad. The right is so unrepresented on Reddit, it’s not funny. Probably because we have kids and jobs to attend to.
[comment]Stores....... That's where you shop
[comment]r/politics is a joke
[comment]I don't trust the source.
[comment]r/Politics is a biased joke.
[comment]holy shit, i’ve been leaning a lot more left recently but after a couple day on r/Politics and people completely twisting everything you say to somehow make you a racist, bigot, [insert insulting adjective here] when you’re literally arguing for them is fucking ridiculous. makes it really hard to be left when all you see is “republicans can’t find their ass cracks”. btw that actually one of the top comments on one post.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>[title]Kanye West implies he plans to vote for Donald Trump in 2020
[selftext]https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kanye-west-implies-he-plans-vote-donald-trump-2020-n1185346[comment]The Wokeness Level on Kanye West just broke the Internet!

&gt; "I was told my career would end if I wasn't with her," West said, seemingly referencing former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's 2016 slogan. "What kind of campaign is that, anyway? That's like if Obama's campaign was 'I'm with black.'

Yeah, and I think voters might have been more interested in Hillary being with them rather than being with Hillary.

But that's the problem with that whole rhetorical slogan--the sexism of the feminists she's trying to appeal to. If she said, "She's with me!" then it evokes images of weak-willed women following after their male partners.

It was the wrong approach for a lot of reasons.

Kanye speaks the truth here.
[comment]Who the fuck cares?
[comment]I don't see Trump getting more than 5 % of the black vote.
[comment]Like most of the voting public.
[comment]“Implies”
[comment]I’d like to imply that the Biden, DNC, CCPNN, WaPo, MSNPC, Failing NYTimes, and CHINA (the govt not the people) can all GO FUCK THEMSELVES
[comment]Good atleast someone in hollywood isn't retarded,socialist or both

[comment]That's kinda messed up. It's also shocking at how they are saying "should any of that change". Could you post the link to that article?
[comment]Can you sue them if they doxx you
[comment]There’s a great video on YouTube by meme historian called “the CNN skirmishes” that is about this
[comment]And it will never be mentioned again by the left
[comment]He should hope they do. If he doesn't get murdered, he can sue them and get riiich like the covington kid. Bankrupt them!
[comment]I find it interesting that a bunch of adults at CNN went after this person for posting “offensive memes”. They might as well start taking down most of Reddit if that’s how they want to think. Also isn’t one of the biggest unwritten rules of the internet “if you don’t like it, keep scrolling”.
[comment]If you make fun of CNN they will doxx you and put your name and picture and address all over national tv and threaten you to get an apology because you are a threat to free speech...or something....
[comment]I’m outraged
[comment]The kid has a lawsuit. I say lawyer up and sue the shit out of CNN. He’ll make a couple millions out of court settlement
[comment]What was the meme?
[comment]I’ll do you one better https://quality-with-the-quantity.myshopify.com/
[comment]I’m mostly upset the kid didn’t go with “Han AssholeOh”.
[comment]What was the Meme?
[comment]Meme for reference?
[comment]Fascism.
[comment]Fuck CNN and doxxing is for betas....but The “kid” was an adult in his 30s, not some naive 12 year old.
[comment]Who was the writer on the article?
[comment]I haven't watched CNN, gone to their website, or viewed their YouTube videos since this happened. I encourage everyone to do the same.

Remember, you are not CNN's customer. You are their product. They are selling your viewership to advertisers.

Don't be a commodity for CNN to profit off of. They deserve to go bankrupt.
[comment]Makes me sick that this will fall by the wayside.
[comment]Cnn should be shut down
[comment]The Internet Historian did a nice [video](https://youtu.be/b_yCj6fXtlA) about this.
[comment]What was the meme?
[comment]XiNN
[comment]Pretty much threatening to open him up to harassment and the possibility of a nut case coming over. All this over a meme from a kid... You know the people who wrote this message at CNN are real pieces of shit.
[comment]Fun fact, the reporter who threatened to doxx that kid, has his own public wikipedia page.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kaczynski

Since this is clearly public record, I'm not doxing anyone by posting the reporter's name on reddit.

I'm also not saying to harass the guy, but Andrew Kaczynski seems like a sour puss for tracking someone down over a meme.

James O'Keefe also posted a tweet in response.

[comment]What was the meme?
[comment]I forgot all about this, this story easily demands more attention, CNN is horrible.
[comment]I’m all for freedom of speech but come on, we shouldn’t condone hate, bigotry, racism, sexism, government corruption; all those horrible things that stunt us from evolving. It’s a sticky situation; having freedom of speech is such a big deal and I Love it, i don’t want it taken away from me but it’s hard to watch when people start gettin’ all Nazi, if ya know what I mean
[comment]Bet it was a Pepe meme
[comment]Watch Internet Historian. Both sides of the media were trolled hard. Very hard.
[comment]CNN showing how intolerant they really are.
[comment]Not just any meme. THE meme. Gosh that was the greatest tweet I think trump ever posted hahaha
[comment]Yeah. We should focus on doxxing cops that ask mothers to practice social distancing and keep their kids off playgrounds shut due to the virus.
[comment]Yes sticky indeed
[comment]This incident, by the way, is the reason why CNN is domain banned from /r/conservatives.

If the reddit admins followed their own rules, it would be domain banned sitewide.<|endoftext|>

[comment]And just like all the others nothing will ever happen. Republicans are all weak
[comment]How about worrying about Flynn and a corrupt DOJ instead of the former administration
[comment]Oh my god!! 

Seriously can we just all move past the Obama shit? IT DOESN’T MATTER!! Nothing will ever happen to anyone. 

It’s done. 

There are so many more new fires so I don’t know why must we keep fanning the embers of this bygone administration? I’m so sick of seeing this all over the conservative/Republican subs. 

I’m sooooo bored with all the same talking points. I feel like it’s all any of us ever bitch about. 

Obama was President. WAS. Past tense. His administration did what it did. Past tense. 

It’s like a friend or coworker constantly talking about an ex. Sometimes we should just all heed the advice of a Disney song and Let it Go. 

Being a Republican/conservative is just so one dimensional any more.

[comment]Dr. Ferrer has a Bachelor of Arts in Community Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz. She has a Master of Arts in Public Health from Boston University, a Master of Arts in Education from the University of Massachusetts, Boston and a Ph.D. in Social Welfare from Brandeis University.
[comment]Unfortunately many, many politicians take up jobs that are not relevant to their life/school experience. Obviously there is some leeway with different positions where not having that exact experience is more acceptable. 

A very quick search shows she holds a few very applicable degrees to her job.

"She holds a doctorate in social welfare and masters degrees in public health and education."

[https://ktla.com/news/local-news/i-dont-make-decisions-by-myself-l-a-county-health-director-barbara-ferrer-responds-to-criticism-of-her-credentials/](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/i-dont-make-decisions-by-myself-l-a-county-health-director-barbara-ferrer-responds-to-criticism-of-her-credentials/)  

She also has a team of dedicated people to assist with research and decision making. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not advocating for or against her decisions or policies. I do not know her, nor do I live in LA. I really could care less what she does. Just providing some information that seems relevant in knowing she wasn't just plucked off the streets for a job.
[comment]I’m certain she was the best candidate.
[comment]The cryptkeeper
[comment]So an unqualified social worker is in charge of public health in LA County—that does explain a lot. And she certainly isn’t suffering any economic challenges from the lockdown or even encouraging thousands of junkies and crazies to live on the street.
[comment]You wonder why there is a problem.  You are looking at it right there.  Communist activists, a democrat, in public office who's whole goal is to make sure things don't work. No different than a Rob-Public-Wecan.

"Communists never fix the problem they simply fix the blame and manufacture the problem. Because problems for communists are a fundraising opportunity and a political stage."
[comment]She’s a complete loon, nuttier than a fruit cake, moron on a power trip.
[comment]I imagine most county directors of public health aren’t doctors. I know my county’s isn’t. The salary of my county director is around $120K with a population of 170K. I don’t know how that translates to LA county.
[comment]That’s typical California for you.
[comment]And she looks like an extra from Supernatural.
[comment]She's a Dr. of Marxism. In California, being a craven communist is qualification enough for any government office high or low. In fact, people who lack communist creds are prohibited by state law from working in state government.
[comment]I'd say replace her with a cheaper model but her pension is probably more than her annual salary.
[comment]She makes more than the President of the united states. More than The Senate Majority leader and Speaker of the House combined...

Sounds fiscally responsible to me!

[selftext]https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article222424675.html[comment]Amazing, it's almost like treating people with respect and not like victims is kind while saying "I'm sorry, I have more power than and I acknowledge that" isn't.
[comment]Yet minorities still vote overwhelmingly for liberals.  Once again, conservatives get to pat themselves on the back for losing gracefully.

[comment]Well, yeah. We judge people based on their actions and ideas, rather than dividing them by race.
[comment]As a conservative Democrat, I’m tired of the far, far left always talking for the minorities and acting as if they’re the ones who are the victims. 

Not only that, but just in everything.
[comment]Soft bigotry is insidious.
[comment]Every study I see about liberals and conservatives point to liberals having higher rates of neuroses, higher rates of divorce, lower rates of giving charity,  and lower rates of consuming media from multiple outlets. There was one study that said they are smarter on average, and they are obviously more educated. The thing is that smarter people are more prone to believing lies because they can craft narratives to fill in the wholes then the veneer of the low comes off. Smarter people are actually easier to lie to in general, and they maintain that lie in their heads.

Also, they act like being more educated makes you smarter and more informed, yet you go to a college campus and none of them know the bill of rights hardly at all. They are indoctrinated there with all kinds of tripe and they act like they've been freed from the shackles of their public educations, which have a left bent as well. So many are very deluded about reality, like fundamental reality, which is disturbing.
[comment]No shit. Thats because hubris is an extremely common replacement for facts and logic.
[comment]After reading the paper, my concern with the conclusion is whether "competence" focused language vs. "warmth" focused language is actually patronizing. The study found an inverse relationship between competence and warmth usage. In my data science community, we refer to this as a "duh" statistic. If you are using more competence words in the same amount of content, of course you will use fewer warmth words. 

Democrats both use more warmth words and fewer competence words when addressing minority audiences. Do they do this because they think minorities are stupid and are dumbing it down? Or do they do this because they want to express sympathetic emotions towards minorities (who they think have been oppressed in some way or another). 

While the findings of this paper are interesting, it seems uncharitable to conclude that liberals are "patronizing" or worse subconsciously-racist any more than it would be to say that conservatives are colder towards minority audiences than white audiences.
[comment]Minorities are the MOST conservative people I've met. When I point out the similarities in their beliefs &amp; Republican ones, it ultimately comes back to Republican Party not making them feel welcome. They'd rather not vote. Republicans have a white-power image problem - comes across exclusionary.
[comment]I thank god theres a study to back my claim up.
[comment]This isnt news. If you dont already know this then you're lagging.
[comment]This is a textbook example of the soft bigotry of low expectations. It’s the false assumption that you must speak down to, simplify language and assume ignorance when your audience is a minority. It’s an insidious thing because it makes the speaker feel virtuous while patronizing the recipient.
[comment]You people will claw at anything to think that your not racist. Well republicans...you are! You should know that after we throw out Trump, your party is done with forever...and your religion.<|endoftext|>

[comment]She can't, the Indian woman already said sexism is way too strong among the dems
[comment]Tulsi is cool

[comment]Not sure why she stays with the Dems
[comment]She can't be worse than Romney.
[comment]Too bad Ja Rule had to ruin his rep with Fyre Festival.  People turned to him in times of confusion and need.
[comment]This isn't rigging.  This is a candidate with no shot at the nomination, who has not earned her place on stage.
[comment]The fact that Tulsi is not the front runner right now is evidence how much sway the media has over the public.

It must suck to support such a corrupt party or be too stupid to know it.
[comment]Wouldn’t it be great if she came on over and ran as a republican in 2024 and WON?
[comment]They're not worried about her doing shit to Biden or Bernie. They're trying to keep the debate relevant and not have a loser candidate taking up a third of the air time. Not that she would actually get a third of the air time, but you get the idea.
[comment]I actually really like and respect tulsi. She seems to be the only democrat that actually thinks for herself. I don’t agree with a lot of her policies, but I can understand if you do<|endoftext|>

[comment]Oh shut the fuck up, WHO.
[comment]Well heck, that's worrisome, since they lied their asses off to protect China.
[comment]Finally Democrats will hate the WHO like the rest of us
[comment]Concerning... considering WHO said the same thing about China, and we know how China is doing.
[comment]You’ll never see this headline on r/coronavirus that sub is all anti Trump.
[comment]Not exactly a rousing endorsement considering the source, but I guess I'll take it.

[comment]Too little, too late. Get fucked. We need to pull our funding.
[comment]Let's not pretend we like these guys all the sudden.
[comment]I'm shook. The China-backed WHO doesn't shame the US for a change?
[comment]As if the Chinese Health Order’s endorsement has any meaning.
[comment]Probably looking for a handout.

No you don't WHO...we won't get fooled again!
[comment]So... orange man isn’t bad?
[comment]World health organization = Chinese health organization. WHO -&gt; CHO
[comment]Hmm, hearing a Chinese stooge compliment how the US is handling Wuhan Virus doesn’t make me feel very good.
[comment]Lmao...  The WHO is so irrisponsible.. they suck..  it will be interesting because lefties love these people, probably because they are so close to China.  Their heads are going to explode!!
[comment]Ffs this sub was rightfully condemning WHO 5 minutes ago. You cant turn around and post shit like this just because it fits your narrative. This sub is dishonest af.
[comment]Not gunna see this posted in worldnews politics or any other sub
[comment]You mean, the CHO. Because they're in China's pocket. The CHO proclaimed China had Wuhan COVID-19 under control (LIE) on 1/30. Trump ceased all flights into the US from China on 1/31. CHO is barring Taiwan from joining/observing because of China pressure to not acknowledge Taiwan as an independent nation. CHO has been a political bullhorn for China for a long time. Its abhorrent. Tedros needs to resign for the CHO's role in handling/communicating data and ultimately playing a role in causing a global pandemic and the tragic and unnecessary loss of thousands of lives around the world. CHO is a political organization that will speak positively for anyone that will put money in their pocket.
[comment]I feel like the COVID19 response from the WHO is like Bush’s response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. (As the media portrayed it anyways)
[comment]Idk why we are all calling it WHO. It’s called CHO

We won, you don’t need to post fake news to call Hillary names, albeit some of the jokes did make me chuckle, I’m fearful you guys drink your own piss.

This is not a liberal perception. I will never vote for a lib to raise my taxes and create the social welfare state, but holy hell I don’t want you guys anywhere near political discourse and setting the narrative. You guys are straight up goofy and not in a good friend way.

[comment]This is not “collusion”. This is the President explaining that his actions are constrained by appearances during an election. 

“Collusion” is more like soliciting and accepting assistance from a foreign country in winning an election. 

Granting concessions to an adversary (like releasing their seized assets) in exchange for the things we want (like freezing their nuclear weapons program) is called “diplomacy”.

Nice try, though.

[comment]Best of luck with that. The citizens of California will somehow turn a blind eye to their own government and blame Trump.
[comment]This guy is such a massive piece of shit, it makes me so angry to read this garbage. 

Investigating oil companies because of ‘artificially high’ gas prices. HE’S THE ASSHOLE THAT SINGED THAT GAS TAX INTO LAW. 

Blaming the fire issues in CA on ‘a failure of capitalism’ when it’s absolutely the fault of democratic legislation (save the trees) and poor government management (no controlled burns or forestry clearing). 

This guys ignorance and bravado knows no bounds. He’s very dangerous and I hope we can get rid of him because he’s hell bent on turning this state into a communist shithole
[comment]Yeah it's unfortunate that california is going thru that. But it should be his house burning down or going without power.  Fuck gavin newsom!

[comment]I am amazed that there is no voter revolt.
It seems so clear that clearing brush around transmission lines is the proper course of action.
Controlled burns near populated areas seems like a good idea, too.
Surely there is a Republican advocating this course of action
[comment]For what it's worth, wildfires aren't specific to a governor in California, and are more holdovers from poor forest management than anything else. Traditional forest service management has seen fit to allow for forests to be unhealthy by way of being overcrowded. 

Wildfires are going to happen, regardless of which party is in power, and rolling blackouts would almost certainly be implemented with a Republican in office.
[comment]Californians are pissed at PG&amp;E for cutting power after politicians restricted underbrush cleanup, forced costly renewables onto the company and prevented infrastructure upgrades. Shouldn't be much of a shocker here.

IMO even thinking that a culture is inferior is ok, because you’re not attacking the people, and some cultures really are inferior (like ones where certain groups of people are oppressed, or where beheading is ok).

As far as spending: Take over the house and expand dominance in the senate and it doesn't really matter who the president is.
[comment]I mean, I’ve seen her interviews. She doesn’t want to have huge taxes on middle class people, she wants it to come mostly from the top 1%. It is a high bar, though

You pay yourself in business with stock options so even charging billionaires billions a year would be impossible without them liquidating positions. I bet that one would go to the Supreme Court. 

What I’m getting at is we will pay for it. The middle class will pay for it when they charge their model 3s and now they’re paying taxes on electricity. You will get a meat tax for being a meat consumer. Your taxes will also be at minimum 70%. Inflation will push them closer to 90%. The only people who will benefit are those bureaucrats in Washington and those who don’t work/aren’t in high brackets to begin with. Oh yeah like I mentioned: inflation will pay for it bigly. She’ll be dead by the time that hits the masses though as it takes years for people to let it sink in. They will destroy our economy and buy it piece by piece to grow their bureaucracy.

But this greater good mindset is a Joseph Stalin ideology and we all know how that turned out.
[comment]As with any currently predicted Democrat model. 

1) Attempt to tax the rich who will of course flee to protect their wealth.

2) Drain the wealth of this who didnt flee, offering a short term solution to a long term problem you just made.

3) Make excuses for your ignorance because there's no longer rich people left to tax.

4) Increase taxes on the "next of the rich"

5) Destroy the Middle Class in the process.

6) Reduce the economy to ashes and continue to blame everything but yourself as at fault.

7) Continue to run for office on the idea that everything is a right and should be freely provided by the government now that nobody can afford anything.

8) Be elected for life for having destroyed any economic opportunity, forcing the public to vote for you to survive.

<|startoftext|>[title]To Protect the Future, Hold China Accountable
[selftext]https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-hold-china-accountable/#slide-1[comment]As a nation we need to not just ignore that China apologists on the Left but to shame them and shout them down.
[comment]I know that they have their way of life and a different diet than we do, but China definitely needs to step up their sanitation standards or we will keep seeing virus outbreaks over and over again. 
This is a great time for our country to internalize, lose dependence on China, and begin producing things ourselves!
[comment]Accountable how? I think they should start an FDA and OSHA that has high standards on health and safety. (Not sure what they currently have in place) Other then that I see no reason to take this any further with them.
[comment]Isn’t it funny how the left tries to scare us by connecting Trump to Putin at every chance they get, but will defend China with every last breath they can and call anyone who dare criticize them as “racist” or “xenophobic?”
[comment]When we clear this crisis the whole world must join in rebuking China! No trade. No travel. No imports/exports. Nothing! Completely shutter them!!!!
[comment][petition](http://chng.it/V5JWw4Vg) demanding accountability.
[comment]The issue is that the world is globalized, their cultural practices can (and do) have real effects on our lives and livelihoods. Suppression of free speech and arresting doctors who say this is a dangerous disease and bullying the WHO into saying nothing is not acceptable in a global world. Whatever manufacturing we rely on them for we need to do ourselves, and lessening economic regulations is one way we can incentivize businesses to stay here. They need to be stripped any of power they have in the UN, WHO, etc. We cannot let countries that suppress speech in times of crisis be allowed to have any type of swinging vote in IGOs. They have essentially shut the world down, the economy (which was doing great before, I’m hopeful we will be back and up and running strong again in no time), and cost people their lives. China lied people died. I sincerely hope after this is over President Trump holds China accountable for their actions, so something like this can be prevented from happening ever again.
[comment]The whole world needs to lean on them to completely eliminate 'wet markets' with live animals.
[comment]Sanction the shit out of them. They did this on purpose. Lock them out of the international trading community which they have destroyed. All our economies are already tanked, we might as well rebuild them without China.
[comment]Honestly what kind of an idiot would even eat a bat?
[comment]Ok, it’s their fault. But as the article suggests how are we enforcing anything?
[comment]I say we tell them that the debt we owe them is now cleared due to how much we had to spend on keeping our country safe from the virus that they failed to contain. That's it, we're even, goodbye.
[comment]U.S. and its allies should boycott all Chinese goods, withdraw all companies from China, make them pay for all the damages they have caused in the current crisis, recognize Taiwan as the only legitimate 'China', and support separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. These are my five points to hold China accountable for causing this pandemic. Any other points would be appreciated.<|endoftext|>

I don’t understand how the party of values always seems to have the two wrongs makes one right attitude to justify Trump. If he was doing illegal things in Ukraine prosecute him to the full extend of the law but that goes to Trump too.
[comment]Ignoring congressional subpoenas is fine and well, though, right?
[comment]He said he won't voluntarily testify. If he refuses a Senate order he should be locked up with everyone else who has done the same.
[comment]With America at risk, Biden chooses to be absent.
[comment]I’m still trying to figure out what Obstruction of Congress means
[comment]He's not wrong. He shouldn't testify. This is about Trump's abuse of power. Asking him to testify is only a distraction.


Want to investigate Biden? Go through the proper channels. Don't ask Ukraine or China to do it and don't ask him to testify at your own trial about his own crimes. That's just idiotic.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://nationalinterest.org/feature/great-us-china-divorce-has-arrived-146177[comment]Thank you President Trump for MAGA!
[comment]Written by Bill O'Reilly

China’s Bio weapon, and Pelosi.. My wife Angie will tell you that I study history and world events fluently every day. I have studied China for many years. To get answers I need to questions, I call many I know in Washington on Capitol Hill (from my tenure on two Presidential campaigns and Presidential talks) and I ask them for straight up answers to better understand what affects us as a nation.

Well, in 2016 America elected a new Sheriff: Donald J Trump. For decades the Chinese walked all over America but the new President said “not anymore”. Trump literally strangled China’s economy to the point their economy was in its worst free fall ever. Trump negotiated a new 50 billion trade agreement. He had Xi by the proverbial balls. America’s economy was on fire and unstoppable. President Xi Jingping knew he could not beat the USA militarily and he knew any domesticated economic attack would fail as our economy was too strong. He had to act. But how?

Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren’t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand , the Chinese regime are truly Barbarians. Notice I did not say ALL CHINESE. The Chinese people are a good people. I enjoy my interactions with them.

The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn’t kill everyone, but kills “enough,” especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society.

Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses “models” too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would “level the economic playing field” and not have fired a shot.

Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China’s own doctors attempted to sound the warning, they were immediately silenced. In fact one died and another has simply disappeared. Trump and the other allied leaders indeed KNOW this is what happened. They have under reported their own deaths. Trump knows he cannot outrightly seek retribution. His news conference today showed me this when he balked publicly about no outright retribution over Xi’s handling of this and he immediately brought up the “trade deal”. However, Trump wasn’t being weak, he too was now being coy. We know this was a biological weapon. The food market story is bullshit.

Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything.

I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier. We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this.

But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the “room” and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field.

Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn’t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a “war” President. He is.

But now on not one but two fronts. One front is the virus and the other front is the Chinese. While the Saudi’s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren’t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field.

But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He’s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I’m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again, another reason for Trump putting to sea such a sizable Naval Force. Sending a clear message.

We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday’s statements she made were truly appalling and the lowest of low. I didn’t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation.

But, Pelosi aside, make no mistake, China must and will be taught a lesson the likes they have never seen before and Trump is the man to pull the trigger.

We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party) are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people, Trump indeed tried to warn us all of the Conavirus in his State of the Union Speech. He spoke of it. He said he was on top of it.

After he spoke , Nancy Pelosi ripped up the speech calling Trumps words “a manifesto of lies”. She disgraced the country and all of our fellow honored citizens present in the House Chamber. Well she now has American blood on her hands. She is very majorly responsible for these needless deaths as well as the Chinese. Her and Adam Schiff.

The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well, as they laughed the disease he just spoke of in that speech came to our shores. Republicans and Democrats alike are now dying. Your family members and mine. Our grandparents and middle aged citizens alike. Bodies are being loaded in trucks with forklifts in Brooklyn outside of hospitals. No one is safe. Our liberty is for the most part suspended. As we bury our dead (without proper funerals) from this calamity let’s drive the nails into the coffin of the Democrat party as well in November.

It’s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for God’s blessing on our nation. But, God also gave us the ability to think for ourselves and it’s time we placed blame for all this death where it belongs: on the doorsteps of Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Xi Jingping directly. Wake Up America.  WAKE UP!

[comment]Yea until Trump is out of office and the next Democrat president will fold and say its good for America
[comment]Meh, we will get a democrat in office at some point and they will roll over and make America the worlds bitch again.
[comment]I've been saying it for a while now. Until China wants to start honoring their agreements and fairly trading with the world they have no right to be in the free and open market.
[comment]At least the CCP/PRC has Hollywood, Democrats, and the media (but I repeat myself) on its side.
[comment]Let's stop pretending that we're breaking up with them because of some higher moral standard.

Wages have more than tripled in China over the last decade. It is significantly cheaper to manufacture in India or Southeast Asia. It's actually cheaper to manufacture in parts of Europe than it is in China. 

Companies around the world are leaving China, not because of ethics, but economics.

China is trying to move on from manufacturing and into the tech sector, and compete directly with the United States in the tech sector. They don't want our manufacturing jobs, they want our high paying desk jobs.  

AND THEY'RE GETTING THEM.

[comment]It's sad when politics become more important than truth. The Democratic party has, in my opinion, forfeited the right to lead America. Even if the alligations prove false, they should be addressed.
[comment]Yeah but Democrats could careless as long as they win
[comment]If it weren’t for double standards, Democrats would have none at all.
[comment]They are doing thier best to make sure no one hears about it, therefore they can't be shown as hypocrites
[comment]The Democrats have outdone themselves on this one as their very own national disgrace. Apparently whether or not a woman has been raped is based solely on politics. When a street thug rapes a woman, does anyone in court ask the political party of the victim or the suspect. Not that I've ever heard in 34 years in courtrooms. At what age do we begin to use political affiliation in sexual assault cases; does it depend on whether the victim is registered to vote? Why aren't female journalists at the very least asking questions about this.
[comment]Biden is going to get stabbed in the back by his own party eventually. That’s why they’re letting this fester in the background. This is a sword of Damocles over Biden’s head that is barely hanging on.
[comment]If the Republicans are okay with a candidate with dozens of sexual assault allegations, then Democrats should be okay with a candidate with one. If anything the Dems are some playing by the same rules.
[comment]Ha
[comment]It really is. The fact that they’re not even trying to discredit her and just flat out ignoring it is a contradiction I wouldn’t even expect from the left.
[comment]Liberals just straight up ignore it. I haven’t even seen them try and justify it. They just don’t talk about it and pretend it isn’t real.
[comment]This can't be a surprise? par for the course.
[comment]Just goes to show you the #MeToo movement is a farce. Certainly discredits any woman who actually has been assaulted.
[comment]The real reason we had to lock every woman and prepubescent child in America in their homes and fine anyone not staying 6 ft. apart was to keep them safe from Joe. Biden is the true virus
[comment]Just goes to show you that Democrats consider you to be lower than scum.  You're only here to serve at the pleasure of their masters.  They are sycophants of the worst order.
[comment]You are so right. The whole world is laughing and it shows, especially after the metoo# movement, the desperation among Democratic women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>[title]Time for the US to declare independence from China
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/time-for-the-us-to-declare-independence-from-china[comment]China and Russia
[comment]I feel like we need to deal with the immediate problem. Then, circle back to consequences and discipline.
[comment]Frankly this should have been done years ago. Key industries should be done in the US. Case in point. Computers. We don't let China make our tanks and warships for us. Why do we let China make our computer hardware and software for us. You can't have a secure computer network when are computers are made in China. An industrial spy working for the Chinese government can put a backdoor entrance and bang, their hackers are in.
[comment]There will be serious problems with this transition. Our country would have to reposition thousands, if not millions of jobs, manufacturing plants, offices and distribution locations to even put a dent in what China produces for us. I want to be independent of them as well, but we are REALLLLLY deep.
[comment]I agree but the American people are going to realize certain things will cost more, one option would be to shift tax cuts away from wealthy and move down to the middle classes. But in case we need to move away.
[comment]People are already making their own personal boycotts of chinese goods. It’s already happening
[comment]I would love that. Too bad there's so much money to be made there though. That's way too tempting.
[comment]
Yeah this will never happen this country depends on cheap products from China
[comment]The US: declares independence

The US: *A G A I N*
[comment]r/fucktheccp
[comment]I fully support this, however, can we tone down this "independence" shit. Really annoying.
[comment]Agreed.  It's time to force American companies to produce in other countries.  Tariffs and boycotts.
[comment]The invisible hand of the market moved everything off shore. What's your plan? Nationalize key businesses? Regulate key sectors and force capital to manufacture here?
[comment]Tell that to the CEO’s
[comment]Yeah idk I prefer that the prices of electronics don’t double... but that’s just me.
[comment]Wall Street needs to cooperate. Until the greedy hedge fund managers buy in, it ain’t happening. I don’t think this pandemic will even change things. 2.2 trillion economic package. Gee, I wonder who’s going to buy that dept? Just print money, now that’s the solution. At the end of the day companies go the least expensive route to provide their products or services. It remains to be seen if things will change when this virus is done. Meanwhile we’re entering depression era economy
[comment]The only way this will work is if it were tied to national defense; however, with the international trade deals it could be considered protectionism.   

The only way I can see this actually working would be to set up something similar to the Maritime Subsidy Board with the various makers of articles deemed critical to national defense then these factories would be subsidized to run in the country.   Setting this up could be seriously abused.
[comment]I was hoping all this was going to wake America up and cut the ties with China!
[comment]sanction china
[comment]And the U.S. media will fight us all the way.
[comment]At this point I dont know anymore. China has demonstrated to the world that its far better at tackling crises like this. Almost the entire western world has failed to take this virus seriously. 

Even with all the secrecy and stalling china did at the start its still handled the situation better. Even if their figures arent entirely true (which is probably the case) theyve still done a better job. 

From a purely pragmatic standpoint wed be better off being run by china in this case. Really dissapointing how democracy has fucked this one up.

I dont support china or actually want to live under them, but theyve one this one it seems.
[comment]U.S. and its allies should boycott all Chinese goods, withdraw all companies from China, make them pay for all the damages they have caused in the current crisis, recognize Taiwan as the only legitimate 'China', and support separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. These are my five points to hold China accountable for causing this pandemic. Any other points would be appreciated.<|endoftext|>
