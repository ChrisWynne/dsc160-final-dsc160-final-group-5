<|startoftext|>[title]Charlotte Alter: If Warren drops out, I’m not so sure Bernie can necessarily count on those voters. Many are educated liberals who like Warren because they’re attracted to her *practicality,* alienated from Bernie’s sometimes-aggressive base, and want Trump gone more than they want revolution.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/CharlotteAlter/status/1235246862287777792[comment]&gt;Put another way: despite their ideological similarities, if you're still voting for Warren at this point, it means you have deep reservations about Bernie.

&gt;And the way many high-profile Warren supporters have been treated by the Bernie base doesn't help.

&gt;Anecdotally-- I'm hearing from Warren voters saying they now plan to vote for Biden, and that the mistreatment from the Bernie base is a big part of that calculation. They use words like "rude" and "negative" to describe the vibes coming from Bernie camp.
[comment]Frankly she should just endorse Biden at this point. It would do a lot to help unify the party and clear the lane for Biden, allowing us to focus on the general election.
[comment]Looking at this another way: If 50% of Warren supporters would vote for Sanders, and 50% of them would vote for Biden, but if 90% of Sanders voters would vote for Warren, and 10% would vote for Biden, then it would make more sense for Sanders to drop out...
[comment]This fits me really well.   It is almost my exact reasoning.
[comment]God y’all are so intolerable. If you have your way Trump will be re-elected.
[comment]As a Bernie supporter, it's really disappointing to me to see the aggressiveness and attacks coming from fellow Bernie supporters. I think they feel desperate like I do.

My wife is disabled and I work 54 hours a week so I don't think I'm your average Bernie supporter. I feel like running around and yelling at people but that's not how you win people over. I'm just so frustrated with everything.

I will 100% back whoever the Dem nominee is, I just really wish it's either Warren or Bernie. I'm concerned Biden will be harmful to my family if he inherits Trump's massive deficit.
[comment]We're being held hostage by scared children that want to go back to pretending nothing's more concerning that the next episode of Jersey Shore.
[comment]"*sometimes* aggressive base"

Lol!😄
[comment]It still makes me laugh how disillusioned Bernie supporters are on social media. They assume they're always being cheated and bully the supporters of other candidates but get super upset when you stand up to them. Alter is 100% right, most democrats are not ultra-progressives but BBs only feed off each other on reddit and twitter to build up their illusion of dominance. I like Elizabeth Warren and would fully welcome her and her supporters into the Biden camp when she eventually drops out.
[comment]As a Yang supporter I got *extremely* negative vibes from Bernie Bros. I still voted for Bernie, because recognizing healthcare as a human right is far more important than someone being mean to you online.
[comment]Warren's voters are HER voters.  They are not Bernie's by default.  She is not "stealing" his votes.  She has earned *hers*. 

Isn't that what Bernie supporters have said for the last 4 years? You have to "EARN" my vote?

So Bernie and his sycophants, go earn their votes.  Send them some more death threats.  That works wonders.

If a person is still supporting Warren, despite her zero percent chance of winning the nomination, then they have already done the math and decided they aren't willing to jump ship for Bernie.  Period.  Send some more snake emojis their way.  That has really urged them to come to your guy.
[comment]I don’t worry about Warren voters voting blue in November, but it’s Bernie’s base that I’m concerned about.  

Warren should be getting praise today for single handedly ending Bloomberg’s undemocratic run, but instead she’s being harassed online by the far left. If your base is attacking Warren, how do you expect moderates or independents to coalesce around Bernie in Nov?
[comment]I voted for Warren in our primary. I’m a white college educated liberal who thinks she would make a terrific executive even if she isn’t the best campaigner. 

If I had to choose between Bernie and Biden...I’d probably choose Biden. I agree with Bernie’s values but I’m deeply skeptical about his ability to be an effective executive. 

Biden, I just think he would manage not to fuck things up too badly.  Not a ringing endorsement, but light years better than any Republican. 

I’ll be out knocking doors for the winner either way.
[comment]I condemn a lot of the worst behaviour from Bernie supporters but people need to understand that Bernie represents the some of the most disenfranchised and marginalized people in American society. He polls strongest with young people of every race, including black and latino, latinos in general and the working class. These are people who are burdened with debt, lack of job opportunities, unaffordable health care and no path to home ownership. People who have had their unions fall apart and their jobs move overseas. So yes the base is going to be aggressive and a lot of that aggression is out of frustration, that they're watching their future being taken away from them.
[comment]Bracing for the misogynistic backlash against Warren if she doesn’t fully endorse Sanders in *3, 2, 1......*
[comment]I totally understand the Warren fan sentiment, and I get it from Pete and Amy fans too. When Pete bowed out a Bernie Bro posted a meme that called him an offensive name and gloated about this dude dropping out of the race...even if OP was happy in that instance (and what kind of person gains happiness from another's misery?) how stupid do you have to be to alienate potentially displaced voters.

I have posted over on some Bernie subs (I'm a Bernie supporter: surprise!) that Warren's base doesn't owe us a damn thing, it's our job to inspire new votes to come to the booths, but people keep moaning as if Warren's % is going to immediately translate to Bernie when the reality is it would fracture and the majority of it would probably go to Biden. 

Bernie definitely has some immature people making loud noises and doing obnoxious, sometimes grotesque things on the internet and not enough fellow supporters are stopping it, and if some of the Chapo House claims are true, then Bernie's campaign isn't doing enough to stop it. 

For the record I do not believe that Biden has a snowballs chance in hell in beating Trump, but I also don't necessarily know if Bernie does either. Bernie to me, always seemed like someone who could connect with Trump supporters because I always seemed to see him being the one to garner misplaced Trump supporters (and really MI with their open primary in the rust belt will tell wether that's truly possible). But for all of us worried about Trump (and I am one of those worriers) what is alarming more than anything from ST, is just how much of his base showed up for a Primary he already won.
[comment]Imagine being so clueless that you think how someone delivers their message or deals with others is irrelevant in politics. Then imagine also believing you should  run an entire political party.
[comment]Warren voters will not vote for Sanders according to my Twitter feed.
[comment]Dude what ever. Nah sayers. Have some hope.
[comment]I can't bring myself to support either Biden or Bernie. Or any man. I want Warren. She is best prepared to deal with the dumpster fire Trump will leave us. She has proven her understanding of good government. 
If Trump survives to campaign, I will vote for the Democratic nominee. 
I will not canvass, poll or donate. They have demonstrated no interest in women voters. I'm not carrying another man on my back. Warren shouldn't, either. I'd like to see her her say it: we need a different perspective and a trained mind. 
No more white men. Sorry.
[comment]But Biden would be more likely to keep Trump in power than Bernie...
[comment]They will if she drops out and endorses Bernie
[comment]well i like bernie and warren both .. but if the democratic elite (corporate )

try to screw bernie or warren then i am voting for trump .. to heck with the dems .... they have fought for corps to many times and now biden is trying to get in
[comment]I would suspect most of her supporters would back Bernie if she endorses Bernie and starts campaigning for him because if he wins, that means Warren would play a big factor in crafting things like M4A and eliminating student debt in the Senate.

People need to get tougher skin if a few internet trolls bother them that much.
[comment]Biden is Republican lite. Warren railed against him and his ilk and said she would support most of the same policies as Bernie. I cannot fathom  her or her followers supporting Biden over Bernie.
[comment]Sounds like the corporatist talking point of the day.

If they want Trump gone maybe Bidens gaffes and being on both sides of so many issues is worse
[comment]"It would be great if people didn't die when they have no health insurance, but oh dear those people who also want them not to die are so so rude in insisting on them to live, I'll just have to go elsewhere because my tender sensibilities are so much more important."  


I came across a man lying in the middle of the street one morning and I realized he was having a heart attack. I ran to get help, but while help arrived I went back to put my CPR training to the test. I went to give the  man mouth to mouth, but I was immediately aware that he was a heavy smoker because he began expelling black mucous. It was revolting. So I had to ask myself. Are you going to let your squeamishness sentence this man to death?  Hell no. So despite it being completely disgusting I continued the CPR. I was called by the police that afternoon who thanked me for my efforts but that sadly the man passed a few hours latter in the hospital. If I had not done everything in my power to save him I don't know how I could have lived with myself.   


How do these people sleep knowing the death count for their inaction is in the thousands.
[comment]I'm picking the ideologically opposite candidate because some random people were mean to me on the interwebz.

It's funny, democrats are, or should be, fully aware of the Mueller report and the russian propaganda campaign. But when it comes to "Bernie bros", which was orchestrated and continues to be propagated by Russia, not only does the left wing media completely ignore that fact straight from the Mueller report, but democrats themselves seem to just believe every hostile person on the internet is representative of a single candidate.

It's not like Bernie is calling for the burning of churches here. Its literally infuriating that people can actually blow such dumb nonsense out of proportion.

But it serves us right, Democrats didn't want to listen when it came to HC. We continually have no problem nominating people wrapped in scandal-bows for the GOP to dismantle in the general. We just look the other way when Hillary Clinton goes to a private, wealthy gathering and tells them you should have a public and private persona. We just look the other way when CNN is leaking debate questions to her. We just look the other way when she bit-bleached her hardware after it was requested for review. Meanwhile we're suppose to make the case that if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't hide your taxes, Mr. Trump. Yeah, doesn't sound so good.

And now comes Biden. Any Democrat that thinks this entire Burisma thing looks 100% clean is straight up delusional. The GOP told Trump to quiet down and save that ammo for the general. It's the only reason they stopped with Burisma. The republicans are withholding all their attacks. There's more related to Hunter, with Biden voting for bankruptcy bills that Hunter's credit company wanted passed while he was on the board. Meanwhile they'll also push the block Bernie narrative in an attempt to piss off the liberal wing of the party.

I get it; he's better than Trump. But my god can we stop handing Republican's our nominee on a silver platter with an apple in his mouth? 

If we lose this election I'll be expecting a new party, because I won't be voting democrat for the rest of my life if this party fails again at beating this psychopath, and while you're all going to blame the liberal wing, I'm gonna go ahead and blame the rest of you because you're the ones picking the candidates every election. So for the love of God, if Biden wins nomination, you fuckers better make sure he wins, because there will be a mass exodus in this party. Rant done, sorry. Just really pissed about the politics in this country lately. It's been a long 3 years.
[comment]Sorry to say,  Warren was the Queen of Change Her Mind to What Bernie is Doing that Debate........js
[comment]Biden has no chance to beat trump. If she supports him she cares more about pleasing the establishment than her actual positions on any issue.
[comment]Sorry someone is angry at her. this is serious and everyone knows biden=4 more years of trump. So people should be pissed.  If she supports biden she is not progressive, she is establishment.
[comment]I'm so torn over all this because I want a progressive candidate so badly. Warren, unfortunately, did not poll well, and I know for a fact if the previous primaries had gone differently and demonstrated that Warren was trending toward the top I would have certainly relinquished my support for Sanders and went with Warren. I voted for Bernie because I legitimately thought he had the best shot. I strongly believe in what both candidates campaigned for, I just had stronger feelings toward Sanders. The last-minute coalescence of the democrats definitely shifted things in Biden's favor, the outspoken "squeaky wheels" of Sander's supporters, in addition to the lack of young voters coming out all kind created a formula that worked against Sander's campaign.
[comment]That is a cool way to paint Bernie as an extremist ... very cool and so unfair subtly nasty I think.      
Yes quite nasty.     
She doesn't blame it on Bernie but his base, using the same vocabulary as the one used for the Trump goons.    
And of course the base is placed aside to the educated liberals who naturally like Ms Warren ... sorry but I am a little bit educated and I like Mr Sanders.       

She also gives us the practical key work as opposed to what ?  ... solving issues ? Because this is the focus of Bernie's action.      
So the revolution ending shot rings like the bells of the Churches of Petrograd in 1917. But wait Bernie is absolutely not Lenin ... this is not an Alter net reality here.     
No   
And I don't think that Canada or Europe are that much revolutionary and I am quite impressed by their health care system.
[comment]Two words: Russian trolls. Y’all are falling into the exact same trap as 2016.
[comment]If we are practical and want Trump gone above all else, we will ABSOLUTELY support Bernie. Biden is an incoherent mess of a candidate that's on the wrong side of so many progressive issues it's embarrassing.

He is benefiting so much from people not really paying attention to him because other candidates were more fun to talk about. He won't last in actually watched debates.

He is much less likely to win. This panic at Bernie is insane and self destructive. 

I love Warren. She's made some political mistakes that annoy me, but she was my candidate ... until she became unviable. Now I want to win in November. Now I need Bernie to be the nominee.
[comment]Berniecrat here.

I was immediately totally banned from the Warren subreddit for making a common sense suggestion to not make her campaign entirely about her gender.

I don't care what happens to her if they want that kind of policing.

Biden is a million times better than Trump but he'd rather please white nationalists and insurance companies than produce clean progressive legislation.  I'll be voting for Biden if it cones down to that but only for the Supreme Court because anything he tries to do will be gimped by extreme white nationalist oligarchs.
[comment]Count me as one who has been alienated by Bernie's usually aggressive base. I don't buy the "oh they're just passionate" b.s. anymore.
[comment]That could be true. The only thing we know for sure is that warren is NOT a viable candidate in this race. Voters have spoken; she got THIRD in her home state. It doesn’t matter where her supporters go but she needs to drop. It’s a two person race now.
[comment]Boomers have spoken, corporatists have won again and all they had to do was keep crying about anonymous mean comments and pinning them to Bernie.
[comment]I'm one of these people.  I'm voting for Warren on Tuesday, unless she drops out / endorses Bernie.   

At this point, a vote for Bernie is a vote for the tribal infighting that we are clearly not intelligent enough to be above.   

I started feeling cautious optimism this year as things went on - but this is going to be another election of memes.
[comment]Unfortunately, your holy Biden has already lost.
[comment]I’m hoping for Sanders Warren 2020.
[comment]I don't know why anybody would pick Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren. She's actually accomplished things and is exactly the right age to be President.

I also don't know why people would assume that Warren supporters would be more likely to go with Sanders than Biden. Personally, I think a Joe Biden/Elizabeth Warren ticket would create a blue tsunami. I'd like to see Biden and Warren make that deal asap.
[comment]What a cowardly attitude, #OnlyBernieBeatsTrump2020 putting anyone else up there IS the same as voting for Trump. Joe has Dimentia for ffs. Wake the hell up.
[comment]That’s me. I was a Warren voter, now I will back Biden.
[comment]What a load of Orwellian doublespeak. "That Joe Biden is double plus good"!
[comment]“They want Trump gone more than they want a revolution”. You can literally have both, it’s tiring to see the argument that Bernie would lose to Trump. According to [the most recent polls](https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/) Bernie does *better* than Biden against Trump.

##**There is no neutral on a moving train**

If you do not function against Trump's protofascist movement, you function for it. 

Now is when we separate the compassionate and mindful from the credulous and self-absorbed. 

There is no neutral on the racism train either. You can either function against a white supremacist president, or you function as a racist. 

Are you with us, or are you with them?
[comment]And sadly he is correct...after that all bet a are off defeat Trump first. Than whatever impeach Biden I don't care
[comment]I'll always be a Bernie bro, but right now I'm Ridin' with Biden!
[comment]Bernie knows Donald trump is an existential threat to not only Americans, but the world.
[comment]Bernie is a very sensible and moral man. He was never going to throw in with Trump.
[comment]That’s what I’ve been saying and getting down-voted.
[comment]He’s right. Either you vote Biden or you’re voting for Trump (by voting third party or not voting at all).
[comment]Sanders is right. Every time the Democratic candidate has lost it's because someone on the Left split the vote.
[comment]Fuck yeah it is. Thank you Bern!
[comment]Sellout LOL
[comment]I still oppose Biden and the conservative-center of the party. 

I just oppose the GOP a hell of a lot more.
[comment]Anyone who thinks there's no difference between Trump and Biden, or just don't care and want to vote for Trump out of spite, needs to read Trump's 2021 budget. It's an eye opener.

[comment]didn’t reddit call Yang a sellout for endorsing Biden also?
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to influence Biden’s campaign and allow a vision that works for both voter groups.

And fix the SCOTUS.
[comment]You mean that Trump isn’t honoring his commitments? Shocking!! 😱

[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/bernie-sanders-drops-out-of-2020-democratic-presidential-primary.html[comment]I didn’t even get to vote in a primary before everyone dropped out. This is why we need a national primary day instead of a 6 month spread.
[comment]Finally did the right thing, now he needs to get his supporters to vote blue in the general.
[comment]The writing was on the wall.  For better or worse, Biden is the pick now.  I really wish it was a stronger candidate, but I don't buy the narrative that he can't beat Trump.  Trump is very beatable.  We'll see how it goes...
[comment]I’d vote for my dog if I felt like the pup had a chance of taking the White House.  I’d have voted for Bernie had he been the nominee.  My sympathies to his die-hard supporters but there’s only one choice in the matter now.
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to fight hard to oust Trump and also reform healthcare in some way--perhaps not exactly the way he envisioned but in some capacity.
[comment]Fuck, now we have to vote for Biden. Just once I want to vote for someone I want, not against someone I don't.
[comment]No refunds lol
[comment]We should be totally focused on trump now.
[comment]Biden is about as appealing as a bowl of room temperature mayonnaise.
[comment]So let me get this right, he waited till after voters in Wisconsin risked their lives to stand in line for hours during a pandemic to vote overwhelmingly for Biden? Fuck that guy. He's as bad as the anti-amercan Republicans in that state who sued to block the delay of the primary and the criminals on the court who upheld the lawsuit. Fuck them and fuck him.
[comment]sad
[comment]I'm surprised.  Maybe he thought it was best to come together, with the pandemic going on
[comment]Even if I can't elect Bernie, I'll be there to vote against Trump.
[comment]Ah yes, we all end up with what only a few people marginally wanted.

Not a Bernie supporter at all and I do think Biden is the "best bet." But holy shit this is like saying the Oklahoma is the best bet of the Big 12 to win it all - its true but you'd much rather have a top team from any other Power 5 be your team.

My fear is he doesn't have the fight. He's too enlightened centrist to me. When/if the death toll hits 100k, he needs to be vicious in blaming Trump for each one. But I fear he wont' and instead will say shit like, "he did a good job in some areas" or some idiot thing like that.

Is it too late to draft Cuomo?
[comment]Blue. No. Matter. Who.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I liked Bernie. I voted for him in my states primary. But Biden has been winning the primaries left and right. 

Think of it this way. Who would you rather pick the next Supreme Court Justice: Trump or Biden?
[comment]So, for some Bernie supporters, now is the time to ignore what he says is the best thing and that is to get rid of Trump. 

Sounds like that group wasnt supporting Bernie at all.
[comment]Sanders has left the race and I feel that many of us will miss him for better or worst. Now, we must prepare for the republicans to target disillusioned Sanders supporters to vote green, not vote, or vote Trump. They're planning a massive disenfranchisement media movement against us. We need to use our time and energy to email the  Biden campaign and remind them that this race will be consequential and NOT EASY.
[comment]Alright people, it’s time to rally around Biden whether we like it or not!
[comment]Biden should tap Obama for the VP spot

[comment]That’s because it never happened, you cannot pretend that Hillary chose Kaine as her running mate over a progressive that would have appealed to the progressive camp.
[comment]**TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE POSING AS DEJECTED BERNIE SUPPORTERS AND BAD WINNER BIDEN SUPPORTERS. They are desperate for 2020.**
[comment]My hero in politics is out of the race, and it’s really damaging to see it. But I think he put up a good fight, and I hope he falls behind the Democratic Party ASAP and continues the fight in his remaining time in the senate. Vote blue no matter who!

I can't wait to hear the excuses as to why we need another "moderate" aka do nothing, working class people stay broke candidate, 4 years from now.

Maybe we can run Hunter next. Gotta make sure it's a moderate with a scandal and all, too.

Bring on the downvotes nerds.
[comment]Obviously the attacks on Bidens son are entirely reprehensible and I hope whoever the nominee is they strongly condemn them and fight back by pointing out the blatant illegality and ethical failures of the Trump administration in hiring his own children who are woefully under qualified for the positions they hold the time for the moral high ground for Democrats needs to be over. As far as Biden lacking the mental fitness to run the country I fully agree although it should be said so does Trump and we would be a lot safer and more prosperous under Joe no doubt but it's a weakness they will exploit and I fear he would lose. More concerning though is the Republican and Democratic establishments conviction and premature coronation of Biden as the nominee. I hope it doesn't go that way. He is and always has been Republican light with policies and votes going back decades that hurt Democratic values and economically vulnerable people. He won't be able to beat Trump by offering him out behind the woodshed and mixing his lines up. Bernie would be able to as the polling has shown for months by having the mental conditioning of a much younger man and the guts to go where is needed with rhetoric. Shame all of the nominees are old men in their swan songs and a shame so many people are frightened of the only Democratic candidate that espouses traditional Democratic values Joe leaning to the left now is disengenuous and risible.
[comment]I've seen some of this on Reddit already and I'm wondering if it is coming from Russian sources.

[comment]&gt;a bumbling candidate who lacks the mental fitness to run the country.
 Hahshahhahaha Trump is one to talk..no surprise he said this.
[comment]I mean he is bumbling.
[comment]For those of you that are saying that you can't believe what the attacks are going to be like later on here's how it's going to be, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Joe Biden has been around for 40 years, Donald j drumpf has been around in politics going on for years, the dear leader has just as many gaffs and MORE fuck ups than Joe Biden does so that's how it's going to be, the Democrats are going to throw the same shit and then some right back at the orangutan looking POS that we have in Washington because Donald j drumpf deserves everything and then some he gets for being such a right-wing piece of garbage that only cares about himself and not the American people.
[comment]That's been happening for the last year or so.
[comment]They are working on me. I’m voting Dems no matter what but I’ve seen the videos and Biden DOES sound like he’s losing brain function terribly. It’s why I’ve doubled my efforts in phone banking for Sanders. I literally just see him as a slam dunk on Trump.
[comment]That last part is rich, considering we have a bumbling idiot who lacks the mental fitness to run a country currently running the country.

He's also been building ground operations in every state - and will give those to whoever the nominee is, even if it's not him. I don't want him as president, but his money *is* helping us.
[comment]I’m surprised he didn’t just walk off stage. How embarrassing! Warren just proved that she can handle a misogynistic idiot better than anyone.
[comment]This is like that one episode where Piper Perri got surrounded
[comment]He sucks so bad. I was mad that he was being allowed on the debate stage and after tonight I'm happy he was allowed on. Now everyone can see him for what he is. An old out of place rich man who has no clue as to what the american people want or like.
[comment]I actually felt badly for him.     He looked like he was going to cry.  Its sad!!   Whether or not you were planning on voting for him/like him the guy IS a legitimate businessperson and smart as heck (although he didn't come off this way).   He also didn't bully other candidates back (i.e. Trump).
[comment]I never liked Bloomberg jumping into the race, right from the very start. He's way to business as usual for me. But this actually made me feel sorry for the poor bastard.
[comment]You see how fast Mikey's eyes are blinking? How much he stammers to force out an answer that he had to come up with on the spot? He's not ready for primetime, and he never will be. All of the money in the world will never change that fact, because money isn't what makes you an ideal candidate. What makes you an ideal candidate is to not be a festering bag of shit.
[comment]I am wondering who, if anyone, Bloomberg will support with his $ if he drops out.  I think Amy and Pete are the only ones who didn't absolutely destroy Bloomberg.

Hurr Durr. Don't divide democrats lmao
[comment]That was both satisfying and painful to watch. No thanks Bloomberg, weve already got one billion dollar bonehead in there White House. 

 No need for another.
[comment]Let’s be real here. His misconduct was out there before this debate. His supporters aren’t the type of people who watch the debates, they’re the type of people who judge based on political ads that come on during their favorite shows. He won’t pick up any new supporters from his performance tonight but I doubt he’ll lose many
[comment]This dude brought 300k to a knife fight and didn’t think he’d get stabbed. I bet he’s feeling a little MeToo’d right now, gonna need everyone to sign an NDA after his performance tonight.
[comment]"they were made consensually" 

The exact same argument Harvey Weinstein is making, what a joke.
[comment]No one went after Sanders, at all. So the race is exactly where it was yesterday. Sanders is going to cruise to the nomination
[comment]Now that the intervention is over its time to get on with life.
[comment]Nobody can possibly watch this and take anything positive out of Bloomberg’s performance. The man was actively being booed by the crowd whenever he talked.
[comment]I need a clip of this on my workout playlist.
[comment]Didn’t realize Bloomberg had three anuses: his natural one, the one on his face where all the shit comes out, and the new one that Warren ripped him last night!
[comment]This debate was like a trial run at how these guys would debate Trump. Sanders, Warren and even Biden looked like killers tonight. Especially, Warren she absolutely left bodies on the ground. 

Pete looked like a guy who didn’t want to anger the guy with the money too much. 

Klobichar looked like a parent who was going to abuse her middle school child when they got home for talking back to her in public
[comment]Wow, skewered, you can literally watch him shrink into himself like a little troll.
[comment]Please tag nsfw because of elder abuse
[comment]I can’t forgive stop and frisk at all. And all those NDAs with all the women who want to come forward?!? And he’s so transphobic too
[comment]I really think he’s there to save the Democrats from going full left and alienating the public into voting Trump in for another four years
[comment]“binders full of women!”
[comment]Big props to Bernie Sanders here for not engaging in the personal mudslinging and bringing it back to policy at the end. There's a reason why this dude would be a great leader but a not so great politician. The man has class
[comment]Why everybody envy someone who tries to get ahead ..is nobody get rich then the only rich people would be the old money...no upper middle class just poor n rich....So now is anybody going to hate me for having a couple of millions in the bank which i work hard for it..Or they would be happy to see me getting food stamp n Medicaid like most deplorables do...Envy is not a good trade!!!!
[comment]As god as my witness, he is broken in half
[comment]That wad brutal af to even watch
[comment]I feel like every pther candidate got together before the debate and said "let's take this fucking guy out tonight"
[comment]He'll keep going on.  He's rich, entitled, and immune to the criticism.
[comment]Not wasted. I think he should keep the ads making fun of trump rolling.
[comment]That was the longest curb theme song I’ve ever heard.
[comment]#OnlyBernieBeatsTrump2020 Warren and all the rest have to many skeletons in their closets. And their all running on Bernie lite anyway. No thank you I will take my Revolution strait up from the source.
[comment]He got destroyed. But, people are idiots. Lets just hope he doesn't do well when the votes are casts.  Trump got murdered also in debates.
[comment]Massive donation to the sanders campaign
[comment]Someone needs to make/share a subtitled facebook video showing all of the bad bloomberg debate clips back-to-back, so the boomers that get all their debate deets from FB can see he's not the person from his ads.
[comment]As seen on the internet - that man brought a wallet to a knife fight.
[comment]That is the face of a man who's realizing he just blew a quarter billion dollars to get roasted onstage.
[comment]“They want to keep it quiet” - keep “it” quiet? What event do they want to keep quiet?? Does he realize his wording makes him seem even more like he has something to hide?
[comment]He was absolutely destroyed, I bet he won't make it through march
[comment]Biggly
[comment]News Media- "If Bloomberg keeps paying us for ads, he will recover from this"
[comment]Did you ever see a more disinterested looking guy as Bloomberg was last night?  That said, IF he is the nominee, I’ll vote for him as Trump MUST go!
[comment]He deserves to be NAILED for these non disclosure agreements and Trump does as well.  Keep your eyes on the prize Trump's figurative head on a pike.
[comment]That was beautiful, get this Republican pos poser out of here.  If he was so scared of Bernie he should have injected money into his opponent's campaigns, but now he has radically increased the likelihood of Bernie having enough delegates in July to prevent a brokered convention.
[comment]I really hope there is polling post this debate and prior to Saturday's caucus. Bloomberg's numbers are likely to drop ten points. I think Sanders holds steady or gains a point or two and Warren gains five points or more.
[comment]I haven't seen a murder like that since the Charles Manson cultists hit the Tate house.
[comment]I think he did fine but then I don’t use Twitter where I need to be told by others how to think, so there’s that.
[comment]If he can’t handle Warren, he has no business getting in the ring with Trump. 

Hillary took the high road too often in the debates; I am so looking forward to watching someone who can swing back
[comment]Has more money than all the previous presidents combined, tells everyone else what to do with their money.... Pay for the free school and healthcare your self and I will not for you
[comment]LOL...Glad to see that a lot of Democrats can also see Mikey, for what he is.

Can I ask a quick question please?

Why do Democrats keep shooting themselves in the foot?
[comment]Fuck Mikey Boomburp
[comment]Did anyone catch what the hecklers were saying when Biden began his closing statement?  I couldn't make out what they were trying to say.  I did hear the Biden supporters begin to counter-chant, "Joe! Joe!" to try to drown them out.  But I didn't hear what the protesters/hecklers were yelling to begin with.  Anyone know?
[comment]Biden with that old man arm grab haha
[comment]He's still in it. He's still taking votes from mostly moderates, he is a spoiler, good for Trump and Sanders. Bad for Pete Joe and Amy
 Its ironic how he argues how last night was good for Trump, well he is the reason
[comment]It's funny listening to commercials that Bloomberg raised salaries 43% for teachers... In what reality? I taught in New York City under his reign.   He was awful for teachers and teacher salaries
[comment]Why the hell is he doing this to himself? Lmao

[comment]Bloomberg: "I can't be sexist, I have a female friend."
[comment] Bloomberg is a terrible candidate. Why would he waste so much money when he has so much political baggage.
[comment]Poor Mini Mike
[comment]He got his ass handed to him and it only cost him 50 billion$
[comment]Absolutely love the fact that he thought he'd just walk on stage and own the debate because he bought his way there. NOPE! He got what he deserved.
[comment]The debate performance means very little. He’ll still blanket the airwaves to rewrite the narrative about his debate performance. As long as he can convince people that he will be a good leader, they won’t care about his debate performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]"Ever wonder why Trump supporters ignore his countless lies? Because they think like 5 year olds"
[selftext]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYnHE6kfsaM[comment]Yeah sums these Troglodytes pretty good
[comment]Great video. It is so true that people don't care about the lies. Tried to convince my office that a leader speaking truth on TV matters and they just reply with "all of them lie." It's so disappointing and frustrating. 

Unfortunately I don't think Biden can effectively do what the video suggests against the incumbent.
[comment]Yup I don't know how this guy does it.
[comment]Well done.
[comment]They tend to say “it doesn’t matter “ and that they know what he means/meant but seriously he doesn’t know what he means so how can they????
[comment]that doesn't make sense.  if they aren't using logic and reason to support Trump, hitting back with policy won't do jack shit.    They don't care.

Ya gotta use emotion, and the one thing those people understand is being mocked and laughed at.  Biden's 'world leader's are laughing at us' is powerful because of this.   You don't have to 'go low', just have to show reality.  But he'll still get about 40% of the vote, no matter what.
[comment]You know what else suck’s?
[comment]Because they're liars.
[comment]I don't really buy that in that it's endemic to Republican followers. I've seen my share of Democrat asshatery.
[comment]It would ba a shame if democratic party would have the candidate that is electable rather than the candidate with substance and policy...
[comment]Nothing anyone does is ever going to move the needle below 32%. That’s all he needed last election. What we need is to reach people who normally don’t vote or who flipped from Bernie to trump last time. That’s it. Little else is worth discussing.
[comment]I disagree with the video.  Policies won't win over trump voters because they don't care about policies.  They just want to win.  They see it's a my team vs your team and they don't care how they get the W.
[comment]Fox News does this also. Tune in at any random moment and chances are you will get very little factual information, and endless appeals to your emotional logic- mainly anger and a sense of injustice and victimization. No matter what is happening in the world, you are the victim and trump is the victim. Trumps been the victim of the covid crisis on Fox since day one, regardless of the fact that his handling of it has cost countless people their lives- them of course being the actual victims. I guess there’s really no way to combat this unless you can somehow force their viewers to be smarter.

So what was the point of humiliating all those kids with IQ tests since the beginning of modern education?

What am I missing here?
[comment]I think people like know that he's lying, but they feel like they're lying with him to other people, not being lied to.
[comment]Wow. Although Trump and his supporters are far worse, this person's reasoning here is actually rather poor! It really needs to be gone over. Ditto psychiatrists in general as regards Trump, and the most prevalent psychiatric and lay diagnosis of "narcissism". It's amazing that such a thoughtful sounding analysis (if that's what it is; it's really more of a summary of things) can itself, in turn, be systematically flawed.

It's important to realize that people have been diagnosing the Trump phenomenon for as long as he's been in the public and political theaters. Not much of what she is saying is new. This general range of analyses has also been strikingly unsuccessful in budging his base. We really should hold the analyses at least suspect before assuming it's just an intractable problem. But that's a more general, superficial basis for questioning. An attentive listener can see more substantive reasons why her thinking here has serious problems.
[comment]Name Biden policies without mentioning Trump? 
Look this is why I tell people Biden already lost the general. No ground game, no phone banks, No support except msm astroturfing. To America, my land, I say Good Luck!
[comment]Eh, got through 60s of waiting for the point...
[comment]And they yell too.
[comment]The Brain development argument seems true. Have you ever tried to reason with a 5 year old who is having a fit?
[comment]let them roam around free, absolutely facilitate their public meetings and try not to discredit the president's opinion about drinking bleach or overexposing to UV. 

Just magically in a couple of months there will be definitely a lot less of these retards.
[comment]Well I wanted to watch it but then I saw TYT and said nevermind.
[comment]This is why I thought Warren was the best chance Democrats had to beat him.
[comment]President Tide Pods has lost it. He’s completely insane now.
[comment]What's funny is, if Obama did ANY of what Trump has done Republicans would be marching on Washington calling for him to be removed from office. It never ceases to amaze me how much what people think change when a Republican is the one doing it.
[comment]As a people we cultivated and allowed these adults to develop this way and now we get what we deserve.
[comment]Good video, although the last minute or so with her analysis on Hillary’s loss is ridiculous.
[comment]We need to build time-out centers in every shitty backwater town where these inbreeds show they’ve learned that the only difference between being five and being an adult is that you can get away with being a dickhead as an adult. There’s no way to win with idiots.
[comment]Yes.  There is a role for policy and strategy which he won't understand or be able to counter.

But I agree with Bill Maher that Dems need to be less nice.  Trump is going to hit below that belt pretty hard.  He banks on his opponents weaknesses and shadiness.  To think we can remain "better than him" morally and kinder and expect to win is crazy.  Dems need to sling some mud too...and he's given us mountains of it to fling right back at him!
[comment]Trump is a product of right-wing media, stop blaming the people. He is just a symptom of a greater problem, Neo-Liberals and Liberals attacking each other will not help to win the battle against right-wing media.
[comment]Of course. Appeal to emotion. Cognitive dissonance between feelings of inadequacy and superiority. It’s the same with conspiracy theory nuts, cultism and religion.  Its typically just a way of resolving ones inadequate self image with their desired image. 

Very simply, it’s just people trying to make themselves feel better about themselves. “Team trump”. “#winning”. “Own the libs”

You see it in republican policies too. It’s always about not letting anyone else get anything extra. It’s about applying negative consequences to others. 

Its people with damaged egos. It’s pretty easy to see. 

“I don’t care if it’s true; it makes me feel better” 

Also, side note. It sure sounds like the suggested solution to fight trump is exactly what Bernie Sanders is. Fight with policy and details.
[comment]1. Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of 3 Million. She lost the Electoral College and she lost it by less than a million votes in states that are usually a Democratic win, like Pennsylvania and Michigan.

2. The voters who support Trump no matter what, who show up to his rallies, who proudly wear their MAGA hats everywhere, the DEPLORABLES, make up only 50% or less of Trump supporters. WE CANNOT WIN THEIR SUPPORT and shouldn't even try.

3. The voters we can appeal to are the ones who voted for Obama, but either voted for Trump OR DIDN'T VOTE AT ALL. They are the people who hated Trump, but voted for him because they hated Clinton more. 

I never understood why so many people hated Hillary on such a personal level, but I can't deny they exist. That was baggage that IMHO, made her a bad candidate. 

I don't think there is a big group of Biden haters. I don't think he has that kind of baggage. I don't think most people really care about Hunter Biden. The sexual assault allegations are disturbing, but even if they are true, compared the Trump, Biden is a choir boy.

The Electoral College is a terribly unfair system and always has been. We're stuck with it until they can pass a constitutional amendment against it, and that's not going to happen any time soon. Ultimately, Biden needs to appeal to swing voters in swing states and we need a strong GOTV effort. The wider margin we can win by, the harder it will be for Trump and the GOP to cheat their way to a win.
[comment]I posted another comment but I decided to let this one stand alone. 

This information is not a surprise. It’s the fundamental pillar of their entire strategy. All the misinformation and attempts to shape public opinion so blatantly. 

It started with Steve Bannon and World of Warcraft. He realized there exists a population of people who feel like they aren’t good enough or the world is screwing them over. This original group was the Incels on World of Warcraft. 

Bannon realized these people would manipulate their reality in order to make themselves look better to others, and feel better about themselves. After all, pretending, lying or fabricating a whole life story is pretty easy anonymously on the internet. 

So he created Cambridge Analytica. This combined with existing misinformation systems, namely Russian Internet Agency, was a great weapon to manipulate people into achieving your own goals. 

It’s truly fascinating how effective this has worked, and frightening what may come in the future.

Edit:  their image of trump is a rich and famous person who has power over everyone and gets to “stick it” to those who “are mean” to him.  If I become rich and famous and powerful, “I can finally make other people feel crappy about themselves, like I do.”  “I can finally feel like I am better than others.”  This is the ultimate dream of his supporters. 

It’s like a kid who was bullied In school dreaming of becoming a famous fighter.
[comment]Oh yeah, anyone who has discussed anything political with a trump cultist irl finds that out real quick when they stop trying to have any kind of coherent discussion and go into full spittle flinging rage yelling while waving their hands.
[comment]Did she just say that Trump supporters have the reasoning of a 5 year old, rely on emotion, don't listen to reason.... and the only way to combat that is with substance and policy?

If they don't listen to substance and don't care about policy, how is countering Trump with substance and policy a winning strategy?
[comment]Honestly they aren't even human beings. They are a disease that must be destroyed before it can spread
[comment]Yeah! Hillary never lied!
[comment]My dad can beat up your dad!!
[comment]I'm going to disagree. Facts are good, but the trumpie cultists also need to be publicly shamed and humiliated. People need to laugh at them. This will deter the weakminded from joining them.
[comment]"When you are overcome with powerlessness, this type of cartoonish, exaggerated force is often more important than true ability".

You have to make fun of him and make him appear weak.
[comment]No, they act stupid like trumbo because he gives them license to, been like that since the election 😆
[comment]Oh Biden’s definitely losing then
[comment]That's me - "CRYY... 'in. The blues!"
[comment]The sad thing is, appealing with policy doesn't work. Bernie appealed with policy. Voters who supported Trump in 2016 don't care about policy. It doesn't appeal to them. If it did, they wouldn't have voted for a candidate whose entire platform was built on identifying and eradicating an "other".

The only surefire way to convince Trump voters to abandon him is for them to feel like he's abandoned them. Unfortunately, COVID-19 may well have that effect by virtue of killing tens of thousands of people.

As much as I want stay-at-home orders to remain in effect until the threat is manageable, the political consequence of a secondary or even tertiary spike in the death toll is that voters likely to make an emotional decision in the voting booth will feel abandoned. It shouldn't take a massive death toll to make these folks see reality, but I don't think any other threat can have that effect.

You can't shoot a virus. You can't vote against it. You can't write a law to stop it or make a deal with disease. There's no military or policy action that makes it go away.
[comment]I really think she came to the wrong conclusion.  As the first parts of the video explain, Trump's supporters don't care about substance, they care about the appearance of power.  They care about the way he makes them feel strong after having spent so long feeling weak.  Clearly the long way to beat Trump is to empower these people in some other more constructive way and clearly the short way to beat Trump is to have him publicly cast down in such a way that his illusion of power is forever shattered in the eyes of his followers.
[comment]So.... Bernie then?????
[comment]This is an insult to my 5 year old daughter.  She’s way more emotionally intelligent than that.
[comment]Cuomo already knows how to do this. I hope Biden gets it.
[comment]it would have been more effective to keep interviewing trump supporters
[comment]Most of them have the intellect of a 5 year old.
[comment]I have VERY little respect for Trump and his blind followers who can’t think for themselves. Maybe I will if they can advance their thinking to at LEAST a 10-year-old’s level, but now? Can’t stand them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Joe Biden on Twitter: I don't care who you're supporting, attacks like this against a man who could be the first Jewish President are disgusting and beyond the pale. Hatred and bigotry have no place in America — and it's up to all of us to root out these evils wherever they're found.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1236023348481724416[comment]Amen.
[comment]Well said, Joe. 

We may disagree on policy or who the better candidate is, but what happened at that rally is what we all, no matter what side of the party you align with, are fighting against: racism, bigotry, hatred, and fascism. I stand behind either candidate and the objective of taking down Donald Trump and purging this government of his toxic criminal influence.
[comment]Amen Joe.
[comment]Like Republicans Joe? Like Republicans?
[comment]Now if only Bernie would shut down those BernieBots...
[comment]This is the unity Joe brings. Thank you!
[comment]100% agree, just wish it had come sooner.
[comment]Great words. It's time we got above this crap. 

Problem is with the interwebs, some of it is catfishing.
[comment]This shows what a decent man he is. This is the man we want in the White House, not our current nightmare
[comment]Thanks, Joe.
Still voting Bernie
[comment]Joe has my vote!
[comment]This was strategic but still a good thing to do.  Thanks Joe.

Still voting Bernie
[comment]Correct.
[comment]When are people going to wake up and realize all this hate, bigotry, racism, homophobia talk is just a tactic. It’s working too and that’s why it has so much power. If people would quit buying into it then maybe we could all move forward. I live in the South and I’ve met Very few actual racist/homophobes types and the ones I have everyone all agrees they suck, but it’s very uncommon! Except on the news......think about it
[comment]hatred and bigotry are all the right has. its the theme of every one of trumps klan rallies
[comment]Wonder what Trump 's tweet about it would be
[comment]Joe's quickly becoming electable
[comment]Seems like a stunt.  Who was that guy ans what was he paid?
[comment]I don't know where the original story is but just r by eading some of the posts I can tell what it was about, but the best thing that I read other than Joe biden's comment is the Bernie supporters that said they would support whoever is the nominee. No bulshit, this is the first time that I've seen on Reddit or anywhere else that Bernie backers will back the nominee no matter who it is and this is what the Democratic party is all about. The main goal is to get the orange orangutan looking POS out of office,and the only way we can do that is if we unite as a party no matter who the nominee is. This is the last thing I always say after a post, if Bernie wins Democrats that didn't vote for him get some of what they want, if Biden wins the Democrats that didn't vote for him get something they want, but if the orange wannabe dictator wins we get nothing we want!! DEMOCRATS STICK TOGETHER!!
[comment]Thanks, Joe.  👍

I will vote for you and fight hard for you if you win, but I'm still primarying Bernie.
[comment]This is what a real man looks like. joe biden has mine vote. Does he have yours?

Vote BLUE NO MATTER WHO. unite to fight the alt right.
[comment]Bernie was all about unity at his rally tonight too.  He did a good job of saying “we’re in this together and he has my support but here’s why I’m better.”  They’re aware of what R u ss i a is doing and doing a great job of combatting it.  Remember that.  If it seems divisive, consider it before agreeing flatly with it.
[comment]To bad he can't say a sentence this eloquently.
[comment]I’m happy that he’s being classy and humble. That’s the only way we can defeat trump. Unity
[comment]I voted for Warren. No regrets. And no matter which of these two wins the primary, I have money and and volunteer time ready to go during the run up to the general. This is the most important election of my life as an eligible voter.
[comment]Tell 'em, Joe!
[comment]We have to pull together and vote for the nominee. Even if it’s Biden. I hate these nazi scumbags and especially that nazi pos in the WH
[comment]I'm not supporting Biden in the primaries, but this right here is the reason why we have to support him if he becomes the nominee. The difference between him and Trump could not be more clear.
[comment]Found directly at the Whitehouse in Washington DC where the orange maggot lives
[comment]I see people talking about Elizabeth Warren and to be honest I don't agree with all her policies but I don't agree with all of anyone's 100%, but she's closer to what I would vote for if I wasn't voting for Biden and that's because she is an extremely smart person and she's a hell of a debater she's not afraid to tell people what she's really thinking and I respect that in a person whether male or female, and I also said and some of you may disagree but some of you may agree, I think if Biden were to win the nomination he needs to pick a woman as a running mate and I said he should take Warren that way we keep the progressive happy and the moderates happy and can possibly phase in some of the progressive things that people are looking for but then I'm thinking of another woman named Stacey Abrams from Georgia who ran for governor and got it stolen from her but the only drawback I see from Stacey Abrams is that she ran for governor and lost, and I don't know if shes held office before in Georgia or not and another thing is I believe Joe Biden has the African American vote as of now which any Democrat that runs for office needs and Stacey Abrams could possibly bring in the womens vote that any Democrat running also needs, but Elizabeth Warren brings a different part of the party in which expands it to voters that wouldn't normally vote for Biden or that side of the party but in closing I don't think he can go wrong with either choice but it has to be a woman.
[comment]I had no idea he was Jewish
[comment]The comments which are now deleted were vile. I'm disheartened. If you cannot look at a man condemning anti-Semitism and say simply say "Good": Fuck you, you don't belong in this party.
[comment]Good!

I like Joe but I don't think he can beat trump and I worry about his memory.  

But the above message is exactly the thing Trump should be saying.  It's how a leader behaves!

Well done Joe and while you're on a role...

...Biden own campaign recently told Sanders, Nina Turner , shouldn't be using Martin Luther King Jr  quotes which is kind of ...let's say odd.  

So I'd next like to see Biden explain that behaviour , as again that is the type of action we need to see from potential leaders. 

 Stop all the racism and bigotry from the top up!
[comment]This was a tough one, but Joe found the courage to step up and say nazis are bad, regardless of who he might offend. That’s presidential behavior right there.
[comment]I wonder if he apologized to the woman he called, "lying, dog faced, pony solider", or for fondly reminiscing about being so civil with white segregationists or for the Biden buckaroos harassing Warren supporters in the past.  He is a decent man, but has always been at the bottom of my list.
[comment]I voted for Bernie in my primary, but I will definitely vote for Biden if he becomes the nominee. My first choice is Bernie, but I do admit I worry about whether or not the Medicare for All pitch will do well in the general election. I like the idea myself, but America doesn’t like huge changes like that.
[comment]What were the attacks?
[comment]Nicely said Joe. I can’t vote or anything (and sorry, would vote for sanders in the primary if I could), but still, nice.
[comment]Niw here is a decent man who in despite of his attacks from Sanders still defend Sanders jewish ancestry...would Sanders do the same? ??? NO
[comment]We need to unite and rally behind whoever gets the nomination. We have one single goal thisncycle: defeat trumpism. 
  
Also, saving the ACA and pre-existing conditions.
  
And stopping the stacking of the courts.
 
And restoring environmental regs.

And tackling climate change.
  
I mean: I want Medicare for all but I’ll be a fucking deadman if I lose my ACA coverage.
  
Put your main effort into your local, state, senate and house candidates. If you can get someone to to polls for the senator, they’re going to vote the D at the top of the ticket too.
[comment]And people say antisemitism doesn't exist.
[comment]Warren’s dropping out broke my heart, but I am also voting Blue no matter who.
ABT!
[comment]Well said Joe. I really liked how Bernie handled it too. I think you are out numbered.
[comment]Can anybody explain to me why Joe Biden has 8 sexual harassment allegations against him?

<|startoftext|>[title]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how pathetic and awful a significant amount of republicans are?
[selftext]Like it was obvious before but Jesus now it’s slapping you in the face. The protests, the shooting, the denial of basic science, the worship of trump blatantly without any backing, the insecurity, it really shows it off.[comment]Yes
[comment]No, we already knew that. This just confirms it.
[comment]Not exposed; just confirmed it in bright neon.
[comment]It confirms that many Republicans have decided to listen to their lesser angels, stop thinking, go with their emotions and follow an insane cult leader to where ever he takes them next.
[comment]Karma will surely serve them a plate of covefe 19...😆
[comment]This is literally all they've ever been. Even the corporate sellouts in our camp have the decency to at least pretend they care about human life.
[comment]Hatefulness has a political party. It's never been more obvious.
[comment]Yes. I’ve been trying to assume the point of view of trumpists/republicans and I caught myself thinking: The way we view them is most likely the way they view us. They’re incapable of seeing the light. They look at us like we’re the bad guys just like we view them. Just a thought.
[comment]Yes. The surprise is how many Democrats this has exposed as not having the best interests of the people or the Democratic process in mind. Our system is truly broken and beyond repair.
[comment]They deserve to lose every election for the next hundred years. As it is, we will be lucky to squeeze out four years of doing next to nothing to halt their eventual progress.
[comment]I think it was perfectly obvious before Covid-19...but maybe that's just me? 🤔
[comment]You could have groups shooting people in the streets and there would still be a good amount of money and power supporting them because it's more profitable to have the American people fighting each other
[comment]Of the two parties- only the GOP tries to suppress the vote. Limit voting places, eliminate vote by mail, cut hours, get rid of existing early voting... the ID law is “problematic” but really its about suppressing the vote. Winning in that way- cheating- is without honor.
[comment]C19 has VALIDATED HOW COMPLETELY VILE THE REPEWBS ARE.    BLUE WAVE!
[comment]Just par for the course really. Money rules that party and you are a means for them to get richer. 

If anything, I hope it made people realize that the party is supposed to work for us and not the other way around. 

As well, the rich showed everyone that we’re worth a hell of a lot more that what we’re getting paid!
[comment]I mean, basically everything that has happened in the last 4 years has shown that. This is par for the course.
[comment]Absolutely. And I hope we don’t forget it once we get Trump out of office. We might be friendly for now with “moderate Republicans” who hate Trump, but DO NOT forget how their worldview is based on dangerous nonsense as well. 

Healthcare is a human right. Climate change is real. Immigrants make our country stronger in nearly every way. Women have a right to their own bodies. Voting rights matter. The GOP denied these fundamental truths long before Trump took office and they will do so even after he leaves.
[comment]It was already confirmed. This just reinforces it.
[comment]From my perspective, it's just been pouring lemon juice marinated salt into the gaping wound. However to the uninformed voter or blatantly partisan GOP voter I feel this won't even remotely be a blip on their radar, it's all some conspiracy to down Trump or some shit
[comment]I don’t think it needed confirmation.
[comment]I don't think anyone has the market cornered on bad decisions. Covid 19 just adds insult to injury.
[comment]They really have shown their true colors
[comment]Coronavirus isn't in human form and they can't apply the politics of personal destruction to something that can't speak, show compassion to marginalized people, or convey ideas that would make lives better for more than the super rich.

There is no straw man that can be made here.  It doesn't care about your politics and it also can't be vilified so Skeeter can say he's mad it wore a tan suit or "What about the coronavirus's emails?!!" in a feigned fit of outrage.
[comment]We as Democrats need to FINALLY grow a sack and play the game on the same terms as they are or they will just continue on doing whatever the hell they want as they have been doing since the 1970’s.....😔
[comment]Conservatives subreddit is absolute cancer
[comment]Yes! A lot of Trumpicans can't bear the thought that their leader has fumbled this crisis hard so they shun reality and the science behind it. And as we've seen from the armed protests and two pipebomb arrests, they're willing to get real nasty with their beliefs. To say the least, It's a scary time in America and I'm worried if/when Biden wins in November. I have a feeling Trump isn't relinquishing power easily.
[comment]Republicans have been this awful my entire life. I feel like younger people just were totally not exposed to them on such a massive scale under the previous 8 years of Obama.
[comment]The insecurity is borne by the realization that this is the nail in Trump's coffin. Up till the coronavirus, nothing seemed to stick to Trump. This crisis has laid that bare his ineptitude and every poll shows him losing badly to Biden. They are freaking out and will only get more strident.
[comment]Known for a while now
[comment]You better VOTE!!!
[comment]We already knew lol. We can only hope it’s been exemplified to those who are more moderate. I think what’s it’s really shown is blind loyalty to party lines, with complete and total disregard for human lives. 

People and politicians who are acting like total a**holes in all of this. The ones disobeying mandates, violating and compromising the health and well-being of others, simply to “shove it” in the face of Democrats. It is pathetic and awful. How many lives have been lost as a result of it? We’ve definitely seen the ugly side of humanity in all of this.
[comment]I wasn’t surprised just very, very irked. You see, I literally prayed that no crisis would happen with this administration because they would literally make matters much, much worse. They have far exceeded my expectations.


Pls Vote in November.
[comment]It's been obvious for a while but this has hopefully exposed how awful conservatives are to anybody who was considering voting against their own best interests and voting for them
[comment]It exposed just how terrible our government as a whole is. To say one half did amazing while the other half did piss poor is quite off base. It’s not cute when they’re in Washington bickering like children over legislation. They all get a huge thumbs down from me.
[comment]Thing that gets me is the fear based denial. And then they'll roll over and play the victim just to blame you for exercising a measured response for dealing with the fearful reality of a global pandemic.
[comment]The mental gymnastics required to support Trump and his boot-lickers at this point are truly mind boggling.
[comment]Yes. Yes I do.
[comment]Pressure exposes patterns.
[comment]"Your deaths for rich people are a sacrifice I am more than willing to make." /Republicans more or less (Probably)
[comment]I don't think it's fair to compare as Democrat vs Republican. I typically vote red but I'm still at home and don't agree with the protesting idiots and I also wouldn't call myself a republican. I think a significant amount of those "republicans" are just people who operate from their lower brain and spout Trump as their savior. Can you really be so far in one camp or the other to label yourself?

I guess my thought is that I wish people were more idea/policy leaning than red/blue team leaning. I've never voted a straight ticket...
[comment]Nah, I’ve always known.
[comment]Depends on how sensitive you are to this sort of thing.

If you are highly sensitive, the way they handled Monica Lewinsky would have tipped you off.

If you were just sensitive, the way Bush handled 9/11 and the Iraq War would have tipped you off.

If you were moderately interested but not sensitive to this sort of thing at all, the financial crisis and the nomination of Sarah Palin as Veep candidate would have tipped you off.

If you had a passing interest, the way they reacted to Barack Obama should have tipped you off.

If your interest wasn't passing but you had any awareness, their backing of the Orange Shitgibbon and his actions prior to Covid-19 should have tipped you off.

If you don't know by now either you are one of them or you have your head up your ass and like it there, because nothing bad ever comes to your ears.
[comment]I think the absolute craziest part for me is that there are people out there that not only are on with this but support it in a full throated manner
[comment]Yes. Everyday Every second Every issue
[comment]I think it’s exposed how pathetic and awful a lot of people are
[comment]All. All of them.
[comment]Hey, what did they do to the CDC? I'm serious. They have been muzzled. I see a 70+ year old man who constantly respeats himself &amp; occasionally a doctor or 2, but why hasn't the CDC been on TV?
[comment]Imagine you could see all the headlines of just this year about what the GOP and trump has done during the 2016 election. 

Think “Her Emails” would have been an issue?
[comment]I’ve seen quite a bit of bigotry of late. Almost exclusively from my non democrat friends. I was surprised at how many self described independents have hate as well
[comment]Ok, I'll bite. 

I'm probably closest to a republican as things go... How does this expose anything?
[comment]I think Trump did that. Before he came along I thought they deserved a seat at the table.
[comment]You're just saying that because you want your party to be in power.

/S
[comment]No. Definitely not. It exposed how underestimating we we were.
[comment]I agree with the general sentiment, but Biden is still running for President and still does not support Medicare for all, even as hundreds of thousands die from Covid, many of them un or under insured. I’d say the Republicans are not the only ones who have been exposed.
[comment]Conservative here. There is a reason I call myself a conservative and not a republican. The Republican Party platform contradicts itself on so many instances I just can’t. I still hold right wing views, but I actually try not to contradict my own beliefs unlike the people in DC.
[comment]it has shown me how pathetic ALL our politicans are.  driven by party politics and greed.
[comment]I’m not sure you noticed, but they elected a human toilet after previously electing/not electing the world most dangerous nerf ball for two illegitimate terms
[comment]It shows that both parties don't care about us. Not just Republicans. Do you guys really think the Democrats are working for you and not there corporate donors?
[comment]You mean every day*
[comment]Every damn week, they find a new bottom.
[comment]Whats just as bad is people believing whatever they are told. This ridiculous "Plandemic" video has gotten me in trouble with family because it makes me so angry that they watch and believe what these nutjobs are saying!
[comment]Every day the indecency is more obvious. If Americans were really the kind of people that I grew up thinking they were, the GOP would be obliterated NOW.
[comment]People in general...
[comment]No .
[comment]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how stupid and awful a significant amount of Democrats are?
[comment]Lol you're just speaking the truth based on facts.

No think.

The covid massacre has shown 1) how fucking dangerous China under xi really is.  2) that trump really has no empathy.  3) that his supporters are brainwashed and or evil.  4) the gop are fucking terrorists and traitors who put human life after personal gain.  5) America is heading towards it's 3rd civil war.
[comment]I feel like it’s not fair to make a general statement that states all republicans are like this. While I disagree with many, and think some are complete fucking idiots. I think the same thing for some of the people in the other parties as well. There are stupid people everywhere, and good people from both sides exist.


But yeah, the people protesting, fuck them, absolute cunts to be honest. Also trump worshippers need to cease existing and as a side note, who the fuck protests their second amendment rights while protesting a quarantine?
[comment]No I’ve know for near thirty years how gross pathetic and awful republicans and conservatives are. They are a blight and cancer on this nation and in their own way a population forcing the rest of us to be better and confront the awfulness that is a hallmark of their ideology.
[comment]Have you seen r/trump? My god the people on that sub are small but make up for it ok stupidity.
[comment]just wondering what platform they will campaign on in future elections. they have flipped on everything.no morals,abortion,military/injured vets,law enforcement,health insurance. hell, i can't think of one thing oh,one thing, enriching wall street.
[comment]I really want to caution anyone who will listen from adopting this attitude. At the end of the day, we are all citizens of this country, and we have to figure out a way to work together to overcome obstacles. 

Are there some really shorty republicans elected officials right now? I would say yes. This is most likely due to the fact that republicans more commonly get elected, and received a lot of the money from the early days of lobbying, now just about anyone with a seat of power gets paid to make decisions.

We the people are the ones who control whether these officials get to remain in power, and alienating our fellow citizens is no way to go about effecting change. I encourage everyone to be open minded, and try to understand where the rhetoric comes from. It may not being what you agree with, and it may be preachy and shorty and unpleasant, but we all have humanity, and we all need to work together to overcome our hardships.
[comment]You know how they say that money doesn't change a person but rather exposed who they really are?  With covid-19, it's about how evil these sobs are. When you're willing to not give a shit about other people's lives and talk about sacrificing lives for the economy, that's just pure overt evil. I have always seen this potential in the GOP but to witness it played out on the grand stage is nothing short of remarkable.  I just know that they don't have any reasonable card carrying Republicans left. Anyone that still follows them to this point will never accept the truth or facts provided to them by Jesus himself. These are just zombies keeping the ship afloat while it's taking in water.
[comment]Covid-19 just reveals what’s been revealed time and again with Republicans not standing up to the Liar in Chief, not governing for the people, passing bills that benefit the wealthy, gerrymandering districts, suppressing voter turnout and turning a blind eye to the Mueller report, criminal indictments and impeachment. Their history is long. People are beginning to experience fatigue. Republicans were in such bad shape, they were the party Trump could attach to like a parasite.
[comment]The democrats should also be grouped into this
[comment]Especially Rush Limbaugh. His show became exclusively blame the left all day. 
I have listened to it for many years out of interest in the Republican arguments. It was fun to try and deconstruct his craziness and see how he attempted to influence his listeners in roundabout ways.
But now it's straight "the left is evil and wants to destroy America" all day, mixed with ads for diets or mattresses. No subtlety to it. 
Then I switch to NPR where they use facts and real people's stories...
[comment]Just read about Germans before World War Two. Republicanism is the same. A garbage culture fueled by ignorance and hatred.
[comment]Democrats too, not offering any real alternative to status quo.  That's why I'm going communist.  Not like my life was better under Obama.  I had to pay $2500 to an insurance company for shit insurance that was too expensive to actually use.  The wars didn't end, Bush wasn't prosecuted, Guantanimo Bay wasn't closed, police brutality against blacks only increased.
[comment]If the pandemic is the thing that finally is making you see that...fuck you...they have been heartless demons for years now...not that the dems do anything to really stop them though...
[comment]It's also exposed how weak and feckless most democratic leadership is as well. Fuck the republicans but damned if pelossi and shcumer arent more useless than tits on a fish.
[comment]Cancerous traitorous monsters
[comment]Nah it’s just confirmed that people priorities are whipping there ass and having a fashionable face mask I mean if you look at that way you shouldn’t have any political say lol if ya think about it we all live in the same place and should have similar goals and yet we have two parties with conflicting goals which leads one to ask why? Personally I think they in it together and use the media to divide people to obtain their personal goals so In away your halfway right but instead of keeping a better eye on one side how bout keeping full attention on the whole fuck show
[comment]I am 36. 

For me it was the Iraq War. For people before that it was Reagan. Bush 1 was, for Republicans, probably the last good one.
[comment]About 10% more than I felt I knew. But I think it's more public now
[comment]Trump is vowing to destroy Obamacare in a pandemic; we gave the most extensive distribution of wealth in history to billionaires, expanded executive power, etc. Wealth inequality has been increasing for a long time now, while Biden is far better than Trump, he will still increase wealth inequality. I don't like voting to be a serf, but I feel I don't have a choice.
[comment]I live in Salt Lake city, a democratic area for sure. But I work in southern Utah, and without knowing for sure I would imagine 80-90% of the people I work with are strong republicans. (one guy has a leftist tears mug lol). I really really try not to take a generic view of "republican bad, Democrat good". But God damn if talking to them about current events doesn't just push me further into my beliefs. In team zoom calls we have guys saying it's unconstitutional and the company has to let them into the office, etc. Defending the gov blindly. Just the blatant lack of care for anybody other than yourself astounds me. 

It's almost as if being a selfish bastard is a requirement for the republican party these days.
[comment]It's almost like Mother Nature said 'you didnt get it with Irma, huh?'
[comment]Let's not forget the Dems too. Utter disappointment across the board. We need a new party that truly represents the working class.
[comment]Confirmed it for sure. Pure evil. One of my Pokémon friends left our 3 year group chat because we were complaining about the Rs
[comment]The huge number of Republican conservatives who don't believe the virus is real or that it's made by the government blows my mind. I have friends who call it the "plandemic."
[comment]Omg have you seen all their plandemic posts lately
[comment]You must be new here
[comment]Here's an idea. How about stop being so hateful just because people have different political views than you. This world will be better if people looked past these differences instead of this tribal partisan crap
[comment]Not really. It's always been pretty obvious to me.
[comment]I did Nazi this coming.

Seriously though, I don't see a world any time soon where unity is possible. We've tried to meet them in the middle many times over the years, but it's always involved throwing a vulnerable group under the bus, or being stabbed in the back by Republicans. Most of them WANT to hurt people. It makes them feel good, and they'll lie to your face to accomplish that. 

Unfortunately, there are a lot of centerists who will keep trying to stradle that line out of principle, or believing they're above partisan politics. And to be fair, a lot of us have Republican friends, neighbors, and family. It's difficult to accept that someone who you care about can be such a cruel human being.
[comment]I’m republican and even I question my own party. We’re protesting against science and bowing to a man who hasn’t helped, even a little... some members of my family even think this was a man made disease. I might be changing parties until Covid-19 blows over.
[comment]Not since Covid, since they all got behind Trump during the election. However, since this virus began I'm more disgusted than ever and ashamed that I was ever a part of the Republican party. Most of my friends are Republicans and some family members and they are all completely brainwashed.
[comment]Largely, although it’s important to point out that not all Republicans are scumbags or even necessarily Trump supporters. I know a few Republicans who are fairly moderate and might even vote D on some issues. 

I still think there has to be room for dissent from mainstream thought (which I believe leans more from moderate left to far left) but yeah, there seems to be a disproportionate number of scumbags within the ranks of the R party.
[comment]It highligts there low inteligece in extrem stiuations like this,
[comment]Democrats have been screaming hysterically for 3 years about nonsensical Russian conspiracy theories, have done nothing but waste time and money on fruitless investigations, and have been trying to sabotage the President's Covid response and you guys still support them?

You guys need to have your heads examined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]New Rule: Just because Fox News is obsessed with the Biden sex assault allegations, it doesn't mean the rest of us have to be.
[selftext]https://youtu.be/Ju1ZFuvjzYc[comment]#AMEN!
[comment]If only they covered the 25+ Trump accusations. It's a little less credible you are innocent when a dozen women accusing you isn't even half of the total number.
[comment]Well this was eye opening... 👁👁
[comment]I'd broaden that: just because cable TV news fixates on certain stories (those differ between networks) doesn't mean anyone else needs to fixate on them.

I recall a few years ago when Lawrence O'Donnell had Michael Avenati on his show almost daily.

What sells the most ads may not be what provides the best information for the citizenry.
[comment]And once again....right wingers and Bernie Bro’s team up. And no one can extrapolate this unholy alliance to the notion that Russian and the Trump administration is in cahoots to keep this shit relevant?

I sincerely find it amusing that the Limbaugh crowd constantly talks about right wingers having this almost supernatural ability for “Critical thinking”, but only as it applies to the “other party”.

I find it equally amusing that the “Feel the Bern” people are so “woke”...but cannot admit to it that they are being played.

The sad thing about the Bernie people? Is that they fell for it in 2016....they were so CONVINCED that Clinton had a sex trafficking ring in the basement of a pizza shop. You would think that they’d be “woke” enough to not fall for the same bullshit twice.

But....like the hard right? They are more married to their ideology than reality and finding the truth.
[comment]All aspects of these allegations from Reade are very suspicious not the least of which is "Why now when he is the presumptive nominee?"
[comment]Fuck this.....we should be obsessed
[comment]Alternatively we could hold our politicians accountable. Yeah fox should have given legitimate coverage to trumps numerous accusers. That doesn’t mean we just sweep inconvenient things under the rug because our political opponents have no dignity.
[comment]Let’s put trump’s accusations on the board, along with grab them by the pussy and he has been accused of raping an underage girl. 

Oh wait! His supporters don’t give a shit.
[comment]Man we can do better than this take.  This is cheesy af and we deserve to get blasted by the right for flipping so hard on women's issues.
[comment]They know he's a threat to defeat Trump, so clearly this is a scheme to lower his votes. Lmao, we all know this, hopefully it doesn't work that well though.
[comment]Trump has already shown he is willing to cheat and break the law and fabricate non-stories to smear Biden. Why should we believe anything they ~~make~~ dig up on him?
[comment]Omg all of you fuckers are saying the exact same thing trump's supporters are saying about his accusers.
[comment]The goal of the Bernie Bros is to destroy Joe Biden. The goal of Fox is to attack the rest of the media and scream "double standard!" over and over again.

The Democrats had better wake up. The Republicans plan on campaigning on Alternate Reality where the Mueller Report exonerated Trump, the impeachment was a partisan witch hunt, and Trump is blameless when it comes to the Governor's Little Problem.
[comment]Maybe the dems should not have a picked a vulnerable candidate again.
[comment]Is that Putin love letter real?
[comment]as a democrat we should 100% take this just as seriously as the allegations against trump. You can't just pick and choose like this
[comment]OR... we could prove ourselves to NOT be hypocrites and hold Biden just as accountable as we did Trump.
[comment]The hypocrisy of the Democrats has turned me so far away from the party. It's so disappointing. The Democratic party has as much integrity as rock. 

You should all be ashamed.
[comment]Oh my god this is so embarrassing. It’s the exact reason why young people aren’t gonna turn out for Biden b/c we’ve come to understand how hypocritical and stand-for-nothing Democrats are
[comment]I agree that there should be more focus on Trump's scandals too, he always gets away with whatever he is accusing other's of, but I am pretty horrified to see so many dems just throwing the #metoo movement in the garbage, just because it is currently politically inconvenient. Also, I have given Bill Maher too many second chances after saying some awful bigoted shit. I'm over his unfunny, racist show, but that's just me
[comment]Meanwhile during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings...
[comment]Glad that Bill said this, because no one else would have.
[comment]One case is one case too many. Why vote in a rapist when you have Bernie
[comment]“Believe all women until it’s not profitable” you guys are disgusting, how dare you
[comment]Why would we ignore these allegations?
[comment]I think we should vote on who Obama, the DNC ghouls, Gulf state oligarchs, health insurance billionaires, and pay day loan company CEOs should pick for our nominee.
[comment]I bet he wished he had been more critical of the Russiagate stuff considering the new findings about the lack of evidence for "Russian meddling."
[comment]President pussygrabber is so far ahead of Biden in accusations...they should be  concerned the media will start comparing their appetites for grabbing lady parts...Biden was better and vice president for eight years...it didn't seem to bother him then....non issue
[comment]Bill Maher is a boring libertarian. Pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Reporter asks Trump: "If a POTUS loses more Americans over six weeks than died in the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?"
[selftext]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siK0Xm0TqDY[comment]Well considering he did virtually nothing til mid March when Americans were already being infected the answer is no
[comment]Holy FUCK finally a reporter calls his incompetence out to his face.
[comment]An embarrassment to this country. Total idiot
[comment]I clapped when I heard this question. Wasn't there, but still well-deserved.
[comment]Just for perspective, there 58,316 American casualties in the Vietnam War. The number of US COVID deaths are now at 55,000.

Just 3,316 more to go before another "Trump Win."
[comment]yeah that 60-70 number is not happening now

why couldn't he just have lied and said 100 or 120 at least, the second wave kills as much as the first, but there's no way we keep it under 70 now
[comment]Whew
[comment]Grading on a trump scale this was a coherent answer
[comment]Wow. He essentially said: “at least I’m not responsible for 2.2 million deaths”
[comment]What ? Damn, I missed that due to the mute button problem....well done.
[comment]I mean listen I’m no trump supporter but what kind of question is that? I understand the incompetence of trump, especially in a dire situation where this country and the world needs a leader, but all the blame can’t be shifted on trump in all honesty. State governments are equally to blame, especially those anti-lockdown protesters. Trump shut down the country like any other country should, however the virus was well already spreading throughout the nation, state governors idk for what reason didn’t shut down their state borders, issues strict enforcement on mask wearing, curfews, etc...heck even in my state of Connecticut(one of the most infected states out there), people here still continue to go out to the stores without masks or gloves, there’s no strict curfew, law enforcement isn’t doing anything to enforce such regulation(not their fault considering they only have to follow orders and if no orders are given what else can they do?), etc... Again I’m not trump supporter and I certainly won’t be voting for him in the next election, but in regard to the outbreak of the virus, there wasn’t much else he could’ve done. He shut down the country when the number of infected were still very low, yet states at the time didn’t issue any type of strict enforcements to limit the spread (like closing off state borders), and now look at the situation wer in now. And now there’s even state governors like that in Texas who are calling to end the lockdown and these anti-lockdown protestors don’t even care whether they get the virus much less anyone else. I’m very much aware of Trump’s incompetence in general and his tone/speeches aren’t saving face either, but overall in reality there wasn’t much he else he could’ve done and I also blame state government for not doing much in the initial outbreak stages either to limit the spread.
[comment]Fun fact, "only" about 25,000 Americans died in battle in the 8 years of the revolutionary war.
[comment]Lame....
[comment]Jesus that’s a bold question.
[comment]It feels like he’s been coached since the shit show last week. 

Not that it helped.
[comment]40 countries have done more testing per capita than the US.
[comment]He takes no responsibility.
[comment]Nobody wants to talk about ventilators because 1) the situation evolves 2) tragically they are largely ineffective in improving outcomes

Hey as long as you’re a super genius why not invent a time machine and stop yourself from firing the pandemic task force.
[comment]Wait, was the original estimate of 2 million before or after it was one case, soon to go to zero?
[comment]This question is unfair. How would Trump know? He dodged Vietnam.
[comment]That reporter is awesome.
[comment]I mean, we can all agree he did not succeed in answering the question, but he handled it a lot better than I thought he would. Given his recent history with reporters asking the tough questions.
[comment]I'm actually genuinely surprised that he didn't resort to name-calling the reporter like he normally does...
[comment]What a shockingly dumb and arrogant question. You can certainly ask tough questions about this, but by that dumb and brute comparison no leader in the world should be re-elected.
[comment]Classic dodge the question
[comment]The greatest con artist of all time is getting better and better...
[comment]What a delusional fuck he is
[comment]The CDC issued its first warning on Jan 8. 

Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9, Jan 14, Jan 28, Jan 30, Feb 10, Feb 19, Feb 20, Feb 21 &amp; Feb 28. 

He golfed on Jan 18, Jan 19, Feb 1, Feb 15, Mar 7 &amp; Mar 8. 

The first time he admitted the coronavirus might be a problem was Mar 13.
[comment]I’m very surprised he didn’t call the person out for asking such a “nasty” question 🙄🙄
[comment]No!
[comment]I’m convinced he was wearing an earpiece &amp; getting correction anytime he veered off-course. If you watched the whole presser, he started to bullshit and do accordion hands and would suddenly stop. Same with this. I think someone told him to end after that question as it was going to go downhill.
[comment]WW1 had 53k combat deaths, 63k deaths of soldiers from disease.

675k died from the spanish flu.

Trump is not a good president nor does he seem like good person but the comparison between Vietnam combat deaths amd this pandemic is invalid.  It's not even apples and oranges comparison, it's a comparison between apples and plexiglass.
[comment]Even if Trump had tried to do anything, isn't he the guy who tweeted that the President is always responsible for everything that happens in his watch?
[comment]This outbreak is his personal Vietnam.
[comment]I think a lot of us owe her a beer, technically. I mean she was waaay more eloquent than I was imagining someone to be when they finally used his own words against him... but nonetheless that was a technical shit talk.
[comment]The COVID-19 deaths were not president Trump's fault. It's not his fault that there is a new, highly infectious, deadly disease going around, and the US fatality rate due to COVID-19 is actually lower than most countries. In the US, there are 320 million people yet only 56,521 COVID-19 deaths, while in Spain, Italy, and Germany combined, there are 190 million people and 56,624 COVID-19 deaths. Also, the average amount of deaths in the US in 6 weeks is a little under 325,000. The US leads the world in COVID-19 tests and in vaccine/treatment research; the US has also created many innovative methods for the safety of doctors such as machines to clean masks so that they can be reused. Also, this entire pandemic was China's fault because if they had not lied and covered it up and acted upon COVID-19 just 3 weeks sooner than they did, even though they new about for 2 months prior, they would have been able to prevent 95% of all of the COVID-19 cases and prevent the pandemic all together. The Chinese government and WHO also lied about saying that COVID-19 was not spread by human to human contact even though Taiwan said otherwise and had facts to back it up in mid January. Trump 2020.
[comment]I mean... is that really fair? This virus was going to hit no matter what and, by all accounts, we have mitigated the disaster by social distancing. Since the real power to handle this crisis is in the states hands,  I think a much fairer evaluation of the president's job in all this is to look at federal actions supporting the states and what the president has set in expectations and what he has actually done. I think we can all agree that he is fucked at this point from any rational evaluation of this.

But considering we are still below that very optimistic estimates of deaths, I'd say the nation is doing as well as it could have at this point in so far as government and populace reactions to the crisis. Except libertarians. Fuck libertarians.
[comment]The great [Olivia Nuzzi](https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi), currently at New York Magazine, is the reporter asking the question.
[comment]I'm actually shocked that he didn't just yell at her for being "an awful reporter, fake news, deep state," and so on.  

This was one of the most coherent answers he's ever given, and it was still complete shit.
[comment]I'm not even American and feeling angry, that such a crook could get elected.
[comment]yeah but, no but, yeah but, no but..
[comment]How can he argue they are doing well through this when countries who acted properly have far less fatalities per capita?
[comment]Trump claimed STD's were His Vietnam.  His boys are among the least intelligent humans on earth and they have immense influence. Our military claims something but they don't remember.  Where did six trillion go...
Thank you for your service white supremacy.
[comment]No, this piece of shit needs to be voted out and LOCK HIM UP for his CORRUPTION and being a traitor for RUSSIA!!!
[comment]He didn't answer the question and he congratulated himself.
[comment]Such a liar
[comment]well he didn't answer the question and all he did was congratulate himself, but I expected something along the lines of "such a nasty question. you are fake news. NEXT!!!" so it was a pleasant surprise nevertheless.
[comment]No one said 2.2 million people would die.  He is using the old word salad to lessen the blow, and people always fucking fall for it!   

"Hey mom and dad, I need to tell you something... I have brain cancer.  JUST KIDDING! I'm pregnant!".
[comment]If he had done what they did in California we would have 1/3 the cases and 1/5 the deaths.

And he knew and could have acted long before leadership in California did.
[comment]Absolutely not!  Vote Blue!
[comment]&gt;"So, yea, we've lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million. We're probably heading to sixty thousand, seventy thousand." 

That's not going to age well.
[comment]He's actively increasing the number of deaths. It's like him co-operating with the virus itself (or competing with it)...
[comment]"I think... I think... I think..." What you think doesn't fucking matter. Face the facts!
[comment]Humm was the 40k Americans allowed to return from China put into quarantine or
We’re they just allowed in so they could spread the virus ?
[comment]The problem is that he answers with such an avalanche of complete lies, about the border, about ventilators, about testing, that the only possible response is “that’s a lie” — but where do you get in? He’s already said 10 lies and somebody calls him on the last one? Somebody needs to yell out, in the middle of his response, “that’s complete bullshit!”
[comment]Trump should never have allowed anyone to return to the country from anywhere when this thing hit. We wouldn't be where we are at right now, if he was a better leader. The Democrats, however, did no better at the beginning and instead politicized a crisis as much as Trump.
[comment]Oh man, trump didn't answer the question?!?! No. Way.
[comment]All the points about Trump's overall awfulness are true. He's a dangerous monster. That said, the logical argument implied by the question - that the President in office should not be re-elected if more people die from a single cause during his term than died during the Vietnam War - doesn't make sense. If it did, then every President who failed to take a stand against the sale of cigarettes, alcohol, or failed to make flu vaccines mandatory is equally culpable and unworthy of re-election. Oh, but who wants to live in a Nanny state? The CDC reports "Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure. " And yet cigarettes are sold at every corner store and grocery store in the country. There is no difference morally in claiming a "freedom"'exemption to justify those deaths than in the people who want to go to work or get a haircut.
[comment]And all the while Trump defenders will still eat up his shit.
[comment]He never answered her question...
[comment]The fact that he was elected in the first place still boggles the mind. I really did not think there were *that* many stupid Americans.
[comment]It's a truly, fundamentally, monumentally stupid "gotchya" question and plays right into Trump's mentality. It's almost like she's just another "plant" (like that one recently...), but in this case planted by Trump himself to do a "bad gotchya question". I'm sickened by this kind of approach. It only feeds Trump's fervor, precisely because even in his dim intelligence he can discern that it is a very, very badly formed question. That's exactly the kind of question that won't work. It is, one could even say, the very reason we have Trump in power in the first place. If Trump enrages me, this reporter's question makes me throw up in my mouth.

Whether x number of people die has nothing to do with any comparison to a high mortality event (such as a war); it has to do with the intrinsic nature of the death dealing event in conjunction with the competence of response. To put it in the general terms she uses about "a POTUS", meaning that any president will be a failure if they lose a lot of people, no matter the event, especially if the death count is more than a great and infamous war, regardless of why those people died, is a guaranteed way to take that little shot she has and throw it away. If the San Andreas fault went and killed a million people, would we say, "well any president in charge when the US lost a *million people* in one day is a failure if it is more than the number of Americans killed in WWII, clearly". This has to do with the nature of the mortal event. In a way, it's the same as saying "I'm shocked -- SHOCKED -- that X". Which doesn't say shit.

Now, if she were to have focused very specifically on the incompetence of February, the inability to do the math in a timely manner, to initiate strong containment measures, etc., she might have had a chance at putting a dent in his armor. But the way she asked this, she galvanized his armor.  Thanks but no thanks. We need to do better.
[comment]Lapping the world?  WTF is he even talking about?  The world which had respect for us now has nothing but pity and contempt.  

This guy sucks.
[comment]In the same six weeks, there are normally 320,000 deaths. Is Trump responsible for those too? The virus represents about a 15% increase in daily deaths, almost half of it in NYC metro.

The US ranks near the bottom of western countries in per capita infections and per capita deaths  Without NYC metro, the US would be last.

The reporter is either a total idiot or a Democrat operative hired to smear Trump with lurid nonsense..
[comment]I'm surprised that Trump can answer this in his normal voice and not being angry and call reporters 'fake news'. :D
[comment]As a person who despises this administration and Trump, I hate this reporter's question. Aid hasn't been delivered to native Americans nor Puerto Rico, and she uses her chance to ask an actual question to make a viral video. And this is exactly the kind of thing that reinforces Trump sycophant's perspective on the main stream media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Reminder: Russian trolls are active on reddit to create division between Biden and Bernie, like 2016.
[selftext]https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-detailed-2016[comment]I know some Bernie Bro’s who are not Russian Trolls but they are actively trying their best to destroy Biden. They’re doing the same thing they did four years ago where they are advocating writing Bernie on to their ballots.

They do more harm than the Russian trolls in my opinion.
[comment]I don’t know if it’s Russian trolls or Bernie Bros, but I get three to four PMs a week from strange users trying to demonize Biden.
[comment]Sandersforpresident has been extra toxic lately.
[comment]It's not just Russia btw. There are covert conservative funded propaganda campaigns as well.
[comment]jesus tapdancing christ on a pogo stick can we give this russia shit a rest

 [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/russia-sanders-campaign-taibbi-957377/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/russia-sanders-campaign-taibbi-957377/) 

&gt; Did the Russians actually do these things? Maybe. It’s not confirmed either way. The sourcing even today remains tied to the same people who’ve lied about a thousand other things, both in the course of this story and before, from WMDs to the missile gap. As we saw this week, when officials quietly began admitting their ideas about “what Russia wants” rested upon perhaps “[**overstated**](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/23/politics/intelligence-briefer-russian-interference-trump-sanders/index.html)” interpretations of intelligence, many of these narratives have been elaborate exercises in reading tea leaves. And they won’t let us see the tea leaves.   
&gt;  
&gt; The United States, whose spending on intelligence and the military alone nearly equals Russia’s GDP, could crush Russia for breakfast and take the rest of the day off for beer and volleyball. But officials have spent the past few years furiously constructing a popular vision of the Russian enemy far bigger than the actual country, which the likes of Rachel Maddow and Barack Obama not long ago were correctly calling a “[**gnat on the butt of an elephant**](https://twitter.com/maddowblog/status/449242948941934592?lang=en).”   
&gt;  
&gt; The logic of Russiagate is now beyond absurd. Vladimir Putin, somehow in perfect sync with American voting trends, seeks to elevate both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, apparently to compete against himself in the general election, in a desperate effort to suppress the terrifying political might of, say, Joe Biden. I doubt even Neera Tanden in the depths of a wine coma could believe this plot now   
&gt;  
&gt; That this is a dumb story is characteristic. The people pushing it don’t have any smart arguments left for remaining in power. Through decades of corporate giveaways, trickle-up economics, pointless wars, and authoritarianism, they’ve failed the entire population. They are the ones directly threatened by any hint that the population is awakening to its decades-long disenfranchisement.
[comment]Ummm...yea, Russian troll are not the problem.
[comment]The Bernie subreddits are really full of Russians right now.
[comment]I wouldn’t be surprised, and I also don’t know what would be worse - people taking the bait of Russian trolls or just becoming trolls themselves “organically.”
[comment]While this is clearly what we expected from the start, I feel like we have to be cognizant of what we do and don't consider to be Russian or conservative troll operations. It can be very obvious sometimes, and less obvious other times, but you have to take every comment and post with a modicum of sensibility. I've seen people be called Russian trolls or operatives for simply speaking out and being concerned about certain things. It should be okay to have a healthy discussion on some issues we have with candidates, but still be aware that there are many trolls out there feeding into it. Others in this post are claiming Bernie bros are worse than Russian trolls, and that kind of comparison is a concerning one. I want to support Biden, and I want to have Trump out of office, but if some criticism is dismissed as Russian trolling, or somehow considered worse, it's hard to feel welcome.
[comment]I would not be surprised if they are on reddit, but this article doesn't mention that. Is there another that does?

I remember seeing loads of imgur posts that were lying about what was in wikileaks dumps (e.g. attributing quotes by Ben Carson to Democrats) and thought in retrospect they could be Russian, but it's also possible they were done by hard-right or hard-left people.
[comment]Also the Chinese. Also the Republicans
[comment]reminder: joe biden's a shit candidate, and pretending people with valid concerns are russian bots is what the hillary people did in 2016
[comment]Perhaps it's also best to keep in mind that just because someone criticizes your candidate or their platform does not inherently mean it's some undercover conspiracy. It surely is happening, but it is too easily to claim with no basis or evidence that "blah blah blah is just trying to reelect trump because they don't like my candidate." 

Political discussion is seldom pretty, so to assume every attack against who or what you believe in to be a bad faith arguement is ignorant at best and trumpism-esque delusional at worst. Do your homework if you see something you don't like. If you blindly throw accusations along partisan lines and refuse to consider the humans who support what you oppose and why they say what they say, you may as well be a Russian bot because you are hurting democracy just as badly.
[comment]Yes, because everyone that that doesn't like Biden must be Russian.
[comment]I noticed it big time the last five days.  I informed the moderators of r/feminism they were being brigaded by trolls going after Biden with a common theme and they were so thankful for my input that they banned me.

Also, r/politics has been completely taken over by foreign trolls who egg on Bernie Sanders supporters with stories that are outright false about Biden.  The same exact shit as 2016.

I implore you if you are a Bernie supporter, tread carefully on who you believe and repost on social media.  Because 90% of the stuff I have seen on the far left subreddits the last five days has been textbook Russian or Russian-style shit prop from the outside.
[comment]This election won't be lost or won because of Russian trolls, and thinking that is another type of scapegoat from real criticisms of Biden or Bernie. 

You have to lean forward into this stuff, not sit back and scream 'Russian!' when up against uncomfortable information.
[comment]Biden and his record has done a fine job of convincing me never to vote for him. And I've voted Dem my entire 20-year voting history.

I bit my tongue and voted Hillary in 2016, but not this time. 

Biden is showing no leadership right now, while Bernie literally fought to save a couple million of low income Americans the other night.

It is clear who the next president should be, and I refuse to settle for less than Bernie.

So you can either lose with Biden or win with Bernie. It's your choice.
[comment]Itstead of just being the town crier let’s get some posts with what our counter measures are to be. Please.
[comment]What's really shitty about this is we have to have rely on the Mueller report for information about this. That was released a year ago and against the objections of the president. We should have the FBI releasing regular reports on these misinformation campaigns. We need a president who will take our national security seriously.
[comment]👋🇷🇺: WILL TR0LL F0R F00D
[comment]Biden kinda sucks though.
[comment]You know I just thought of one thing. If we have to go to vote by mail for the November election it might actually stop the Russians from hacking the voting machines and handing Trump another election. The counting machines likely won't have anything to do with the vulnerable electronic machines.
[comment]I'm a Virginian and i do not like anything about joe biden
[comment]I am not a troll, not a Russian, nor a bot. I have issues with Biden and my vote for him is not guaranteed. The division is real.
[comment]I dont see very many Biden fans.  So arguments that way are rare.
[comment]Look. I’ll vote for Biden if I have to buy I don’t want to.
[comment]Does everything have to be russia?  

My dad died because he could not afford healthcare.  One of the candidates said he would veto medicare for all if the democrats passed it.  People are allowed to have opinions on candidates if they want.  If there's paying jobs where all you have to do is troll reddit all day, please send me an application.  I need to pay rent and eat and as of this month I'm unemployed.
[comment]Of course, they are!! Fk Putin! Isn’t there a window with his name on it?
[comment]So I support Bernie and all I hear from you guys: Bernie Bros this and Bernie Bros that, Russian trolls etc..  its sickening and also weird how you just cant accept that someone you will need in general election can have a more progressive views that yours.  Not paid by Russia but just likes healthcare and education more than you I guess.  Be nice to Bernie supporters we will vote for you in the end.... unless your'e going to be bunch of asses of course
[comment]I’m pretty sure I’ve seen it happening already. Damn.
[comment]Bernie supporter here...nothing pisses me off more than how aggressive Biden supporters have been on this subreddit. Just when I think eh whatever i'll vote Biden I see this shit and the comments and think how much do you have to blame other countries to hide their same old status-quo agenda's? You want the Bernie voters to come you will need to get your heads out of Biden's ass and push him to compromise with progressives more. FACT.    

SideNote: Remember Bernie supporters are mostly 30 and younger we know the difference between fake news unlike Biden supporters...
[comment]You should repost this every day from now until the election to remind us.
[comment]That may well be. But with news about Biden sexually assaulting his staff person...if I have to choose between Trump and Biden I'll stay home. There may be people who are causing issues on purpose, but Biden is proving to be the main cause for me.
[comment]The real problem is that it makes you question authentic sentiment. 

There are plenty of people who like Bernie and don’t like Biden, and who are tired of the “well would you vote for the other guy?” question. (I’d love to hear Biden and his supporters answer the same)

But at the same time if I say something critical of Bernie (and yes, I do believe in constructive criticism, and calling out bullshit) then I get pounced on. The speed and ferocity of the negativeness can’t be organic.

I definitely think that some of the subs are at least partially moderated by the IRA. If Russia can penetrate the CIA, I’m sure they can get moderation on these subs.
[comment]Why care Trump crime family has destroyed our country and our military is backing it. Our military are Treasonous fucking assholes.  Think about that.
[comment]r/PresidentialRaceMemes was one of my favorite subs, but now it’s been taken over by toxic Bernie or Bust folks. There’s even a poll on the front page where people are encouraging voting Green/Third Party. The change was so rapid and so dramatic that I refuse to believe it’s not coordinated. I’m a progressive and a Bernie guy, so it’s been especially frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Until my dying day I will never understand why Hillary Clinton’s existence causes so many people’s brains to melt into pudding. It’s just baffling on every level and anytime anyone tries to explain why they hate her so much they sound like raving fucking lunatics.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/SJGrunewald/status/1203503669699678208?s=09[comment]There have been few, if any, politicians in the United States in modern history who have so consistently been the subject of such intensely negative media attention, commentary, and opinion editorial pieces... for as long as she has. She doesn’t get a pass for some of her Warhawk positions but yeah her negative name identification is the result of that sustained negative media attention for 30 years
[comment]Brain washing and propaganda about her for 20 plus years.
[comment]Agreed.
[comment]Fox news spent 30 years piling up lies and hate. 

It takes a special kind of person to listen to 30 year so that and not turn off. 

The kind of person that needs an enemy. The kind of person that needs to hate.
[comment]A highly successful GOP psyop started in 1990.
[comment]In 2016 I was all aboard the Bernie train. During the primaries I ingested all the anti-Hillary flak. A lot of it was petty stuff and of course there was the obvious BS like Benghazi and her emails, but after hearing so very much of this sort of shit I began to believe "well, I'm sure a lot of this is BS but *some* of it must be true." It soured me on her so badly that I thought I might vote for Rubio or Jeb over her if she got the nomination, despite the fact I've never voted R in my whole life.

Disclaimer: When it came down to her vs Trump I sprinted to my polling place to vote for her over him. I'm not a moron.
[comment]Clearly these people just needed a tiny push, after which it was all their own energy perpetuating it. You have to give credit to the people who understood how to get the ball rolling, they were very efficient and the machine they set in motion is still running itself. Very close to perpetual motion.
[comment]Misogyny. Contempt for women is a National past time.
[comment]Really though they voted for and continue to support Trump.
[comment]It started with her work on Watergate.  Then, decades of hate, lies, and utter bullshit.
[comment]Her support of Bill’s ‘tough on crime’ stance is just one of many examples that she was rightly criticised by the left for co-opting populist reputation policies. It’s hard to argue that she wasn’t just a shell without principles that would say or do whatever it took to get elected.
[comment]Hey, remember that "Here's how Bernie can still win!" dude that wrote dozens upon dozens of articles in 2016 about how Sanders is totally going to win the election (even though he wasn't even a candidate anymore at the time)?

He's a 2020 Trump supporter now and writes articles about how Sanders supporters should switch to Trump.

Imagine that.
[comment]I like her well enough as a human being. But her voice could sometimes be a bit unpleasant.
[comment]I remember back in the '16 cycle someone had a tweet simmering to the effect of "if you have an issue with voting for Hillary over Trump, call your mom right now and work that shit out." I'm convinced that's behind most of it.
[comment]She’s got a better kdr then me for one
[comment]I used to just chalk it to straight misogyny, but season 2 of Slow Burn helped explain how long the Clintons have endured smear. There were lots of voters letting inaccurate headlines and Leno jokes from 20 years ago cloud their judgments
[comment]Because Dems don't think for themselves, are feeble, and fold to the whims of Republican talking points.
[comment]Bernie will win. He doesnt have an expiration date. 

This country is a goddamn nightmare, you dont get to pretend like everything is fine anymore.
[comment]Maybe you should learn something from Hillary's complete inability to inspire change. 

Like if I'm being honest I think the democratic party really hates having complete power because that means they have to deliver to their voters while pretending to protect capital and the rich assholes who own the party. 

America NEVER had a labor party. We NEVER had a voice for working people. We have a half assed corporate monstrosity that sells us a dream and then hands it to the republicans every fucking 8 years. And yes that includes Obama.

I hate this whole system i want it completely burnt to the ground.
[comment]It all begins with the Nytimes and William Fucking Safire.
[comment]It's critical that we are able to understand, tap into, and counter the sentiments that led people to hate her. IMHO, it was that she made people feel stupid. Gore had some of the same problems
[comment]Social engineering by Russia.
[comment]If she turn back to her 90s self I’ll love her
[comment]Murdoch, ailes, and the gop
[comment]Before she was a major figure, she did lots of good work with and for disabled children. When she first came to national attention, she was authentic and genuine. 

Of course she was attacked by republicans for trying to have a real cause as first lady and not quite looking and acting like a “usual” first lady. She tried to get involved in congress passing Universal healthcare, what a bonkers idea... Shes smart and she learned fast how to play the game and did so all during Bill’s terms in office, molding herself into a generic pantsuit and quaffed fake politician. She parlayed that successful transformation into being elected a senator and eventually secretary of state. 

The problem is, as SoS she helped the Obama regime do plenty of heinous shit in Latin America, just like the US has been doing for a century and a half, and she’s unrepentant about it, and just last week with seemingly no sense of self reflection, said that bernie hurt her in the primary despite her having the whole party machine and some cable news media working on her behalf. She’s become another self absorbed, self serving politician and we’re obviously worse off overall not having her over trump, but there’s plenty of reason to despise the empty suit of a politician she’s become.
[comment]Sometimes a person is untrustworthy *and* there’s a right wing conspiracy to destroy her.
[comment]Have you read up on what happened in Libya? You should.
[comment]She is from the same town and went to the same school. I've asked the s as me question of people who have known her and it's mostly because a) fox news, b) she really is kind of an asshole. Very entitled apparently.
[comment]Buttery males!
[comment]Same reason why they have so much venom for Pelosi and AOC
[comment]I think it’s the fake blonde hair; makes her look dishonest.
[comment]I mean...everytime someone has dirt on the clintons they end up committing suicide with two bullets to the back of your head...it makes you wonder.
[comment]I felt like I decently liked Hillary since she’s a wonky, nerdy, worker bee. And I identified with that. 
But I’ve been disappointed in her behavior post 2016 election.
[comment]I mean I admit I don’t like her politics but I did support her over Donald and the level of hate it goes to for a lot of people is... something else.
[comment]Because the Clinton's are evil, greedy, globalists who use their illegitimate foundation to funnel wealth from tragedy into their own pockets, but they also use it to take advantage of displaced children (Haiti and probably Syria too). The people gushing in this comment section for a woman who is objectively evil...all the while talking about brainwashing/propaganda?...is the irony lost?
[comment]Australia had the same with its Democratic equivalent party, the Labor Party with their leader Bill Shorten. It becomes an MSM led sanction - you're allowed to hate the individual chosen. It is part of a mass response.
[comment]I don't hate her. I hate her neoliberal policies, and I hate the fact that the Democratic Party establishment decided she was going to be the nominee no matter what, even if it meant cheating.
[comment]I think a lot of Democrats (including myself) are a bit salty about the perceived wrong doing in the 2016 primaries re: Bernie. I think the Republicans simply drank the Fox kool-aid. In any case she'd be a better candidate that Trump by miles, and I'd still prefer her to Biden.
[comment]My biggest problem with Hillary running for president was that she is the spouse of a past president. I didn't like Bush jr for the same reason. We should be discouraging such type of relationships and a single family holding such a prominent office for multiple terms. I did vote for her over Trump but ideologically i hated myself for it.
[comment]I wouldn’t say that I hate Hillary, I don’t like her though, especially when in comparison with someone like Bernie. Where Hilary’s political ventures change with the tides, Bernie’s stance has been consistent. 
Hillary understands that the current feminist zeitgeist, and she’s capitalising on the movement for her own success. Her support of the movement is hollow. 
Hilary is not pro women. She has never been. 
In 1975, a twelve year old girl was raped, left with permanent physical abnormalities and comatose for 5 days. 
Hilary Clinton defended her rapist, despite knowing of his guilt. She bullied the victim, with defamatory claims in order to relieve her abuser.
Following this, Hilary laughed about the experience.
[comment]To act like there’s no reason to dislike her is dishonest. 

It is disproportional to Trump though. The right usually shouts Benghazi whenever asked for a reason to hate her, but it’s been investigated time after time and there was no wrong doing by her. 

Having said that, start with the Clinton foundation. It has channeled billions over the years via Saudi governments, super pacs, special interests, you name it. I’ve heard numbers like 10% of it is actual charity.
[comment]I’m a Dem, I really didn’t like her in 2016. I wasn’t gonna vote at all until my roommate told me Trump actually had a chance so I put my name down for Hillary.. pretty worthless anyways since I live in Washington and were always gonna go Blue no matter the candidate (let’s not get into the electoral system, which is also dumb, this isn’t a true democracy since popular vote doesn’t actually matter). Long story short, I didn’t like her. And for 2020 I got a bad feeling... these Dem noms are not great. Biden is old, showing signs of the stress already and were not even close, Warren.. just lmao I’m sorry she’s not gonna get it against Trump even if she does deserve it, Sanders I think is a bit too radical for many (although I would probably support his policies against all others). I think Bloomberg is the best choice but honestly I don’t like his odds against an incumbent like Trump. We need a new Barrack who gets the party excited but also doesn’t tip the scales in too radical of a direction like Bernie imo. Trump shouldn’t be this hard to defeat, but at this point I do not think we beat him in 2020 with these candidates.
[comment]Faux News
[comment]She encompasses everything that is wrong with this neoliberal ideology. She sees foreign policy as a chess board where everything is about countering Russia. Never on the side of anti-intervention or stopping regime change wars. Still blames her loss on Russian intervention instead of her not campaigning in the rust belt. Stole the election for Bernie 

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

She was the definition of an establishment candidate. And people are sick and tired of the status quo

This is the same shit as everyone freaking out because Kamala Harris dropped out. Blaming it on racism and sexism rather than her being a terrible candidate. She did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for financial crimes because he was a big democratic donor.

These people are just tools to power and only care about their donors, not their constituents
[comment]She did try to subvert the democratic process by conspiring with the DNC to screw over Bernie. She IS corrupt.
[comment]I like this response the most.

&gt;@oREGINAl49ers

&gt;Women who seek political power are a threat to patriarchy. White women who are aware of their privilege and can effectively articulate it are a threat to white supremacy. Hillary Clinton did both so some people were really upset, afraid, and angry.
[comment]I always assumed it started in Bill’s presidency. She tried to push through a number of things (like health care reform - damn her! /s) and refusing to stay in her lane.
[comment]Okay, I have a story that might help explain this.

(Disclaimer: I am a left-leaning independent voter, and I supported Bernie in 2016.)

I work in the hotel industry, and back in 2016 our hotel had the honor of housing all of the Secret Service details protecting each candidate. It made for an interesting shift each day, as these individual teams would rotate in and out all day and all night.

Most of these folks were all the same: suit and tie, firearm and sunglasses. Groups of around 5-6 leaving in unmarked SUVs (an appalling number of these folks would forget their guns at the breakfast table, and more than once I had to chase them out the door yelling that they forgot their gun.)

The guy in charge of all the teams, as it turns out, was an insomniac, so he would wander downstairs, and eventually he needed someone to talk to. That turned out to be me. This guy, who shall remain nameless, had previously worked for one of those three letter agencies, and had a number of fascinating stories that I won't repeat here. Anyway, I add this for context to explain the next part.

Each time these guys left, they would do so in multiple SUVs, and although they were for the most part dressed identically, they each were in distinctly different moods. Some seemed normal, but one group seemed particularly depressed/annoyed, and the other I noticed seemed like, idk, kind of resigned.

When I asked their boss/agent in charge about then, he looked blank for a moment, then just burst into laughter.

He explained that there were details everyone wanted. (One was Marco Rubio, because he apparently treated his SS agents like old friends. He'd take agents just getting off duty out for lunch sometimes, and he always took their advice seriously, which apparently was very important to them.)

But the two details that no one wanted? If you guessed Hillary and Trump, give yourself a prize.

He told me that at first quite a few were interested in Trump's detail; he made lavish promises on how he would treat them, etc. But that soured quickly, and he began making more and more ridiculous requests of them, such as demanding they wear cowboy dusters and cowboy hats, to send the message that Trump was a 'good ol' boy.'

But it was Clinton's detail that was considered punishment. Some of these guys had heard the horror stories of the Clinton era (their boss wouldn't tell me any of these stories,) and after just a few days at the hotel, it was common to overhear why they didn't want the job now. Hillary puts on a very specific face for the public, but behind the scenes she is a purely hateful person. She treats her detail like lowly servants, ignores their advice whenever possible, and 'curses worse than a sailor' at the slightest inconvenience. The head agent, who was in that three letter agency when Bill was running things, described her as the true power in the marriage, and he had never met anyone since more despicable.

In comparison, he told me, Trump was the job the agents preferred over hers, hands down.

(Just a note: At this early point of the 2016 caucuses, Bernie had not yet accepted a SS detail, but the head agent told me he had met him, and although he didn't agree with Sanders' political aims, he told me Bernie is exactly the guy you see in his commercials, forthright and kind.)

Anyway, I feel that the kind of person that treats the people sworn to die for you so terribly, would probably be doing the world a favor by leaving the limelight forever. Just my two cents.
[comment]Is this a Democrat sub or just a Hilary circle jerk?

Seems like she's the focus here... Let's move on.
[comment]She has a slight overbite.
[comment]She wanted to get in to a nuclear war with Russia over a no-fly zone she wanted in Aleppo, Syria. 

I don't know why anyone would want that.
[comment]One of the Ivy League universities did a study on this... I forget which one. It's misogyny, pure and simple. Everything else is justification. She had a very high approval rating as the Secretary of State (despite the Bengazi BS). Then when she ran for president, it plummeted. The study showed conservatives, who lean toward masculine authoritarianism, despise women attempting to obtain power. It had nothing to do with her personally. It's a sad unveiling of regressive conservatism in the US.
[comment]I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[comment]Plus she’s a murderer so there’s that, and saying no one wants a female President is bull shit. Women make up the majority of voters so how do you explain that? Easily with they are self hating women.
[comment]Republicans have been character assassinating her for some 20 years now.

They were terrified of the Bill Clinton presidency.   One of the most booming economies with wages going up, not just profits for corporations, with record low unemployment  all while cutting the deficit.  The 90s were a golden time in many ways.  

Bill couldn't run again, but they knew Hillary was a very smart girl that had the potential to continue his legacy.  They knew that early on she would eventually have political aspirations,  and smart, powerful women isn't exactly something that the Republican base likes to see.  So they character assassinated her for years and years.  It continues to this day.

They are doing the same with AOC right now.  She's  especially a great target for them because not only is she a woman who won't back down, but she's also Hispanic.  They talk more about AOC than just about any other Democrat these days (outside Pelosi).  They are preparing for when AOC eventually makes a move up the political ranks.

The biggest issue with what they did to Hillary isn't that they endlessly attacked her... it's that the Democratic base abandoned  her by starting to believe at least some of the various attacks they've done on her.
[comment]...and that’s why Donald Trump is president today. Right or wrong (or somewhere in between), it’s real. We can never forget what poor candidate selection cost us; she lost the most winnable election in American history via a combination of powerful unlikability, hubris, and rank mismanagement.

[comment]If Hillary doesn’t want the hate, she should lose gracefully and keep her fucking mouth shut about candidates running now. She has no clue how to run a proper presidential campaign. If she could give good campaign advice or be able to pinpoint Russian agents, she would’ve won the presidency. She’s a sore loser and sad. I don’t really buy into any of the idiotic Fox News conspiracies. I just look at her actual words and pathetic excuses for losing the rust belt. Bernie worked harder than her trying to convince disenfranchised working people that Hillary would have their backs, and obviously, that was not even enough for her to not smear his name and hint at him being a tool for Russians. Hillary is a sad old lady who helped create neoliberalism. Her time and theirs is over.
[comment]Here are two facts; one which Democrats can't accept, and one which Republicans can't accept. 

* Hillary was the target of the conservative brainwashing machine. They hate her because (knowing she was the next primary candidate for the presidency)  the Right spent years demonizing her in a never-ending faux news cycle of hate.
* Hillary would have made a mediocre president. She's too close to corporate money to actually have represented We The People.

An observation:  In a (perhaps sick) philosophical sense, Trump is better, because he forces us to face the damaging consequences of the brainwashing of Fox News/Conservative media, and social media. America now has a call to action that cannot be ignored.
[comment]It's been over 3 years. Time to get over it?
[comment]I don't hate her, but I think she's seriously overhyped.

What I do find deeply disturbing is that the right-wing machine that exists to paint her as the 'antichrist' has mostly succeeded in regards to people who already disliked her.
[comment]At least we know you won't get suicided from 'em
[comment]While I don't hate her (and voted for her), I do find her entitled, out of touch, and robotic.
[comment]It's worth noting that she's hated by the uber left *and* the uber right, but for different reasons. I mean Hell, you had shitbag progressives[voted for Trump in 2016](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds) because they hated HRC so badly.
[comment]Trump would have beaten any Democratic opponent, he was running of eight years of Obama, eight years of pent up national racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Megathread for tonight's Biden/Sanders Democratic Debate
[selftext]**We invite you to discuss tonight's Democratic Debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders beginning at 8:00 EST and 5:00 PST. Please be respectful and stick to the issues.**


--------------


**The debate will air exclusively on CNN, CNN en Español, CNN International, and Univision, and can be streamed live, without requiring a cable login, on [CNN’s homepage,](https://www.cnn.com/) on mobile devices via CNN’s apps, and on CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast, Android TV, and other set tops.**[comment]Biden just coughed directly into his hand as he answered the coronavirus question. This is off to a stellar start...
[comment]Biden and Bernie really need some sun--both look so pale!!     I hope they attack Trump instead of each other.      Bernie personally comes off as a better "debater" and makes fewer mistakes especially on healthcare.
[comment]Honestly, this is how ALL political debates should be conducted. Primarily 1 on 1 (or small groups) with NO audience. Too often candidates only go for "zingers" to get a crowd response and don't ever actually answer their questions or contribute to the discussion. Or they end up yelling over each other and the audience who cheer and jeer for every little thing that is said. This is really nice, just 1 on 1 discussion over policy.
[comment]Answer the question Bernie. What would you do **now.**
[comment]Biden is taking the “crisis” approach with saying everything in regards to COVID-19 would be free. Bernie is trying to get the point across that his plan for M4A would provide a better foundation or defense, if you will, for such an event.
[comment]Biden is steady like he’s ready to take the role.


All this smearing of his brain power is going to be blown away tonight.
[comment]Bernie keeps talking our healthcare system and how it should be changed in the future. That does not address the crisis. We need to address what to do today.
[comment]It's not Ebola, Bernie!
[comment]I'm finding Biden's behavior really awkward.
[comment]Did Biden just credit himself for stopping a great depression?
[comment]How do we feel about immigrants also getting healthcare?  I would normally say no but seems crucial in times like these
[comment]Bernie doing one of his rants instead of answering Joe's questions about how to pay for it.
[comment]Wait did Joe Biden just straight up lie twice??😬😬😬
[comment]“I still won!”
[comment]I expected this debate to be focused primarily on the coronavirus
[comment]Biden is getting hammered.
[comment]Imagine a Biden-Sanders ticket though.  If Biden were to offer and Bernie were to accept, sure supporters on both sides would be pissed on several fronts.  But once the dust settled, it would ultimately unify the party, end the primary (thus eliminating the threat of spreading coronavirus at the polls), and secure a landslide victory over Trump in November.  Imagine...
[comment]So Bernie has decided to just lie and take everything back to his stump speech, cool.

Leadership sometimes requires working with reality, Bernie. Sticking to your guns is cool for your brand, but doesn't do anything to mitigate damage being done.
[comment]I never thought I would say this, but Voden is making solid points and Bernie is acting like a bumbling idiot and a sore loser. The question about him supporting the winning candidate was an easy one and yet Bernie struggled to answer it!
[comment]Bernie out there blazin Joe up
[comment]Neither one of these clowns have a prayer in hell of beating Trump. with their policies your taxes will be through the roof and gas prices will be $4-5  a gallon.
[comment]Biden has answered every question in a numbered list format
[comment]So they asked Bernie why his message isn’t resonating with African Americans and he talks about turning out young and latino vote?

Given an opportunity to speak directly to us and this marg has NOTHING to say?
[comment]Every time Biden starts with "Number 1" I worry he's going to get lost on his rambling track to the next Number 1" story...
[comment]Where can I find a recorded version of it in Canada? I just happened to have missed it.
[comment]Biden did not try to bring progressives into the fold tonight. He lied about his past record and gave no solutions to what progressives care about. Bernie did not help himself either tonight. He needed to come at Biden way harder than he did. Biden gave one word answers, waited for Bernie to answer and then parroted what Bernie said. The whole Cuba, China bullshit was aggravating just for the fact that it shows that people refuse to think beyond a black and white mentality. It was just fuel for people who respond to dog whistling. 

One last thing. The whole "how will you deal with the Coronavirus?" question is pretty pointless when you CANT do anything now at this moment if you ARE NOT the current president. It was a pointless question and won't be a concern once either candidate gain the office.
[comment][interesting fact checks](https://www.wkyc.com/mobile/article/news/verify/verify-fact-checking-the-11th-democratic-debate/95-394b8c45-40ac-4f66-8c21-d83e3641b177)
[comment]Also very uncool of Biden to talk down on Italy, a nation hit SEVERELY by this pandemic. He used their crisis as a point to down play single payer health care . Think about that. He used actual deaths to LIE  for the sake of his campaign.

South Korea ALSO has a single payer health system. They, along with China’s current system, are being praised as models for how to contain the pandemic.
[comment]Biden is a lying sack of shit. 


Let him go the whole way and I’ll vote trump again.
[comment]1. Number one
2. Number one
3. First thing we got to do
4. Situation Room
5. Those 2 things
[comment]This more a thread about the moderators opinions than actually debating the debate.  Who is this guy?
[comment]Biden has allegedly lost thousands of voters after being caught put lying during debate.

https://youtu.be/nZ2WOT455MA
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter and I realize Biden is going to win.

But God damn is he doing a piss poor job of trying to pivot and unify the party no matter how you think he did at the debate.

Hillary didn't give a damn about trying to unify and it helped tank her.  Biden needs to stop bad mouthing M4A.  Say you don't think it could pass, or that you'd get there in a perfect world, but Everytime he's like "but it doesn't work, we can never do it!" It really makes me not like/ want to vote for him.  Saying he would veto it before the debate was such a terrible political move I was stunned.

This is going to be 2016 all over again till team Biden takes one of the like 10 olive branches Sanders was offering in that softball debate and actually works with the left to unify.  He can't just take it for granted like Clinton did.
[comment]Damn it's pretty crazy how many times Biden lied about easily provable facts about his record.  You guys think he's gonna do anything to reach out to Bernie's support base, or will be just try to win without young people like Hillary did?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]New standards eliminate Tulsi Gabbard from next Democratic debate
[selftext]https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486348-new-standards-eliminate-tulsi-gabbard-from-next-democratic-debate[comment]Good when can we eliminate her from the party?
[comment]She has no business on the debate stage.
[comment]So?
[comment]I admit I didn't read the article, but what polling thresholds and unique contributor numbers has she generated which would give her a place in further debates? As for delegates, she has 2 out of over 1,300 so far. 0.2% to 0.3% should qualify one for debates?
[comment]#DropOutTulsi
[comment]Good. She’s a total and complete disgrace and doesn’t deserve to be on stage.
[comment]You people are insane.  Tulsi v. Trump!?  People would CLEARLY SEE she would be the only presidential-like-adult on stage.
[comment]Didn’t Bernie tweet that she should be allowed to debate? 🤔
[comment]&gt;It’s probably better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in. 

\-- LBJ

On why, whoever wins the nomination, should invite Tulsi to join their team.

"What position do you want? Uh, okay. Secretary of State is probably off the table, but something else maybe?"

Politics is always about strategy. Get your enemies on your side--leaving them on the field is a mistake. Trump offered many of his previous rivals a spot in his cabinet (Carson, Perry), or worked with them on state issues (Scott Walker), and it helped solidify the GOP behind him 100%.
[comment]Nobody with her numbers needs to be on that stage, but I’m a little concerned as to why the standards are always changing. Why not set the rules at the onset so all the campaigns know what to expect?
[comment]Where were those rules for Mike Bloomberg?
[comment]THANK GOODNESS
[comment]would bang
[comment]Why hasn't she dropped out yet? Every candidate that has preformed better than her has already dropped out.
[comment]Democratic Party: "Rules are rules, guys..Let the process work as is intended."

Also Democratic Party: "Let's go ahead and change the rules."
[comment]Is Tulsi Gabbard still running for President? If she is, has anyone told her?
[comment]Thank god. She's an ugly person on the inside. She's not needed in the party.
[comment]No body gives a rats ass what she has to say anyways.
[comment]Why is she even still running? I guess you get to keep those donations and you dont actually have to go to work. I wonder how many votes shes missed at this point?
[comment]Wow...there are a lot of Bernie Bros in here.  Oh wait...none of you are Bernie supporters?  

Why are you all acting like sexist, misogynistic conspiracy theorists, then?
[comment]She’s nuts
[comment]Any standard should eliminate that Russian stooge from the debate stage. This shouldn't be anything surprising. She's been polling dead last for a while now. Time to take your ill gotten gains and your Kremlin backed ass out of there Tulsi.
[comment]Raising the blinds
[comment]How will she whore for Russia if she can’t get on TV?
[comment]Tulsi Gabbard eliminates Tulsi Gabbard🪕🪕🪕
[comment]Only Billionaires can buy into these duh
[comment]Girl, bye.
[comment]What is her secret agenda I wonder.
[comment]She won't be present to...I dunno, stand there and be present.
[comment]"Please let me in the debate so I can attack you!"
[comment]Good.
[comment]People have already said it well here, but I feel that you can’t earn a spot on the debate stage just by refusing to drop out of a race you have clearly lost.
[comment]good
[comment]She’s a Russian asset anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Republicans are worried Trump will deliver Biden a landslide victory
[selftext]https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/us-election-2020-trump-joe-biden-economy-policies-republicans-democrats-a9537786.html[comment]Republicans need to be decimated as a political party.
[comment]They had three and a half years to do something about him.  They didn't.  Instead, they fully transformed into the party of really stupid traitorous greedy racist democracy haters.
[comment]If only they had a chance to remove him....
[comment]Wouldn't it be funny if Hillary just ran against him again?

She’d only need one campaign slogan:

“Are you better off today than you were four years ago?”
[comment]As long as people VOTE he will!
[comment]That's what the GOP thought during the 2016 election as well after the pussygrab video came out. But the deplorables just stuck with Trump's scam. I fear the bar has been lowered way down into hell this time around.
[comment]“If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it.” - Lindsey Graham
[comment]They should have thought of that in February when they covered for him.
[comment]Well they're certainly not acting like it.
[comment]Biden doesn’t have a chance
[comment]What I cant understand is this hill they are dying on.  They could right now, impeach Trump and convict him.  They can say, "We gave him every chance, but he never learned."  They can claim he was never a "true conservative," and then nominate some young, not racist guy that might look and sound better than Biden.  They could all stand there and say they "put country first" and people would buy it.  I think there are enough swing voters that would vote for a guy like that, or a Niki Haley type...Can you imagine those mother fuckers get a woman in first? Biden is not good in debate, he is not good on the campaign trail. He looks amazing because Trump is such a fucking idiot, but up against a suave, smart, attractive Republican (male or female) it would be hard.  So why are they willing to end it all right now for Trump?   



Because they're going to cheat.
[comment]Ah yes, pre-gloating.  A tactic that always returns victory, just ask Hillary Clinton and Al Gore.
[comment]Let just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange füher from office. Common America it’s time 🇺🇸
[comment]I mostly see posts that republicans are worried about an impending Biden landslide on democrat subs. This news while uplifting can unconsciously demotivate us to vote because ‘it’s in the bag’ so to speak.   I don’t know why we believe anything republicans say and truly, anything that could demotivate democrat voters to vote would surely be in their election playbook. 

OP no disrespect, we want to hear good news, but I felt so extremely whipped in 2016 that this similar message now coming from the republicans, that they are ‘worried’, is beginning to seem disingenuous on their part. Maybe it’s conspiracy theory, but they have a solid history of spreading propaganda. 

Downvote me to hades, if you must.
[comment]Landslide? Joe is damaging his campaign every time he opens his mouth. How is he going to debate when Freudian slips keep happening when cameras are on him?
[comment]Trump cultists haven’t budged. They love Trump even more now that he’s killed people with his lies and misinformation. They think he’s a hero and they’re “warriors” saving the economy from democRATs. Vote. Vote. For the love of God vote!
[comment]As a moderate, I try to see each issue on its merit rather than “My team says...” However- I believe that the current GOP needs to pay a serious political price for enabling this dangerous buffoon. A heavy, heavy toll that they will hopefully never forget. I have voted Republican before, but I don’t think I can ever do that again. Where did our honor go? Our values? Sure Obama and Bush made mistakes (Bush more than many) but they were good men, who tried to do what they thought was right.
[comment]Huh funny, I was just thinking the opposite
[comment]Just Vote.
[comment]Good.
[comment]tRump 😆 is killing himself because he's sooo stupid 😂
[comment]They should just forfeit the whole fucking thing and save everyone the time and money.
[comment]Biden looks boss af in that pic. That’s a commander in Chief!
[comment]Niggers
[comment]They can always send another candidate if they want.
[comment]The "good" news here is the ignorant orange asshole is incapable of changing his strategy. He is convinced he is infallible so it has to be right.
[comment]If we had more democracy and everyone voted all that would happen is the GOP would have to adopt some more popular positions. The horror!
[comment]All Biden hast to do is not interrupt Trump while he’s beating himself
[comment]It needs to be a landslide loss to make it harder for Trump to cheat and steal.
[comment]How about just saying F politics
[comment]Well....well they should be. Mabe it will help them with that self-reflection stuff. I hope anyway.
[comment]They had their chance to get rid of him.
[comment]Can’t believe it’s another shit show of choices....Guess I have to vote for the hair smelling rapist over the racist murderer smh
[comment]Doesn't matter what anyone says or thinks. VOTE. VOTE like your VOTE will be the deciding VOTE. And don't only VOTE in major elections. VOTE in all your local elections too. Your county website should have all the info. If you can't find it, ask your local library for help.
[comment]As rosy as the situation is now, it will be a lot worse by Election Day. The death toll will be 300,000+ and tens of millions will have gone months without any income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]10% of Trump 2016 voters might not vote for him in 2020 — The persuadable Trump voter could swing the election in November.
[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21173431/swing-voters-trump-2020[comment]I refuse to believe this until I see it.

Remember when 25% of Republicans were expected to stay home in 2016 because they thought Trump was so disgusting? Their embarrassment to publicly admit they want to vote for Trump doesn't make their vote for Trump disappear.
[comment]Encouraging but I’m not gonna count on it
[comment]After reading through the numbers it is estimated that 5-9% of Bernie supporters voted for Trump. Some of those will again.
[comment]I'm one of those switchers.

I did a lot of maturing between 2016 and 2020.
[comment]££
[comment]Given the age demographics of Republicans I would be surprised if 10% of Trump 2016 voters haven't died.
[comment]I would hope we could swing the election without them and they only matter in 3 states as we won the popular vote by over 3 million. The popular vote does not matter in our broken constitution with the electoral college compromise.
[comment]I never met a wishy-washy republican.
[comment]This presidential election is all about bringing out the base. The level of polarization the US electorate makes it unlikely to change anyone's mind about which team they support. Whoever does a better job bringing out their people to vote wins.
[comment]Great let's do m4a
[comment]We can only hope they find their way back.
[comment]50 percent of clintons voters may discover Joe to be more off-putting. So how will that balance out?
[comment]Well, I know at least one. My father's friend says that he regrets his vote and isnt dong it in 2020 VA.

But whoever wins the primary I am campaigning for.
[comment]Oh great! We are counting on a bunch of spoiled selfish conspiracy theorists to win the day. What could possibly go wrong?
[comment]Former Trump voter here, definitely not voting for this idiot in 2020, probably voting Bernie.

First, in my defense I grew up in a religion that made great efforts to isolate its followers from politics and while I did vote Obama twice I was just as ignorant then as I was in 2016(ignorant as in didn’t know shit about civics/politics/history/etc). It wasn’t until early 2018 that I seriously began educating myself, I did so specifically because the extreme emotional reaction I was having regarding politics made me uncomfortable(I know a lot about how cults operate having been in one and my reaction was textbook cult).

Anyway, I’ve been reading a lot of philosophy and found my views are far more liberal than even I realized, I was just too scared to have my own opinions before now as I was more concerned with slotting into a pre-made ideology(which is actually a result of the religious conditioning I was subjected to as a child). Once I developed this new found self confidence I started actively challenging my own views in a way I never had before and realized what I knew deep down the whole time: Trump is essentially a cult leader and I had fallen into another cult where it was unacceptable to challenge doctrine. This is my personal opinion however, so take it with a grain of salt.
[comment]He has a 92% approval rate among the voters and this Party is shitting on Sanders supporters.
[comment]I made a mistake in 2016 and voted for trump, but after all the slime ball shit  the past 3 1/2 years and with this mishandling of the pandemic, he lost a vote with me.
[comment]They may catch windmill cancer too if they aren’t careful.
[comment]Surprised its only 10%.
[comment]Could this be true?
[comment]What the article doesn't discuss is where these potential vote flippers are located.   If they tend to be in blue states anyway, it may not matter.
[comment]Seems like wishful thinking. My question is how many Democrats (especially young people) are gonna be put off by a candidate who is anti abortion, strongly opposed to expanding government healthcare, pro war and anti gay marriage? I mean at least Obama campaigned on changing things and fixing America's problems. Biden is campaigning on keeping things exactly the same. I mean he supported segregationists!! I think Trump wins vs. Biden, and to be honest seeing how bernie is doing I think Trump wins vs Bernie. Older Americans are afraid of Bernie. They got 30 years of anti communist propaganda and can't understand that bernie wants to enact programs like Canada, the UK, and Sweden, not like the USSR.

America just isn't ready.
[comment]Biden is gonna get destroyed in those coming debates. Do we believe that Biden will travel the country doing rally’s? It’s gonna be ugly, Drumpt is going to play nice like we’ve seen in these primaries. Drumpt is gonna attack Biden relentlessly, it’s gonna be ugly. Biden isn’t the same guy anymore, hasn’t been for a few years now.
[comment]I was willing to vote for pretty much anyone but Biden. The Democratic Party is on the verge of selecting the one candidate I would vote for Trump over. So count me out of that "10%".
[comment]Good. I don't want more Trump.
[comment]They would have voted for Bernie. They resented Obama’s turn against his 08 progressive politics. They got suckerd by trumps false populism. They won’t vote for an Obama era guy that suckerd them once already.
[comment]The victory lies with the swing/independent voters. Been saying it for two years. Motivate your friends to register and vote at Vote.gov
[comment]Don’t forget Putin.. he wants the puppet.. he’ll cheat for the win.
[comment]Trump is going to win again because our party just has no fucking clue how to unify.

Go on r/SandersForPresident \-- you'll find a huge number of people who will never vote for a democrat if Sanders loses.  

Republicans, they know what they're doing. Every single one of them is voting for trump.

Us, we're splittling votes between write ins, and 3rd party candidates. We don't know how to be pragmatic. Its pretty depressing.
[comment]Trump voters want an anti-establishment candidate. That candidate may be Trump and it may be Sanders, but it sure as hell ain’t Biden
[comment]that sounds about right. in the end, even 10% of the jim jones cultists refused to drink the koolaid (but had the needles forced into their arms)
[comment]If sanders doesnt make it im staying home, fuck it. Dems abandoned their base a long time ago.
[comment]So we need to go with a candidate that will pull those voters then.
[comment]Only 10%. People are so willfully ignorant.
[comment]That's okay, the disaffected Berniebros will vote for him again like they did in 2016 because they didn't get their way.
[comment]&gt; "... The persuadable Trump voter ..."

* you mean any Jethro with a double digit IQ?

No doubt even his most idiot Russian shill bot backers are getting tired of shooting themselves in the foot and voting against their own interest.

And I don't want to hear shit about those morons wanting to "get sucked up to heaven", or whatever bullshit they're talking about, because voting GOP is cutting your own throat, and you might want to consider by what you've been doing, you ain't eligible for the draft, if you get my meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Michelle Obama Is Mad at Black Voters, Not Trump Voters — Twice [in the "Becoming" documentary], she talks about how painful it is to her that black voters didn’t turn out to vote for Hillary Clinton, calling the decision not to vote more painful to her than those who voted for Trump.
[selftext]https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflixs-becoming-shows-michelle-obama-is-mad-at-black-voters-not-trump-voters[comment]She is awesome. I wish she would be our veep because she would make a fantastic president.
[comment]I'm mad at everyone who didn't vote for Hillary in 2016 too, but still pretends to be progressive. Great for those who are apologizing for that mistake and going to vote for Biden now, I guess though, but that doesn't bring back the countless thousands who have died as a direct result.
[comment]Uhgg.  Couldn't agree more.  Not only in 2016 but especially 2010.  First black president and black voters couldn't even be bothered to show up in 2010 and let the Tea Party take over.    The Dem party shoots itself in the foot a lot.
[comment]Imagine being a political party where you get angry at a certain race for voting a certain way or not living their lives how you decided they should live their lives. Almost sounds like this party is “Using” black people. What a shame.
[comment]What the hell is this shit? For one, black people don’t have to vote Democrat. For another, black people don’t have to vote for Hillary. And furthermore, black people don’t have to vote if they don’t like the candidates. But worst of all, [59.6% of black people turned out to vote in 2016.](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/12/setting-the-record-straight-on-black-voter-turnout/) In 2012, 66.6% turned out and that was their highest turnout of all time. Black people voted in their strongest numbers ever for Obama and of course they did, he’s an inspiration. But Hillary wasn’t Obama. I don’t like this criticism. I don’t think it represents the facts well and I don’t think it represents black people well. I don’t like it.
[comment]Call me crazy but I think people should WANT to vote for you, not be forced to vote for you.
[comment]You should blame the candidate not the voters. If you can’t get people to vote for you, it’s your own fault (and also republican governors for voter suppression).
[comment]I feel the point she was making was more around, 'why DIDN'T you vote at all? those who voted for Trump at least voted, and spoke up about what they want to see in the country." Not voting just hurts the movement that she has been a part of building.
[comment]Let’s be real. Black people dont vote. Even if Kanye was running for president they won’t go out of their way to vote. I’m Asian and even I know Asian people won’t vote if it’s Andrew Yang
[comment]It is the citizen's responsibility to exercise their franchise. If you don't vote, you can't complain about what you get. With the number of people that didn't vote in the last election, you could have easily put a third party candidate in the White House or written in Bernie Sanders. Instead we have an incompetent, petulant, man-baby with his dick in one hand and his phone in the other.
[comment]Maybe if they nominated a candidate people actually wanted to vote for this wouldn't be a problem
[comment]44% of eligible voters didn't vote in 2016. Thats about average for every presidential election, Obama's second term was the highest turn out ever at 68%.
[comment]Michelle assumed an entire segment of society that shares the burden of (sometimes) hidden discrimination would understand that only a Democrat would protect Obama's legacy.  Trump made it very clear he was anti-Obama and would destroy any legacy left over. John Boehner and Mitch McConnell had made every piece of legislation Obama tried to pass an absolute ordeal. Michele is nothing if not loyal and she saw what her husband went through.  Maybe she assumed everyone would see as clearly.
[comment]Mad because Black voters either A didn’t want to vote for Hillary or B, voted for Someone other than Hillary. Imagine being mad at people for thinking for themselves. Pathetic
[comment]Trump voters have serious mental issues and don’t know any better.
[comment]2016 was tied for 2nd-highest turnout in the last 50 years. Tied with 2004, trails only 2008.
[comment]Or Democrats could try nominating someone who’s not had 30 years of baggage and right wing vitriol thrown at them, warping peoples opinion of them? Like her husband... 

But no, lets go with the lady everyone right of crazy hated and the guy who’s brain is melting. Good job, fellow primary voters!
[comment]She knows she never had sway with those people.
[comment]You can’t make voters turn out for an uncharismatic candidate.

We’re about to find out this same thing we already knew in this election. The only way Joe Biden will win is if Trump somehow makes a fool out of himself to his own supporters, but their standards have never been lower. Democrats have high standards but mediocre candidates, and that’s what always ends up costing us in turnout. We have to somehow beat the republican herd mentality.
[comment]All these people blaming others for the losses. Look to yourself! Did you phone bank? Did the Democrats do enough to reach out to would be voters? The fault is with you not those uninspired to vote for a candidate that failed to create enthusiasm.
[comment]Its about people NOT voting. Not people who voted  for so n so.
[comment]Because she knows how evil the Clinton's were to black people and that's why they didn't vote for her. Michelle Obama is Privileged AF and needs to wake up to this. She should've endorsed Bernie.
[comment]Even her enemies admit that Hillary is a great administrator. And it's time we all admit that Hillary's predictions have been right on the money. None of these problems would be happening if Hillary was President. And the Obama economy would still be chugging along and 70,000 Americans would still be alive.

Of course, we would still have problems. The Republicans would be on the 27th investigation of Benghazi and Fox would be demanding that the body of Vince Foster be exhumed.
[comment]Thank 👏 You 👏 Michelle 👏

I've seen the numbers and the amount of black voters that did not vote is exactly why Trump won.
[comment]NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. 

Hillary’s campaign was warned numerous times that something bad was happening in the rust belt and they ignored it every time. If they had pushed for turnout in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin they would have won. Wisconsin had implemented voter ID (suppressing turnout vs. 2012) so GOTV was even more vital than usual.

[comment]It's a right to vote Michelle there are choices
[comment]Why TF are dems still perplexed as to why people didn't come out to vote for the worst democratic candidate of most voters' lifetimes? Of course nobody came out to vote for Hillary, she was a terrible candidate.  I'm frankly surprised she got as much of the vote as she did.
[comment]I have said this multiple times and pissed off many friends: However dumb you think Trump voters are, someone who did not vote is automatically dumber.

For me it is just in super simple math terms. Whether you voted Trump or Clinton, that choice shows you are capable of comparing two numbers  and deciding which one is bigger. This is a very basic skill. 

Not voting is the equivalent of saying “I cannot tell you if -10 is greater than -1000, they are both negative so I refuse to compare them”
[comment]Being betrayed by a friend is much worse than being betrayed by an enemy.
[comment]You want politicians to listen to you and pander to you?  Vote!  Doesn’t matter if you don’t like either of them this time. 

First of all stop voting for the charismatic guy. Vote for the smartest guy. Stop voting for “slick” Good on TV assholes.  You don’t have to work with him, he/she just has to make the best decisions on your behalf.

But back to my main point. The next election, if politicians see that 90% of young voters turned out...guess who they are coming around to pander to?  90% of black voters turned out?  Guess who they are coming to see and listen to?  IT.  DOES. MATTER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Joe Biden: "I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag, swastikas, and other symbols of hate that have been used in these protests have no place in America.

[comment]Trump shirked responsibility again, he didn’t want to upset his cult, instead threw the governors under the bus because he wants to be liked, goddamn he’s a fucking child, a true leader with leadership skills would have backed the governors not incite the protesters.
[comment]Not to mention Nazi flags 卐 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
[comment]Leadership.
[comment]Too bad they're all forms of speech and therefore protected under the first amendment to the Constitution.   

Not that Dems care about that old piece of paper once they're offended or scared...
[comment]Lol. Joe Biden didn't say that. His side maybe wrote that. There is no way that guy could formulate a coherent thought such as this good try. I would like to even see Joe Biden read that on camera without fuxking it up.
[comment]Regardless of ones feelings. I myself care not for the Confederate Flag or Swastikas. However, my indifference is that regardless of how one feels, there’s Freedom of Speech in our nation. When you take away first amendment rights, you are open to taking other rights away from the people.
[comment]Fuck Trump and his eighth grade drop out followers.
[comment]It's "funny" how these kind of protests always involve confederate flags and nazi symbols no matter what the purported aim of the protest is.
[comment]Wish his spoken sentences were as coherent
[comment]Sigh. Yeah this dude is way better than the Devil himself
[comment]I think it's funny that one of my favorite genres of music is southern rock, yet I agree with this.
[comment]Will he also say that all Americans should have access to free healthcare?

Probably not.

Why get the whole sandwich when you can get the crumbs?
[comment]Biden is actually racist though. Why wouldn't the democrat party want to get rid of him instead of letting him infect the party and ruin public perception of the party?
[comment]I love it, don’t vote for 1 scumbag but vote for the other scumbag. Gotta love it
[comment]About time he got a voice-SPEAK UP FOR JOE

[comment]I'm a simple man. I see biden, I downvote.
[comment]Yeah I’m glad he said this and all but.... is this really the bar we’ve set now?
[comment]He didn't "say" this he tweeted it.
[comment]Just a heads up, the pic of the guy with a swastika/nazi flag was someone mocking Trump/Pence during a Bernie rally *years* ago.  Reddit figured it out a few hours after the images were posted but i just wanted to mention in case someone missed it.

I only mention it because of the Republicans victim-card-spidy-senses get all tingly when you bring up swastikas. Its a perfect opportunity for them to do what they do, avoid the overall point about these protests.
[comment]Let's start a task force, that goes around, finds people that have thse flags flying, and bulldoze their houses!
[comment]Does anyone actually believe Biden said that?

[comment]Swastikas were around way before Hitler used them. And in the USA too. I’m Native American, and we (the Osage) used the swastika as a symbol for various positive things.. “well-being” is one such example and I believe there is another we used specifically but I don’t remember. It just got stolen by Hitler, unfortunately.
[comment]Anything to direct attention from his raping ways.
[comment]Don't forget that Democrats were the KKK after the Civil War or has that fact conveniently been ignored.

Lets put the same legal action on any station that puts his lies on the air.
[comment]OMG! This is so cute! This thing has already gone viral on social media. LOL

[comment]All the caterwauling about the 2nd amendment, and these faux defenders of the constitution can't even tell you what the 1st amendment is. If they only put coherent Trump statements he stood behind into an advertisement, it would be shorter than his pudgy little fingers.
[comment]But he did.
[comment]\#thetrumpvirus
[comment]When you don't have a leg to stand on, but you try to teeter your ass to an upright position...
[comment]Discovery. Simple. Trump is using legal action as a form of intimidation. It’s the Devin Nunes playbook.
[comment]So, they want to sue because the ad tells the truth. 🤔 Good luck with that.
[comment]I love how he just calls everything that even remotely threatens his position of power a “hoax”.
[comment]Priorities USA should counter with “we’ll cover all your legal fees if you are sued by the Trump campaign”.
[comment]SLAPP suits 101, and he’ll sue in West Virginia where they don’t require a prima facia case.
[comment]Hey Trump lemme just pull out the world's smallest violin real quick.
[comment]..... he did though
[comment]Please find the audio of him actually saying the virus itself is a hoax.  There is your answer to this headline.
[comment]I swear if they cave under this bullshit threat then they're part of the damn problem. *Everyone* gives in to him. Everyone backs down. 

Paste this link all over the damn internet folks.

https://youtu.be/G5TZ6fTYrsE

And let's be clear here. Fact-checkers, in my opinion, are *also* caving. They say it's not fair to say Trump called it a hoax. This is the full quote that they say clears that up:

&gt;“Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it.  We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ ‘Oh, nothing, nothing.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. ... And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that’s been pretty amazing.”

You tell me. *What* exactly is he calling a hoax? The claim he's not doing anything? Because the rest of the ad has all the quotes you need proving *that* interpretation too.

This is bullshit and we have got to stop taking it. If fact-checkers and journalists aren't going to, then we damn well better.
[comment]But he did, though.
[comment]How the hell can reality be unfair to Donald j drumpf or any like-minded person when he/they think the alternate reality that they believe in is actual reality.
[comment]Let em sue then use that against them too
[comment]Sure thing, right after Fox News goes off forever. 

BTW trump is famous for his past bullshit threats of legal action.
[comment]It's plainly established precedent. In the US truth is an absolute defense to libel or slander.

Let him file the suit and lose, or more likely have the judge take one look at it and throw it out. In the meantime the very charade will just further sink any chance he has of winning.
[comment]So what? Let em let him sue. Roll the tape!
[comment]This is one of those times where you should’ve been more open minded and diplomatic Don. I think those excepts fall under fair use. Not much can be done to stop it from happening.
[comment]Yeah but he did! Like it's crazy that they deny he says stuff that is on video with those words coming out of his mouth. I've heard this before. Yeah he said the "corona virus, just another democratic hoax" but yeah you see when he says that hes not calling the virus a hoax hes calling the democrats a hoax! Really, come on! I've heard this from my Republican family members.
[comment]“This is their new hoax.”

[comment]How dare they broadcast factual information! Damn liberal media.
[comment]Trump was tweeting some of the meanest crap against Obama when he was fighting a pandemic just for attention and his agenda. If you can't stand the heat, get outta the kitchen.
[comment]God he is stupid!
[comment]What is this word, alleging? Let’s replace with stating.
[comment]The networks need too have some courage for once and keep running the ad. They would have no chance in court with this, the discovery period would be truly enlightening and damaging to him with every deceptive advert he's ever run (practically all off them) and his constant slander of others brought up and nationally reported. How can these people accuse slander when he slanders everyone everyday? It's the boy who cried wolf. The advert is accurate and people need to see it.
[comment]Calling Michael Bloomberg - he could nullify this scare tactic in a second by pledging protection for entities threatented by the dictator's campaign.
[comment]HAHAHHAHAHAH
[comment]But those words left his mouth, and the sound and lightwaves within his vicinity were captured on a recording device, and then that media was publicly posted...but I can see why he would say that, half of his die-hard supporters probably think google is part of the deep state and look up their info on lycos search
[comment]Last election, Trump suggested Ted Cruz' father had something to do with JFK's assassination. But now he's being treated unfairly. I've never heard a rich dude use the word "unfair" so often.
[comment]He did, its on video. Clear proof. Let him sue. He'll loose. Then counter sue for damages, and he'll loose again. Call the bluff.
[comment]The caption to this post uses the term "alleging". WTF? There is no alleging. It's on video.
[comment]Sooo...let him sue?  because he doesn't have a case??  

This is the authoritarian answer yo everything here in the US.  Sue and bankrupt everyone that farts in the wrong direction.  Devin Nunez pulled that shit too.

Let them bankrupt themselves.
[comment]That will be an amazingly easy lawsuit for the TV stations and add creator to win considering he's on tape several times calling it a hoax and a democratic hoax!
[comment]It’s just a tactic to either get it taken down or neuter it by turning it into a “he said, she said.”  Sometimes I can’t tell if concerns noted in these threads are made in good faith or fake.
[comment]What is the basis for the legal action?
[comment]Every anti trump ad should just play his lies along with a graphic or video of the actual truth. Every word out of his stinking face hole is a lie so there should be mountains of material to work with.
[comment]But he did say that. It's not defamation if it's the truth. He said it. We have him on video saying it.
[comment]Alleging?

He actually did.
[comment]Does anyone have a link to the ad?
[comment]&gt; However, fact-checkers at The Washington Post, Snopes, Politifact and FactCheck.org have said it’s wrong to claim that Trump called the virus a hoax.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, Trump’s full quote reveals that he was describing Democratic efforts to politicize the virus.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;“Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it,” Trump said in February. “We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ ‘Oh, nothing, nothing.’ They have no clue. They don’t have any clue. ... And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that’s been pretty amazing.”

&amp;#x200B;

They could edit the ad and take the hoax part out.  It is still damaging without it given all the other crap he said about it being under control.
[comment]He actually ranted that democrats were criticizing the response and that criticism was purely political and a hoax.  The criticism was dead on!

We should run with this, because it makes the Democratic opposition look intelligent and even prescient and makes him look like a bigger idiot for his botched response!

I'd love to see somebody do an ad or video that shows Dem politicians saying what he should have been doing or was he did wrong and then show his rant over the increasing number of cases.

&gt;**Now  the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right?  Coronavirus. They’re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You  say, ‘How’s President Trump doing?’ They go, ‘Oh, not good, not good.’  They have no clue. They don’t have any clue.** They can’t even  count their votes in Iowa, they can’t even count. No they can’t. They  can’t count their votes. One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr.  President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn’t  work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment  hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they  tried it over and over, they’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all  turning, they lost, it’s all turning. **Think  of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know, we did  something that’s been pretty amazing. We’re 15 people \[cases of  coronavirus infection\] in this massive country. And because of the fact  that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than  that.**

<|startoftext|>[title]Biden Now Leads With Most Senior Demographics — Older Americans' Support for Trump Has Collapsed — "Let Grandma Die" Proves Unpopular With Grandma
[selftext]https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/[comment]65-75 are considered the most reliable age group to vote. And the most susceptible age group to life-ending coronavirus.

We need to start pushing vote-by-mail as our national standard during a global pandemic. Just in case that second wave hits about that time.
[comment]Boomers only care when it impacts them
[comment]Biden is more popular than Hillary Clinton. I hope it’s enough to make a difference.
[comment]Ya, lets see how this works out when grandma needs to create a facebook account and log on to the internet to vote.
[comment]Except my grandma... and aunts and parents. I can't make them see the reality of the situation that has been entirely trump's fault.
[comment]ive never voted for a republican and ive lived a long time
[comment]Don't worry. They'll find something for Grandma to be scared of more than them, and they will drive that fear all the way to election time.
[comment]Love it. If grannies mad at the orange turd, it's over.
[comment]Maybe it’s because Biden seems older so he’s more relatable
[comment]Let’s hope it’s enough. It’s only our entire democracy that’s on the line after all
[comment]And us the youth who will have to live with this new world after this blows over in a couple YEARS wanted Bernie the one time that the youth the least reliable age group came out in force Biden shows the fuck up and splits the fucking vote. If he loses it’s fucking over.
[comment]Republicans have always gotten 0% support with this grandpa.
[comment]I'm not sure why but polls don't pick up on the voting preferences of certain lower income republicans. We should ignore all these polls.
[comment]I would like to hear more stories about people who voted for Trump, but changed their minds. I seen a video about people who voted for Trump in 2016 because they thought he was going to help them. Well looking at things now, and how things were happening, they changed their minds.
[comment]I think Joe Biden feels like a safe option for a lot of seniors.  These people have lived through a lot, they know nonsense when they here it.
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.
[comment]Let Grandma Die Proves Unpopular with Grandma 
🤣🤣🤣
[comment]"What a twist!"

Also, saw a quote from an unnamed investment banker on the reopening of the economy. Sounded like Moriarty from Sherlock. The gist of it was,
"People die, that's what people do. People need to start taking responsibility for their lives."
[comment]I don’t see any references to a let grandma die message?
[comment]Pray it is so!!
[comment]If this holds on the election day it will be a bloodbath. I have concerns so everyone vote.
[comment]It's funny now, how conservatives try to spin "death panels" would happen under Obamacare and here we are in 2020 where conservative led "death panels" are choosing who lives and dies from COVID 19.
[comment]So glad to be going back to trying to appeal to the demographic that votes hand over fist for every corporate stooge that pops up. /S
[comment]Well we’re screwed then because I live ( minutes from Iowa, and they already opened everything back up. People from Illinois are going over there to shop and eat. Then bring back the germs to Illinois
[comment]Trump's gambit was that most of the casualties would be in the cities and that they would die in time for election day. We have to be careful and actively prevent that from paying off for him.
[comment]This feels so off, I hate both candidates but I’ve never heard someone who was a Biden supporter
[comment]I'll believe it when I see it. Old people have spent the last 40 years believing literally every conspiracy theory that has ever been thought of no matter how inane. All it'll take is one email blast about how Biden is working with the U.N. to put Christians into reeducation camps or some shit. Then grandma will go running back to the GOP.

We must stop whining and outvote the old. Tweets aren't votes. Posts on Reddit aren't votes.
[comment]The question to me isn't how he is polling in different demographics, is how there is one single American out there that still supports him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Bernie Sanders endorses Joe Biden for president
[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/bernie-sanders-endorses-joe-biden-for-president.html[comment]Why is there no post on this sub about the allegations against Joe Biden? It's been picked up by the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/d922da60baa91121f4529fe51a0fd55a) now, it feels like something we should be able to discuss as Democrats.
[comment]Vice President Sanders... I know I know it won’t happen but... /sigh
[comment]*always blue!*

*always blue!*
[comment]United we stand. Let's do this people.
[comment]Let's go boys!  I wish he was VP but it'll never happen
[comment]Blue till I die, but it’s going to be a hard battle.
[comment]FLIP THE SENATE
[comment]Now let's get out there and beat Trump. Time to take the country back.
[comment]Let's move forward United.
[comment]To my fellow Sanders supporters,

You can't kill an idea. He may have dropped out, but his ideas and goals live on. Bernie has shifted the party and even Biden is adopting some of his policies. Short term goal is to beat trump. Long term: Make America Better for everyone. Equality. Education. Medicare for all. We can do this. United.
[comment]As a Sanders supporter I'm still bitter, but I know the ultimate goal.
[comment]Im voting for the guy, but I’m bitter as hell that Biden is running to the right of Hillary.
[comment]Meh, who cares. The real power to make change is in the senate anyways
[comment]I'm sure it was tough one for Bernie. I guess anything is better than Anoying Orange we have as president now. Maybe.
[comment]:/
[comment]RBG will NOT survive another 4 years. Bernie supporters need to chin up and realize that we’re not just fighting for the presidency, we’re fighting for the Supreme Court, so stop with the “never voting for Biden” crap. If Trump wins and gets to nominate another judge, we are going to get screwed for the next 20-30 years.
[comment]Glad to see Democrats coming together after a hard fought primary. We may have disagreed on certain issues, but going into the general election we can all be glad to see the most progressive platform for any Democratic nominee in history.
[comment]I'd vote for one of Biden's turds over Trump
[comment]Everybody still needs to vote for Sanders to maximize his delegate count and power to influence the Democratic party and turn it into something that people can actually get excited to vote for.
[comment]What would you like?  4 years of potential mediocrity with Biden or 4 MORE years of the circus we have right now?  We need to band together folks, even if our favorite candidate didnt get the nomination...
[comment]Ok Biden supporters,  take all that energy of guilting sanders supporters into voting for Biden and instead get your asses out to canvass. If he loses, there will be no one to blame but yourselves.
[comment]Sanders should be vice president. Just for the simple fact that he has so many behind him.
[comment]Sigh
[comment]Not me, us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Mask and all, Biden crushes Trump
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/opinions/biden-mask-trump-ghitis/index.html[comment]At this point, just duck Trump.
[comment]The stars aligned for Biden. He is an awful speaker and now all he has to do is put a mask on and let Trump tweet to look presidential.

Trump is going to go out spectacularly, I guarantee we will look back on May 2020 Trump and go, "wow that guy was pretty sane!"
[comment]Okay, but still vote. Like, Biden only crushes Trump where it counts if EVERYONE VOTES. So VOTE.
[comment]Don't buy into this narrative. Consider that Trump and his supporters are the exact kind of people who would deliberately LIE to the pollsters just to see false information spread out there.
[comment]The only power we have is to withhold our vote until he takes serious action on climate crisis and Medicare for All.
[comment]You're right! we shouldn't ask for anything from politicians five months before an election!
[comment]No. Organizing and asking for reasonable, popular policies like Medicare for All (wanted by 70%+ of Dems) , and in a world where 35 million people lost their employer based healthcare in the past ten weeks... And you're telling me to vote for a mouse? What the fuck is wrong with you?
[comment]Great. Two disgusting old rich white men. 

Again.
[comment]Sorry Biden is going to lose without the left this time unless he moves on Medicare for All and Climate Crisis. All my leftist friends are going to sit this out.
[comment]Trump and his cult can spew whatever bullshit they can but between the RayBans and the black mask Biden looks presidential.
[comment]I'm voting a straight Blue ticket and for any candidate that runs against Trump. 

Not voting in this critical election is not a protest, it's a vote for Trump and his enablers.
[comment]Currently masks are worn ONLY to stop the spread of Covid-19 not preventing the wearer from getting the virus. I understand both perspectives on this, but if Trump wore a mask the only reason would be to provide a figurehead to encourage the public to wear them. As a president he doesn’t in order to appear more confident on the world stage. Biden doesn’t need that confidence until he’s president (also he isn’t tested as often as Trump).
[comment]Not just vote. vote for every Democratic candidate you can in every election everywhere. Anyone in the party that supports trump is morally bankrupt.
[comment]Ninja ~~Gaiden~~ Biden
[comment]Lets run up the score and humiliate Trump. We need to vote in numbers never seen before.  Destroy Trump's brand.
[comment]One of these two guys walks into a liquor store to rob the place. Which one do you take seriously (from the picture above)?
[comment][totally ](https://imgur.com/gallery/qWB8155)
[comment]LOL. Masks are the ultimate political statement in 2020: http://mask.vote
[comment]Bahaha a CNN article
[comment]tRump's killing his chances for a second term all on his own, why you ask... because he's stupid 😂
[comment]I would vote for a potato if it was blue
[comment]He looks like a supervillain with the mask on.

*And I'm not complaining, it looks awesome.*
[comment]Trump sucks, but you guys might isolate the far-left who voted for sanders. There is the sentiment that Biden was the worst candidate to chose, and so they might vote green. In order to entice this group of voters, Biden would need to adopt some basic sanders policies like M4A, and forgiving student loan debt. He really needs to go further left. Some of them even thought warren wasn’t radical enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Moderate Democrats have a duty to consider Sanders. He has a clear path to beating Trump.
[selftext]https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/09/bernie-sanders-could-beat-donald-trump-2020-column/4694526002/[comment]It is a two-way street.
[comment]Bernie is consistent and has a lifetime of supporting the empowerment of others. But probably just as important is that he has bold, aggressive, enthusiastic supporters who are more than able to fight back against the lies of the religious Reich. If Bernie is the nominated Democrat you will see an ocean of noise, color and movement rising to counter the barking dogs, thumping bibles and lie spewing rhetoric that every fundamentalist/baptist/pentecostal church in America will be spreading like the Coronavirus to gullible, naive people. Bernie supporters are aggressively armed with facts, and fueled by the aggression of knowing that peace, love and hope kisses won't defeat a hitler wannabee. I am all for unity within party. In fact, I am a Warren supporter and have raised thousands of dollars for her this year. But last time (when I was dumb enough to support Stein) it was local Clinton supporters who were antagonizing the Bernie supporters.  And we see that Hillary just can't keep her bitter, forked tongue mouth shut. So, it feels hypocritical to call for unity when Bernie has suffered sabotage, and a media blackout. The aggressive Bernie supporters are simply raising the volume to not be covered up by the corruption. The stakes are high in this election. This is Bernie's last chance. I understand their passion. And I support it.

Edited because...sugar.
[comment]Yea, if he wins the nomination sure. For now i’ll support a candidate who can win and won’t be a leftist trump
[comment]I promise if Bernie wins the primary, he will have my vote in the general. I am also not yet decided on who I am voting for in the primary, but it’s likely not Bernie. It’s definitely not Biden however (in the primary that is). General election Democrat gets my vote. Blue no matter who.
[comment]I live in a very red state. I always vote for Democrats. If Bernie is the nominee, I will have a very hard time voting for him, becuase he is not a Democrat either, and has spent most of his lifetime hating Democrats. JFK made him sick? He wanted someone to primary Obama? My vote won't matter in the overall totals in my state, so I wish I could leave it blank, but I will vote for him on a Tuesday and work to primary him on Wednesday.
[comment]I'm on team Pete but ultimately will vote blue whoever gets the nomination.
[comment]And Bernie's base has a duty to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
[comment]This is what can turn people away from voting Democrat . Basically says that you should only vote for someone because they have a high chance of beating that other guy not because they agree with him.
[comment]I would vote for Bernie if he gets the nom but I think this article is bunk. The real danger here is that Bernie getting the nom would likely send Wall Street into a frenzy. They have already been trying to stave off an overdue recession, having Trump running around telling everyone their 401k's are about to go up in flames would only set people off. Do you really think the boomers are going to do the right thing and vote with their conscience when their retirement is on the line?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Yale professor warns time running out for Americans to stop Trump dictatorship.
[selftext]https://www.businessinsider.com/authoritarianism-experts-say-time-running-out-americans-to-stop-trump-2020-2[comment]I fear we missed that window.
[comment]When he suspends/ignores the elections this year, it's going to be too late.
[comment]I seem to remember other people worrying about the same thing with Mr. Obama. He'll serve another term, and live in retirement (but probably still be in the news, occasionally).
[comment]Guys, come on. As someone that leans conservative, I can assure you that the vast majority of my conservative friends and people I know would not stand for a dictator regardless of political affiliation. It goes against our core beliefs in upholding the constitution. If trump tried to suspend elections, we would be shoulder to shoulder with everyone to remove him from office.
[comment]once the masses are living paycheck to paycheck they don't have time to participate or protest as much.
[comment]So he’s going with the Libya model? How does that one end again?
[comment]Time to dust off that 2nd amendment and take a stand against tyranny. 

Sadly, I fear there are many who would use those same words to defend a despot.
[comment]Probably no coincidence this was released the same day it was exposed that Yale and Harvard have been hiding foreign money.
[comment]I started r/TheNonsilentMajority after reading this. 

I think there's a space for anyone who has an issue with the escalation of power in the Executive Branch, or the abetting and indulgence happening within the majority of the Republican Party of Washington. I know there's the Political Revolution subreddit, but I think there needs to be a neutral space less affiliated with progressive candidates (despite common goals) to allow anyone who doesn't want egregious breaches of our democratic values to be further normalized. Voting is a huge piece. Donating, Volunteering too. But we have to declare, with our voice, and our presence, that we will not give the players in this game a blind pass.
[comment]I really don’t think it will be close at all. Dems might even win Georgia and Arizona maybe Texas too
[comment]Sometimes I wonder if we'll ever truly be able to come back from this.
[comment]In all my life, I have never feared for our country's future like a do now!!
[comment]Except it's literally not a dictatorship.
[comment]Exactly
[comment]Marsha Blackburn and other “R” friends are currently blocking bills from being passed that tighten election security.
It’s obviously working out for them.
[comment]Minus a few details but chillingly close, I read an article about two years ago that laid out exactly how this day and worse was coming.  I believe the author was a young American professor of Indian (Asia) decent.  For the life of me, I can’t find it again. At the time, I had posted it here, but it was promptly removed because it was a freelance journalist portal not whitelisted and I’ve since deleted my old account.  At any rate, what I want to say is, the writing was on the wall from the beginning. Many people saw and understood it. Unfortunately, his base didn’t, still don’t, and probably never will until it’s too late. They all suffer from severe tunnel vision and can’t see the impropriety in their beloved leader because they are too busy chasing the proverbial carrot he's dangling.  When it’s all over and done with and they find themselves completely alienated, I will be the first to say, we fucking told you so- now move out of the way.
[comment]That Yale professor clearly does NOT understand what a dictatorship is.   Under a dictatorship like  Kim Jong-un's, only one way of thinking is allowed.  Anybody who disagrees with the ruler ends up dead or in prison.   If Antifa (the best example of fascism in the modern world) were to rule the US somehow, they would morph from fascism to true dictatorship getting as ugly as it can possibly get.

Whether you love or hate Donald Trump, he is not a dictator, nor does he want to be one.
[comment]Perhaps the professor forgot about the Women in pussy hats, BLM, ANTIFA, the Women's march, March for Our Lives, etc.  Marching will not work, because it's been done and has not worked.
[comment]Occupy Washington
[comment]I'm going to be 72 in a few months, demonstrated against the war in Viet Nam when I was young and have demonstrated against Trump and his administration several times.  In all of the recent demonstrations I have observed a lack of young adults, specifically Millennials, and have wondered what the fuck they are thinking!  The Yale professor is right:  It is way past the time to take to the streets . . . so get out there if you haven't already made plans to do so.  We Boomers will be dead soon, and the country will be yours, so grab onto it now before assholes like Trump take it away from you.  My rant.

PS.  Bernie alone is not going to save you.  You have to work for it.
[comment]When he won the election I thought well this is going to be batshit crazy times. It’s 10x worse.
[comment]Wow that hand is in the foreground
[comment]First things we’re doing in the Trump Regime 2.0 is drilling for oil in Yellowstone and nuking mexico to get rid of the cartels.  Buckle up and get ready to get fucked. 🍆
[comment]I love how this photo appears to make his head gigantic and his hand tiny.

[comment]No one...No one on Earth has faced the decades long gauntlet of ridicule and partisan  investigations that Hillary has.   


While the Republicans wasted multi-million of taxpayer dollars on whipping-post investigations to churn out their voters and snag independents, they nevertheless  VETTED Hillary as the ideal candidate...because they found nothing indictable. Please note how the Republicans quietly, oh so quietly, released their investigation findings so their voters would never read the truth. In all of congressional  investigations and in all the endless hours of Fox News malicious speculation, there was nothing indictable. She survived decades of Republican bullshit. That's fucking badass.  What you see here is Viking-level badassery:  to survive a 30+ year long 24/7 tornado of media/investigative malfeasance and yet people still fuckin care more whether she's wearing make up than the point she's making:   WEAR A FUCKING MASK and VOTE.

[selftext]https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/opinion/trump-senate-acquittal-impeachment.html[comment]Craven cowards. Disgusting.
[comment]The dumbasses do realize that by removing him from office he may also be arrested and no longer a threat right?
[comment]Fear *and* greed. Not necessarily in that order.
[comment]Trump has probably spent his morning planning on revenge on Romney.
[comment]So the Republican strategy is that they think it looks better to be in fear of the president than to be a sycophantic bootlicker. Well, I have news for them whether they're one or the other both look pretty effing bad.
[comment]Typical of tyrannical regimes. Hitler's sycophantic hangers-on were afraid to wake him up to let him know the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy. Same for Stalin when the Nazis had crossed their Western border on the road to Moscow.

The end is near.
[comment]Simply put:

I hope it haunts them for the rest of their lives if he starts doing things that can no longer be excused. Things that actually keep them up at night. Arguably he already is, but it hasn't been enough to bother them (yet.)

People dying. Different parts of the government collapsing. The United States itself falling into disrepair. That's all on them.

They knew exactly what sort of shit Trump would immediately do if they let him off the hook for this, so EVERY BIT OF SUFFERING that comes after is THEIR fault.
[comment]I look forward to seeing the reactions when he turns on his party.
[comment]They all have partaken of russian money
[comment]makes no sense. If they convicted and removed him, he would no longer be a danger. There is more to the story we are not hearing (i.e. funding from the RNC).
[comment]Makes what Romney did all the more impressive.
[comment]That's why republicns do everything: they are afraid of everything all the time
[comment]bunch of cowards
[comment]The word to describe that is coward.
[comment]And?
[comment]Just like an abused partner.
[comment]Chicken sh*ts. All of ‘Em.
[comment]Cowards and Crooks
[comment]I don't think it is Trump, per se.  Though he is a complete asshole, really he himself is limited.  Rather, if you oppose Trump, you oppose his vocal, and let's face it, fucking looney bin supporters.  Your office will be deluged with hate mail, all sorts of threats made, family members intimidated, and probably a few real and legit threats will come to fruition.  Also, the big money supporters will walk away.  For Romney, he doesn't care.  For some farmboy like Cory Gardner?  Not only will you loose reelection, but you will not get a job afterwards.  So these Senators are looking at loosing their current gig, and then no opportunities later.
[comment]Well no shit! If he goes down, they all go down. If he gets imprisoned, they all get imprisoned. Mob Rules
[comment]Yellow-belly cowards...
[comment]I understand democrats are angry, but this article is just pretending to know people's inner thoughts.
[comment]Their districts are so gerrymandered, Trump can hold them prisoner. But only if they are cowards.
[comment]Fear of what tho?! You cowards WERE the check and balance. You stepped aside and now we all are afraid since he has no check. 

You could have done what’s right and the risk to you already rich people was losing re-election. You woulda been fine monetarily too.
[comment]Cowards! We're led by cowards.
[comment]No they didn’t, they did it for the money. If they would have impeached him, he would have been removed from office , then the fbi, state dept, and CIA, would have resumed all pending investigations and put his ass in jail or have him die in an accident.
[comment]Marco Rubio literally said Trumps actions meet the bar for impeachment and then says he he won’t impeach because this is partisan. Not voting what you believe is what is making it partisan.
[comment]Spineless cowards who piss on the constitution because they are afraid of his voters.
[comment]Of what? His tiny baby hands?
[comment]Shit ton of money helps with that.
[comment]That just really shows what cowards they are.  And makes Romney seem even more brave by comparison
[comment]Cowards, isn’t the GOP the party of tough guys, or so they tell everyone
[comment]Fucking cowards.
[comment]Most of dictatorship have started with the abdication of Legislative chambers.
[comment]Republicans have no spine, and are cowards.
[comment]Fear of what!!?? He only has the power they give him! If they showed him they were in charge they could make him their pussy instead of the other way around!
[comment]The GOP are a bunch of little wimps, except Romney.

Romney is an extremely respectable Republican.
[comment]Even Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, caved. What is he afraid of?
[comment]Fear of what Russians meddling in the elections and ruining the country?
[comment]They're not afraid of Trump. They're afraid of Putin, the puppeteer.
[comment]Lol
[comment]They're not scared. They're psychopaths.
[comment]The senate vote should have been anonymous.


No retaliation danger.
[comment]The fear that stokes so many people is death more than losing one's job and that's why so many of these warhawks in the Republican party like Trump and Cheney had multiple deferments,and now would gladly send other people's children to die. That's just plain cowardly but now they're even below the standard of cowardice. They fear the idea of losing their jobs over the loss of a fragile democracy. It should validate to anyone with half a brain that their true core worship is money and nothing else. Money over morals, ethics, integrity and love of country. The Democrats should remind people every day of what these people stand for; make their worst fear a reality in November.
[comment]I’m tired of hearing all this “behind closed doors repubs know drumpt is wrong” ...repubs don’t care, let’s stop making excuses for their coward behavior!
[comment]Walk away from the Democratic party!!  I did and couldn't be happier.  This type of irresponsible ranting is just rediculous.  Wake up and think, read, and read counter arguments!
[comment]I’ve never seen stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep take so long to finish someone, especially one as deserving as Mad King Donald.
[comment]I understand the anger, but this is an opinion piece-- not an article. Moreover, the piece does not cite any Republican (on or off the record).
[comment]That's because they are gutless. I repeat, gutless.  Let me say that one more time, GUTLESS.  Moral decadence has never made a quantum leap downward quite like this one.
[comment]They’re afraid of the wrong thing.
[comment]You know guys, this is an objective assessment - don’t get angry - please: 

the House rushed impeachment. They needed to build up the evidence for PR purposes. If you compare how Nixon was removed with how this House moved forward... it’s like night and day... in 1974 the House voted 410-4 to begin an impeachment inquiry. That’s not a typo: 410-4!!!!    

US District Court, and the Court of Appeals and then the US Supreme Court ordered Nixon to produce the tapes... several of Nixon’s aides were tried and found guilty... his AG and deputy AG resigned... Republican Senators went to the White House and told him to quit... I mean the sky was falling... 

That’s what it takes to remove a President and I think we rushed it in case. I just hope it does not backfire.
[comment]What if Trump actually literally goes mad?  He seems sometimes to be on the verge.  And now he's enraged after the impeachment and the Rush Limbaugh scandal, etc.
[comment]They’ll be too afraid to do anything when Trump decides he’s going to make himself president for life. Seriously people, we better have a plan for when this guy decides he’s not going to give up power.
[comment]Fake news
[comment]So proud that Sherrod Brown is my senator.
[comment]I emailed both of my fucking senators and told them exactly what I thought of them. I called them out for cowards and told them I was appalled that they sold out the American people, and basically said they are dead to me. I hope those emails ruin both of their fucking days.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Yes. It turns out the Trump fired the CDC expert on China as well as the pandemic response team.
[comment]This wouldn’t have happened if Bernie Sanders had been nominated, AND we would have had the healthcare and financial infrastructure already in place to handle a pandemic.

Go figure!
[comment]Any other functional adult would have handled this better
[comment]Hillary did win, by 3,000,000 votes. Putin weaponized congenital idiocy to exploit a flaw in our election process.
[comment]Besides general incompetence and leadership failures on trumps part this country would be ducked regardless maybe to a slightly lesser degree with anyone else in charge.  No sick leave, no national healthcare with 30 million uninsured, and a complete disregard for the poor would have ducked us regardless of who is in charge.
[comment]Maybe we could talk about people who are currently involved in the democratic party and our politics? like i get it, it sucked. We were all there. 

What we need right now is the party to start asking themselves why we're not hearing anything out of Biden right now. Sanders is out there raising money and organizing and Joe is "working 4-5 hrs a day" and "reading memos" 

I'd really like to hear a lot more from him right now, especially considering that he is supposed to be the front runner
[comment]oh hell no this wouldn't have happened if she won but if it did happen it would be nothing like this because she's not a stupid mother fucker, whether you like Hillary Clinton or dislike her you can't say she is not one of the smartest political women in US history. Whether you like or dislike Donald j drumpf you definitely can't say he's one of the smartest politicians in history he's actually one of if not the dumbest people I've ever seen but not just in politics this guy is just plain stupid.
[comment]It would have happened. Maybe the response would be different. But the virus would have happened either way. 

It's delusional to believe the virus wouldn't have happened or it would have acted different. The virus doesn't care who the American president is. It's busy infecting the other 6.7 billion people in the world not American.
[comment]The markets would still have crashed and she would lose the next election to some sort of REAL fascist.
[comment]But all those Bernie supporters told me Trump and Hillary were literally the same....
[comment]You know what I tell the morons on the right? I tell them to live in the here and now. Forget about Hillary and move on. This post is stupid.
[comment]Hillary was great and it is a damn shame so many people who should have known better gleefully engaged in demonizing her
[comment]This also wouldn't of happen if Bernie won, or Jill Stein
[comment]It still would have happened. We would have just been prepared better.
[comment]64 million people voted for her

77k in 3 states decided not to.
[comment]Trump did not vote for Iraq War like Hilary.
[comment]I hate trump more than anyone and of course any functioning adult could have done a better job but it’s unreasonable to say this wouldn’t have happened if Hillary was president.
[comment]Actually, it wouldn't have happened if the moment after Donald Trump declared he wouldn't accept a loss in 2016 because it would've been rigged, the Democrats declared the exact same thing. Especially given how it was the obvious thing to do.
[comment]Are we talking about destroying the image of the US presidency through Twitter?
[comment]Pretty sure China itself is the one to blame, if that Winnie the Pooh acted fast and didn't try to hide it.
[comment]Could we have reacted better or sooner ...yes 
But look at how many asshoels are still out there partying and ignoring rules to social distance. The other thing people don’t consider is how much this would affect the global economy. I believe that really played into how things rolled out. 

Does he lack proper grammar and speaking in full sentences. Yes

Does he contradict himself. Yes

Do people blame him for everything regardless of facts. Yes

Do people continue to share misinformation as facts yes


https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/17/instagram-posts/celebrities-are-sharing-misleading-post-about-trum/

If people could put aside their hate and look at some actually facts we might have a les polarized country. 

The guy does not speak well and is clearly a narcissist but a lot of crap he gets blamed for in just not true. 

Btw the crap the dems are jamming into this bill to pass support is a joke. Make the bill about funding. Ok they can’t agree. Then just agree to pass something but make the bill say we can change or update this in xxx days if needed. And get that crap passes.
[comment]Your right. We would have been bankrupt a lot sooner.
[comment]Hence why we need to vote for Bernie 2020 :)
[comment]oh please, it would’ve happened no matter who won. the matter of the fact is about who would’ve handled it better. 

as someone who doesn’t like Trump or Hillary, nobody would have been able to stop the spread of it completely. it’s just a matter of who would’ve delayed it better. 

trump obviously shit the bed on this one, but to say corona virus wouldn’t have happened if Hillary got elected is just blatantly wrong.
[comment]He tied to tell you idiots about it in January and even put China on a travel ban. He was then in demoncrap fashion called a racist and the ban was overturned by fascist judges. He was trying to keep it from coming here for j the first place but you idiots won’t let him do his job. Oh and thanks for stopping the stimulus package ya wankers.
[comment]Enough with the propaganda posts that keep making it to the front page without that many comments or upvotes
[comment]Yeah, well, the DNC put forward a candidate that people didn't like, and again we're not learning our lesson. Nobody wants establishment centrists.
[comment]Not sure which is more stupid, defending one of the worst nominees for president since John Kerry or pretending like Hillary's magical vagina would stop the impending doom that China's craptastic communist regime that continuously threatens the world on a yearly basis. Nothing could have stopped the incoming plague because of the blatant attempt to cover up and diagnose every person who tried to tell the world about it with the damn kung flu. Even the CDC and the WHO was underplaying this since China was giving them the okey-dokey the entire time. As for Trump allegedly firing an over bloated and over funded organization some time before this was ever even in existence, that's a load of horseshit too.

https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/

Keep using those communist talking points though and sowing deceit and mistrust every where, I'm sure Democrats will eventually win an election even though that your best runner is a shadow of Obama with dementia that not even he will endorse against a full-fledged socialist.
[comment]Bernie would have won.
[comment]This wouldn’t have happened if a damn potato had won
[comment]Your right it would have been worse
[comment]9/11 would not have happened with Gore as President. 

Which would have led to not having loss of freedom over "security", no wars in Iraq/Afghanistan, (okay, the latter one might have happened under Gore, too. It was the base of al quaeda, which was probably gonna need some sort of intervention, eventually. But an intervention started, and controlled by the US, not the terrorists!) no Great recession in '08, and eventually, no Trump.

[comment]And why exactly did she lose again? Did we have a more viable alternative to Hillary?
[comment]We don't know that.

It would have happened in some form.

She is a lying corrupt piece of shit too but not on a trump level...he has his own special category.
[comment]How about the bill giving 8billion to big pharma. Still would have happend. Still corporate buy outs. About time to talk about the system not the figures.
[comment]Even I can do a better job than Trump. The worst of Democrats are better than the GOP
[comment]Let’s blame it all on Trump, because the DNC is on point.

Hey, while we’re stealing Bernies nom, let’s give it to Hillary—they were so successful last time

Calcified, dead on their feet. Trump, Hillary, Biden, the GOP, and the DNC

Old, white, 1%, conservative all of them.

Where is the real, actual left-wing? DOA, that’s where.
[comment]you can’t just epstein the virus away lol saying hillary would have saved us from a global pandemic intentionally stated by the chinese is my fav TDS of the day so thanks for that
[comment]Among so many other things that would have been better - Supreme Court Judges for one.
[comment]You don't know how she would have handled it. It's impossible to predict the future. She could have being amazing at this or even worse than Trump, but we can't know.
[comment]You lost me at “sane, sensible person.” Trump remains repugnant as ever, but Hillary is neither sane nor sensible.
[comment]Meh...I would rather have Bernie in the WH!!
[comment]I know it would be much worst. We would be in an economic mess to begin with going into this virus mess. There would be no fair trade deals. All our companies are in Europe, India, and China.  She wouldn’t have shut down the borders. She is all about embracing everyone to enter in USA.  She doesn’t care about the people but herself and how she is perceived by her party.<|endoftext|>

[comment]We should be taking notes from South Korea. Damn.
[comment]Would not trust those numbers from China, though.
[comment]China is lying
[comment]This is a stupid graph. Per capital matters, population density matters (most of our cases have come from one of the largest cities in the world with highly popular public transportation)

Now, do I think Trump did a good job - hell no.

But these graphs are just misleading.
[comment]Is this per capita? If we have 10x the population of a country we are being compared to then this is critical to account for.
[comment]Please read this understanding that these are hypothetical numbers chosen to illustrate a point about graphs and information presentation rather than argue actual infection rates. 

If country #1 has 1,000,000 residence and country #2 has 300,000,000. And country #1 had 700,000 cases and country #2 has 1.4 million cases. Who is doing the better job of containing it?

This is the flaw in the graph above. If you don't account for the population you will be led to believe that a 50% infection rate is better than a 0.4% infection rate.

Cmon guys get your head out of your ass.
[comment] Those China numbers are BS.
[comment]We aren’t testing properly, so we don’t even have accurate data. This administration is shameful.
[comment]The mayor of NYC should have told people to stock up on food and social distance rather than go on the subway and go to parades.
[comment]Adjust per capita. The numbers are meaningless otherwise.
[comment]You don't have to report cases if you're killing off your population intentionally. Looking at you, China
[comment]Should probably add up the european countries as a better proxy to compare U.S. to though.
[comment]When can we start saying “Thanks, Trump?”
[comment]Most are lying (spoiler alert) plus it's cases per million that shed more light, high school students can do a better excel sheet showing more pertinent data than this crap.

How is it logical to compare USA to any other country when it comes to population as well as overall containment? 

I get the point of the post, but this was low effort to the max. Happy quarantine and it's that damn Carol Baskin!
[comment]Be weary of any numbers from a dictatorship.  Trump "thought" he could blue sky this thing and force people to under-report the enormity and truth if this thing.  China, Iran, India, and other right wing strongman states are under-reporting and hiding numbers at the peril of the world.
[comment]Doesn't really matter which party you fall behind. The harsh truth is that us has been exposed to be unable to handle any sort of fast spreading virus, or bio warfare attack. Terrorists are licking their lips at the sight of our massive failure during something like this
[comment]I’m most curious to see what happens in Sweden. They aren’t requiring any shelter in place or social distancing.
[comment]I’m colour blind..... completely ..... graphs like this drive me nuts...

[comment]I am shocked, shocked I say! Well not that shocked.
[comment]This is totally on Trump.
[comment]Aren't the democrats the people who don't want us to have national healthcare, just so the already wealthy can profit a little bit more?
[comment]Yeah I'm gonna go with not trusting the China numbers. The entire Chinese bureaucracy is based on fudging numbers and there is no way to get an accurate estimate of their infection rate/death rate. Even if China knew the numbers, they would make sure no one else knows the numbers. 

Still, the US response or lack thereof has been an abject failure.

[comment]A few thoughts here:

1. A cumulative graph that isn't normalized is going to necessarily look worse for a large country (China notwithstanding with likely bad data.)
2. This data is 8 days old. A lot has happened since then.
3. Confirmed data is effectively meaningless since there's no consistency globally in testing per capita or even test quality. Chinese tests are notoriously bad, and some countries are testing more per capita than others (easier to roll out testing in ROK than in France.)

For all the self-hatred we have here in the US, the US is actually testing more than most of the countries on this list except for Germany and ROK, but it's simply not enough to get actual population-level data when you're at 7000 per 1m or even 10k per 1m if the testing isn't RANDOM or at least a designed sample. 

And depending on how you parse the data, the US is flattening as well:

[https://www.ft.com/\_\_origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260)

That's also clear in the daily new cases data:

[comment]This is what happenes when every first world nation has universal healthcare.  We are the most broken sespool on the planet and yall can thank republicans 100 percent
[comment]You should bear in mind that a lot more people are being tested in China than the US.
[comment]Thanks, trump
[comment]I’ve heard people criticize this for not taking population into account, but America’s population is actually not that huge, we are on the other side of the globe from the original source, we are very spread out, ales had tons of warning, and we have more money to deal with the virus than anyone else. It is still absurd and infuriating that we haven’t done better.

That is some icky phrasing.
[comment]Moderates aren’t the enemy. Obama/Biden are the ones who changed the national dialogue on healthcare and fought to expand Medicare to all ages. That’s a fact. They couldn’t get the full public option because of actual moderates, like Joe Lieberman
[comment]The article doesn't quite make this link, but the rejection of Bernie is also linked to Trump. We've already seen the insurgent candidate, the purity test, the refusing to reach out, the Hardline views without a hint of compromise. it's exactly Trump's playbook from 2016, and look how that turned out.
[comment]Then why have they been treating him as the enemy?
[comment]It's quite something to watch how the tone of the Biden and Sanders newspieces have shifted from before to after super Tuesday.
[comment]Too late to change that. Too bad.
[comment]His base just needs to vote. Talk about FDR and restoring the democratic vision. Lay off the revolution. Maybe. I dunno.
[comment]How anyone complains after what the DNC had put Bernie through,  I can't comprehend!  Lie, cheat,  steal in our faces, almost brag about out, and do anything to keep him out makes us all want to vote for him more.......JS. Keep up the free strength of his following!! :)
[comment]It will extremely hard to convince Sanders supporters to flip to Biden come the GE. Policies are so opposite. 

It’ll be really hard to be an organizer for Sanders, canvassing on policies of medicare for all, then switching to expanding the ACA (something a majority of democrats disapprove of).

[comment]About fucking time.
[comment]So, he gets impeached. Not removed. Re-Elected. 
Does some other High Crimes etc etc. Can he be impeached again (in 2nd term)?
[comment]Now the question - largely rhetorical - is whether our leaders intend to see this through, or whether they're just doing the bare minimum for plausible deniability and intend to let Republicans stop them.

Removing Donald Trump from power is not optional if this to be a free country, so none of the procedural obstacles to doing so are a rational basis for failure - they're just excuses that politicians would use if they're just posturing.

So, one of two things happens, and we know which is overwhelmingly likely: Either Donald Trump is removed from power, or there will never be a free election for President of the United States in this country again.

The fact that the impeachment charges don't include Espionage is not encouraging.  

It looks perfunctory.  

For three years, this country has not had a federal government.  Verbally acknowledging a tiny handful of the crimes committed by the insurgent regime squatting in our institutions...it's so little, and so late.

Though I'll never say "too" little or too late.
[comment]This isn't the end of the fight, it's just the beginning.
[comment]See y’all in r/drunk tonight lol
[comment]Its good that we did it but i doubt anything will happen as a result , it makes me sad
[comment]This is only the first step.

But it feels pretty damn good.
[comment]“I’m not orange, impeached”
[comment]Boo hoo hoo. Cry me a river. What a scumbag trump is. He can go eat a big bag of shit. Exactly what he deserves.
[comment]Press F to dab on the Grave of the GOP
[comment]He’s not impeached yet, lol. It has to pass the senate. Why is everyone saying he’s impeached? Wasn’t there enough “Hillary will be the next president” and “no way he could win” for y’all to be jumping the gun like this again?

Take a breath and wait for the rest of it to play out. We might not be out of this yet.
[comment]So you all must be so proud. As a Veteran who served in Afghanistan it makes me outraged that Pelosinwould even mention our service when referring to this debochal. I hope you look forward to OUR President Trump for the next term as well.
[comment]Trump 2020 here we come!!!!
[comment]Oh, the places we could go...if McConnell can't move the bills on his desk that gives us time to impeach Pence.
[comment]Yes, agree. We, I, need to do everything to ensure this isn’t an issue. 

Thanks for the info. 

GBA. (God Bless America)
[comment]A bunch of Republicans are saying we lost somehow, and that this is the destruction of our party. Even if somehow that's the case, "Strike me down in anger, and I shall grow more powerful than you could possibly imagine."
[comment]Lotta brigading here tonight.
[comment]#DumpTrump
[comment]Honestly I'll feel better when more of the people who support him within the government. At this point, the Republican Party.
[comment]"Now it goes to trial in the Senate. Now is when his true game will unfold. He let them get this far. Because now in the trial at the Senate he can subpoena each and every person testifying and force out evidence of the corruption of the very people accusing him of being corrupt. Don't let the media fool you, Trump wanted this to happen. They paint him as a fool, but in reality he has been playing them from the beginning. He knew they wouldn't stand for him winning, he knew they would come for him. But in doing so they exposed their flank, they got so caught up in their scheme to impeach him that they forgot to cover their asses and what impeachment opens up. They have just given Trump the power to expose them all."
[comment]Suck on that, Republican Traitors. You and your boy are stains on the taint of history now.
[comment]Democrats making free campaign for president Trump, you guys just ensured his victory again.
Brainlets.
[comment]Yeah and wait till it gets to the senate, y'all do know that the Senate has a Republican majority right?
[comment]Lmao, by the House ~~of Commons~~. The ~~lords~~ senate will overrule this nonsense.
[comment]Ok boomer
[comment]I will stay indepdent I don't want to be a puppet of any party and I have voted Republican at one Point and Democratic at another time.

 I just at this time don't think I could ever vote Republican again, to say that protecting Trump and his behavior in general seems like mass hypocrisy..on a value system neoconservative say we should have As Americans. 

There action seem just based on the gaining of power and money.

  Digging deep into racial fears and dviding the country like pieces of pie.

[comment]Lmao
[comment]We are now entering the most dangerous time with a mentally unstable POTUS. Vlad Putin will never have a better time to make a move than before Trump is gone and a new President is installed. Pence can't be trusted.

Thank God for Speaker Pelosi. Ever notice that Nancy Pelosi is always the smartest person in the room?

[comment]Just wait until we count up all of the mysterious pneumonia deaths in each state.
[comment]We are closing in on the number of Americans killed in WW1.
[comment]It's fine we have plenty of human capital stock. We're only cleaning out the useless ones. Or the brown ones. Or the ones that can't fight for us anymore....../s
[comment]Cue rage tweets
[comment][Much more than 100k if you consider misclassification of pneumonia deaths - link to Reddit discussion and local news article for Kentucky](https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gqypwx/kentucky_has_had_913_more_pneumonia_deaths_than/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

[comment]This beginning to sound like something you'd see in an apocalypse movie
[comment]Just mind blowing that 42.7% of people think he’s doing just fine
[comment]We should see a spike again in about 2-3 weeks when the people who caught it this weekend spread spread it through the population w/o even knowing.
[comment]It passed 100k deaths about an hour ago.
[comment]Almost 2 million infections and over 100k deaths ... so much for 15cases going to 0 ... 3 months ago. SAD!
[comment]I see posts like this, then I check Instagram and see posts of people I went to high school with at a Trump boat parade.
[comment]Trump's rating is the lowest it's ever been. Imagine how easy it would have been to elect someone who would have changed something but I guess that'll have to wait another 4 years and another hundred thousand americans dead to inaction
[comment]For god sake can we just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange füher from office please
[comment]Yeah but his Kult will still support him and drink his Koolaid.
[comment]funny how democratic states are suffering worse from coronavirus... hmmmmm....
[comment]The shit will hit the fan at two million deaths. Armed insurrection at twenty million dead.

<|startoftext|>[title]81% of Americans disagree with right-wing anti-quarantine mobs
[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/4/20/21225016/protests-stay-at-home-orders-trump-conservative-group-michigan[comment]Huh.. That high..  that'd include a lot of tRumpies
[comment]What can you tell us about the 19%?
[comment]Though 100% of the 19% agree with ending immigration during this trying time
[comment]Even my dad thinks these guys are jackasses and he is a hardcore trumper.
[comment]So 19% are MAGA nuts...  I'm surprised there are that many nuts out there, but maybe most at least have a good since to stay inside and not protest.   Though them getting out they're asking to catch the virus, I really hope none of them get it.  It's like that pastor that made a big deal about defying the stay at home orders to hold church service, then he died from the virus.  I don't wish this on anyway, but if they don't stay put and abide by social distancing and wear masks it's inevitable some will get it.
[comment]These are obviously small pockets of idiots being organized by right-wing groups that are very likely organized themselves and funded by the groups working to get Trump reelected. This is a very calculated move made to cast a bad light on blue governors, considering the vast majority of the protests that have occurred at any sort of scale have been in predominantly states with a Democrat Governor and Democrat majority state congress.
[comment]&gt;Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

The idiocy of the jackass holding that sign is painful...
[comment]Haha “Give me liberty or give me Covid 19”....wow, wow, wow. What’s the logic behind their claims? Do they not care if they are infected? Do they not care if other people are infected? I can understand why they want to get out of quarantine, they want to work, just like everyone else. But considering how the situation is in the US now, it’s better for everyone to stay home.
[comment]1/5 of Americans agree with right-wing anti-quarantine mobs. thats terrifying.
[comment]Seems like the rural folks are jealous that the urban folks have all the Covid they want some for themselves. Idiots.
[comment]&gt; Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

That can be arranged.
[comment]19% is 19% more than 3 months ago. At this rate, it will be a majority by election! /s
[comment]Disagree is much too gentle. I find these people to be disgusting. They are ignorant, they are selfish, they are putting others in harms way because they've bought into right wing propaganda. I hope they are ALL held accountable to the full extent of the law. We need to make sure every one is identified and charged.
[comment]19% of Americans are fucking insane.
[comment]Trump plus Fox News are a fatal combo for these sad folk. But these actions will affect those that are following SIP, masks and distancing.
[comment]If only they couldn’t spread it to others I’d say let em die.
[comment]They are just virus vectors.
[comment]They are fake, astroturf mobs.
[comment]Fringe nuts. Every country has them unfortunately.
[comment]they're just following their god emperor's commands. I wanna see all 81% of those polled at the ballot box this november.
[comment]The “no lives matter” movement.
[comment]&gt;“You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.”

Polling around that time put Trump around 38-40% so yeah, that’s where the ~19% are from. I find comfort that they are isolating themselves from the other ~20% they need to win elections.
[comment]Protests you don’t agree with are mobs now?

Propaganda much?
[comment]But dRump agrees with them and is inciting them to continue. He is directly responsible for the second wave when it comes.
[comment]It seems like there are so many of them cause they are so LOUD. But I think most people with any brain at all get that these people are insane. I even have some hardcore trump supporters in my family who think they are being ridiculous. I am trying to bite my tongue in telling them that is how they all sound when trying to defend that monster.... lol
[comment]If they were only putting themselves in danger I’d laugh. These people are murderers
[comment]Sadly, 1 in 5 are still misguided.....I miss Barack
[comment]815 of Americans disagree with dying, hmmm
[comment]Here's what the "expert" observers are missing: Trump and his conservative backers have to do this because the total self-identified GOP base shrunk since 2016 from 29% to 24%.

In other words, he only has his core supporters (Trumpers) and his sift support from '16 left the party or left their mortal coil (+65).  

So, they are left with stunts, praying for low turnout, suppression tactics, and a narcissistic sociopath who can't shut up.  Nevermind his poor performance and where we are today.  The. GOP is effectively HIS terminal base.  The results in the 2018 Congressional, Virginia, Kentucky, and Mississippi's governor's races are bellwethers proving that.

The media is still going to sell the horserace, though.
[comment]When 81 percent of Americans agree on anything, they’re almost guaranteed to be ignored
[comment]We should issue protest permits to them but limit it to the covid critical care wards.
[comment]Assuming the ~20% are mostly Trumpy conservatives, this means that there is a relatively sizeable number of conservatives who are still reachable with logic and evidence, given the circumstances.
[comment]Phoenix these idots popped up and like in Colorado nurses showed up to counter protest. It's sad that the very people they rely on for medical care and maybe one day life saving emergency care are the one's they endanger and disrespect. Those same medical professionals will provide the care because its engrained in their DNA to help no matter who or what. Mindblowing
[comment]What about the other 19%. How was the questioned asked because I would be horrified if 19% actually believed in this.

I have not read the article yet but I’ll get to it.

Edit: just read the article and it’s 19% believed that we need less Social distancing which could just mean a slow economy which I disagree with but is better then these protesters.
[comment]that’s weird. usually the split between sane people and crazies in this country ends up being roughly 60/40
[comment]Who would have thought?
[comment]Is this really a partisan issue?
[comment]AMERICA: ONLY 19% STUPID! 

JUST GIVE US ANOTHER 236 YEARS! 

WE WILL GET THOSE PEOPLE WISED UP!
[comment]So about 70 million agree?
[comment]Conservatives are hilarious. They'll protest abortion claiming they are saving lives, but then protest quarantine measures when it's been shown shelter in place is saving lives.

I don't get it.
[comment]Only 81%?  1 in 5 Americans supports thinks epidemiology is fiction?   

Whoa boy ...
[comment]Christian ISIS? CHRISIS?
[comment]The context of the survey was:

“should continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy.”

The protesters were against the lockdown and not necessarily social distancing.  This is a blatant misinterpretation of the poll.
[comment]If I see these protestors in Albuquerque I'm going to hell shit at them.
[comment]This all illustrates sowing and reaping. The Governors who are opening too early are going to get all sorts of great results for the first three weeks and it is after that that the hospitalizations and deaths will start growing and growing. As in so many other things, what you reap comes much later than what you sow. Before reaping the Whirlwind there is often a time when stupid decisions look absolutely perfect.
[comment]Similar to 2008, a national (international) emergency of an enormous magnitude has suddenly upended the presidential race in favor of Democrats. Americans trust Democrats on healthcare far more than Republicans, it is one of the Democrats best issues - Biden, with his folksy, moderate seeming attitudes only helps. The POTUS planned to run on the economy, now collapsed, and had no plans for running on healthcare - his attempts to open the economy show the desperation to return to an economic focus. Biden's lead over Trump is now in the double-digits nationally and well into them when it comes to the Pandemic and healthcare more broadly.
[comment]They show up with guns because it helps make them appear less impotent. There should be no guns allowed at a legally organized rally. It limits those with different opinions. The students at Kent state in Ohio in 1970 didn't have guns. They weren't children like these grown men.
[comment]Boy do I live and work in the wrong place. It feels like I’m the minority.
[comment]Saw this on Twitter.  From now on they should be called the Flu Klux Klan.
[comment]Despite making up only 19% of the population, alt-right nutjobs will be responsible for 100% of the deaths from this point onwards.
[comment]The Very Loud, Very Vocal, Minority American Right.
[comment]Did you ask every 263 million Americans or is this based on a small sample of left-leaning people. No offense but just curious.
[comment]Fuck every asshole protesting quarantines
[comment]I'm so sad to admit my MIL attended one... Thank goodness for living states away
[comment]I've been reading through both what libs and cons have been saying about these protests, and I must say I've been absolutely horrified by what the (I can only hope) small libertarian part of the GOP is saying. Do you have rights? Yes you do. Are they inalienable? Yes, but again, 'Constitution is not a suicide pact.' 
I've seen so many dumbasses give some of the most braindead arguments in favor of the protest. Guess what? Theres a way for you to test the constitutional validity of what you're doing; it's called the fucking supreme court. I really hope that from the next time some dumbfuck starts on this 'freedom to protest' psychobabble, please tell them to fight it out in a court of law, rather than putting everyone's lives at risk....
[comment]you know how in Iran ppl would be paid to protest and carry Death to America signs and get free lunches so it would look like there was a mass hatred of America?  I think this is the American version of this.
[comment]It’s not a right wing protest, just pockets of idiots.
[comment]It saddens me that it’s only 81%
[comment]im pretty sure there are left-wing people who are also anti-quarantine.  Saying its only right-wing people is just pure propaganda.
[comment]Protest and die, proving Darwin right yet again...
[comment]I agree that the number is substantial, as it should be, but please God don’t use Vox as an *actual* source. It’s horseshit.
[comment]All it takes it one positive test and the health department can quarantine all of them.
[comment]That still leaves way too many people.
[comment]There are some Republican Governors and representatives doing an ok job. However they don’t have the balls to speak against trump and will pander to his rhetoric despite them secretly doing the right things as blue state governors. I am from NC and our governor is a Democrat and he is getting so much shade. I suspect though it is a vocal minority doing this. I live in the RTP and all the Republicans I know agree the state should be shut for now. They say things like we have to reopen eventually but should be shut for now. Nonetheless the mainstream GOP will pander to the organized right wing nut job organizations<|endoftext|>

I mean it's freaking sad.[comment]i will send you your merit badge in the mail.
[comment]that's the GOP for ya.
[comment]No one can stand to hear any criticism anymore.
[comment]Their ideas can't survive contact with reasonable people. 

Treat your ban like the compliment that it is.
[comment]👍🖐️✌️ to all my Democratic unknown friends out there in the Reddit world, thank you for the replies to my post. Quick story yesterday I was in a sub and there's a democratic Bernie Backer putting up posts and then I put up replies because I'm not a Bernie Backer, I am a Biden backer, we both had our back and forth and at the end of the conversation the worst it got was "we have to agree to disagree" now that's what you call a sensible conversation between 2 Democrats/people that don't agree on there potential nominees, but there's one thing about me and I hope about all the Democrats out there, I am backing whoever the nominee for the Democratic nomination is it doesn't matter, we have to get the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpf and his dictatorial administration out of office so please stay together and vote Democrat no matter who is our nominee and thanks again
[comment]I actually requested the mods ban me after I got into a good little spat on r/Republican (and they obliged me). It was liberating as I no longer attempt to squeeze any semblance of common sense out of the deplorables by using arguments that they have historically beat everyone else over the head with. TL;DR - congratulations!
[comment]It’s a cult of personality thing with Trump. It’s sort of similar with Sanders types. Any dissent is met with extreme vitriol. Fortunately, the Democratic Party has not been radicalized like the Republican Party. Big tent.
[comment]I mean all it takes is one member of the secret service who actually cares about his country and then Trump will cease to exist
[comment]I'm probably older than you but that doesn't mean anything as far as who someone votes for, I just think Joe Biden will bring people back together around this country and especially our allies but he also beats drumpf in all the poles not that I give polls too much credit anymore, also Bernie and Elizabeth Warren are, I think to left for the majority of Democrats and Republicans that will come on our side and vote with us. I'm not for Medicare for all, I'm not for free this or free that, but what I am for is, if it happens to come down to Bernie or Elizabeth Warren or any other Democrat vs this demonic entity we have in Washington you better damn well believe that I'm voting for the Democrat.
[comment]Congrats Blue Hero!
[comment]I'm banned from there and conservative too. 

I think one of them I was a bit antagonistic and kind of hostile. 

The other one I genuinely was just trying to get someone to elaborate and explain their view. I wasn't trying to troll and instigate anything. I just wanted understand why they felt the way they did and try to look at their side. 

They just threw out personal attacks at liberals and Democratic politicians and said we're/they're idiots. 

I asked again to explain again without using liberals or Democrats in their explanation and Im now banned.
[comment]you should take a peek over at r/POLITIC

it's basically T_D vs the world with no mods.
[comment]I did that a while back (on purpose) asking how if your innocent is nobody willing to testify under oath type of snarky comment. Comment removed and I had a temporary ban.
[comment]If it makes you feel better, i’ve been banned from there for a solid 6 months
[comment]I got banned from that sub for pointing out, in a completely rational tone, the fact that Trump committed bribery. So yeah, they are in fantasy land.
[comment]Never apologize.
[comment]I got permanently banned from r/politics for saying that I'd pay good money to give Junior a good slapping.

Seemed a bit arbitrary, but whatever.
[comment]I got banned for quoting Trump **verbatim**, word for word, in opposition of whatever was current party line at that time...
[comment]I was banned from a Republican group on Facebook for trying to set them straight.
[comment]Surprisingly I'm not banned despite some wholehearted attempts at it. I like to pop in there every once and a while to remind them that they're ignorant racists and cheerleading polices they jeered at when it was a democrat enacting them.

[comment]um we both have the same rules? you just broke them

[comment]Now I understand how you wrote that post about the propaganda my apologies to you sir, if you are the moderator of this room keep up the good work because you are letting people speak their mind within certain boundaries which there should be and I will do my best to stay within those boundaries I never purposely try to disrespect anybody for speaking truth and facts.
[comment]I was banned from politics for telling someone that they are a bad person for supporting Kavanaugh, which I believe.  


And from Pete Buttigieg for not thinking we should listen to neo-cons like Jen Rubin about Iraq/Iran
[comment]Figures. I’ve noticed that conservatives and republicans don’t take kindly to people having other opinions than they do. I’m fine with it. They aren’t.

In fact, just a few minutes ago somebody posted on my insta that I should leave the country because I’m a Democrat. It really shows the maturity of that while party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]The broadcast of the Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday drew 19.7 million viewers across NBC and MSNBC, making it the most-watched Democratic debate in television history, the network said
[selftext]https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/483889-nevada-democratic-debate-draws-record-breaking-197-million-viewers[comment]Good. I hope the voter turnout is bigger than ever as well.
[comment]That's great and all, but where can you watch it right now, after the fact, in full and without commentary over it?  Go try and watch it on the official NBC youtube channel, the video is 2.5 hours long, the first hour is preparatory commentary and the last hour-and-a-half is a static graphic and no sound, no debate, no content, no nothing.
[comment]It was a great debate. Glad so many tuned in. 

Klobuacher and Warren were pretty spicy. 

Bloomberg really bombed. He wasn’t well prepared for the push back and reaction from the other candidates.
[comment]I went in hoping to watch everyone take a collective shit on Bloomberg. I was not disappointed. I was also ecstatic to see Warren finally take that stick out of her ass, and proceed to beat him to death with it
[comment]Warren’s campaign should be ecstatic, she had a great performance and hopefully sees a boost in her numbers. Bernie went into the night as the front runner and his performance solidified that. Amy and Pete are fighting for the moderate spot and hoping Joe just crash and burns. Bloomberg left in a body bag, and it was awesome to watch.
[comment]I watched mostly to see Warren hammer the new york pork dork
[comment]Question from a foreigner: What is the fanfare/anthem played in the introductiom and during breaks? I hear it being played on podcasts about politics too when they are discussing the primaries.
[comment]Any explanation why? 

All the other debates have been steady decreases and lows for Democratic debates, most averaging around 6.5 mil if I remember correctly?

Did this many people tune in for Bloomberg or did they just tune in after hearing a billionaire was getting roasted on national television? 

So interesting
[comment]It was a snuff film, I can't see Bloomberg coming back to life after that showing.
[comment]If I'm Warren, and to a lesser degree Biden, this is great news.
[comment]Do us that number include streaming?
[comment]That kind of surprises me.  There's no one who's really caught on and stood out as the frontrunner, but maybe that's why, because so many people need to make a decision.
[comment]How do I watch it now?
[comment]"According to these numbers we have, which were created by our own company, about our own company's product, this was the Greatest Show on Earth!"

-Seriously, though, I felt like I was watching a highly scripted WWE performance.
[comment]So 9.7 million people watched Bloomberg get his ass handed to him?
[comment]Big night for Warren, Pete, Biden

Bernie got hit hard for the first time of his life but maintains his lead. 

Bloomberg cannot purchase a better reputation so he’s not really a viable candidate anymore. I really, really hope his following dies. 

Klobuchar cannot outflank Buttigieg or Biden, she’s simply going to run out of money - soon. The more she tries to make it look like she’s punching down on Pete the worse she looks.
[comment]A big part of this was curiosity about the billionaire who had bought his way onstage. And I'm very glad to know that 20 million people watched him be eviscerated by Warren.
[comment]They were all fighting each other. I don’t think I like any of them if they can’t stop
[comment]Shout out to Tom Perez, who took a ton of flak for adjusting the requirements that put Bloomberg into the debate instead of letting him hide behind TV ads where nobody could criticize him to his face. Bloomberg was polling too well not to be vetted and he was vetted in spectacular fashion. Everyone who was criticizing Perez should realize he knew this was going to happen all along.
[comment]Warren does so well with these things.  She eviscerated Bloomberg rather cleanly.
[comment]Of all the ones to be most watched, yikes!
[comment]It’s pretty blatantly obvious after watching the “replays” NBC and MSNBC are posting, that they want to minimize the damage done to ol’ NY Fuckface because ALL audience reactions are entirely cut short. I cannot find a replay in it’s entirety. Anyone have a link?
[comment]Does anyone else find Pete super smug? I want to like him but I just can’t the more I actually watch him. He speaks eloquently sure but I just find him giving off such smug vibes. Which seems weird because he has such little experience. Is it just me?
[comment]What a disgrace. Warren and Kolbawhatever should take a piss and fuck off. Pete should go back to his village. Bloomberg should learn how to speak. Biden sounds too desperate. 40 years in Government nothing happened. Tell him to go fuck Thomas in the Supreme Court as he was a disgrace in the senate the way he behaved with dr. Hill. Sander should go past fucking sound bites. I am ashamed to be a democratic.
[comment]The networks should be basically only broadcasting these debates on these days. Regularly scheduled programming is halted for the SOTU address, for baseball games and other things many of which are also unnecessary. They should be halting regular programming so that everyone is watching this and can actually make decisions that are informed by what they have seen and heard for themselves, not by the blatant partisan and biased views of the networks.
[comment]Lies, I watched, nothing historical about it
[comment]Why is Bloomberg there?

How did he possibly qualify after joining late and ...No on liking him???

Was he any good? On Colbert he came across as just unnecessary and insincere and weak.
[comment]That’s great news.  Now, DNC, don’t fuck it up this time.
[comment]I thought it was really good.  They got out all of the issues on people's mind about each candidate and they debated it.  Hopefully, they also got rid of Bloomberg too.  Warren demonstrated what a Trump Lite he is..Bloomberg hoeing humming about releasing his taxes(just like Trump)...Warren ain't having that either. "Do the work. Get it done!" LOL "And release the women who you have under non-disclosure for sexual harassment etc so they can speak and tell us their side of the story...rich men have tried to muzzled women for years and that is NOT what this party is about!" MY THOUGHTS: No one becomes a billionaire without compromising on morals/dirty or questionable dealings. 9 Million+ lobbying for his company's benefit. Bloomberg paid slave wages and bought off sexual harassment/discrimination cases to make his fortune. Bloomberg has long opposed financial regulations and raised money for Tom DeLay, the Republican former House majority leader who was convicted on money laundering charges in 2010. Additionally, as mayor(which he bought his way into)and numerous other republicans.

He is conveniently a republican when it suits him..Bloomberg supported the police department’s “stop-and-frisk” policy that disproportionately targeted minority men. Makes racist comments almost as often as Trump. And for whatever reason he denies the scientific and economic benefits of legalized marijuana.. Apparently, he doesn't even know what a transgender person is let alone how to provide justice and equity for them. I'm sure he has a ton of baggage we haven't heard about but sorry I want a true public servant, not a billionaire playing at being one.
[comment]Wow! Everyone really got to see their favorite politicians in action!
[comment]Yeah, I think Cortez could be powerful in the senate as a majority/ minority leader. Somehow I see her getting the whip on other congressmen and congresswomen. Only time will tell.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Election Day should be a day off work nationwide.
[comment]Dem governors in swing states need to do this to drive turnout to defeat trump good job
[comment]Dont call it a comeback.
[comment]So you’re saying a guy from the South, who grew up 40 years ago, and was in a jokey black face picture, can actually accomplish great things, for black people and progressives, if he isn’t a victim of progressive cancel culture?
[comment]What are the benefits of eliminating voter ID?
[comment]This man just eliminated any chance of Republicans winning elections in Virginia again.
[comment]According to Republicans this is cheating.
[comment]👍👍👍👍👍👍
[comment]Is this feasible to expand to other Southern states?  I'm campaigning for a seat in the Georgia General Assembly.  Is this a top-level issue that would resonate with Georgia voters?  (Right under healthcare, obviously.)
[comment]Why are voting rights a partisan issue? Furthermore, why are Republicans ok with being on the OTHER SIDE?
[comment]Bam!     Take that you cheatin sneakin Repubs!
[comment]How do you only vote once without an id?
[comment]More demonrat policy eroding our democracy.
[comment]Well we in Washington are better than everyone else as we don't need a day to vote.  We get out ballot in the mail when we're registered and have around a MONTH to mail it in free or drop it off in a secured ballot box.. thus eliminating the need for volunteering at polling places, poll watchers, traffic, lines, worrying about voter ID...and this is coming from a conservative whose lived here for 2 years now up from the Deep South..aka...assbackwardsville.
[comment]There's some republicans with frosty balls in VA right now. Prep for the retaliation.
[comment]I live in Las Vegas but should vote in Virginia just to prove how stupid it is not to require an ID to vote. Do I love in Virginia? Oh of course I do, I’ve been living here my whole life? ID? No I don’t have any ID, I live in Alexandria, yea, that’s the ticket! I live on Broadway, yea, that’s the street! Can I have my ballot now?
[comment]I don't understand why we would eliminate voter ID instead of just providing everyone a free and easy way to acquire ID. There is no way that "no ID no problem!" is the perfect solution.
[comment]Bad news for Republicans,  good news for all of Virginia.
[comment]Uh huh. Where's the mail in ballot? Been doing it forever in Washington. Get with it.
[comment]It's crazy that this is a partisan issue
[comment]Love.
[comment]This is the way.
[comment]They as in the dirty ass Republicans will never make this a holiday because they know more people come out on the Democratic side than the Republican side and they would get their asses beat, just like what's going to happen in November!!
[comment]Amazing news. We’re going to hold Virginia now. Hopefully this will work towards eliminating other Republican holdouts across the state.

[comment]That was "get fucked" in political speak
[comment]What a scumbag completely dodged the question. He knows hes guilty they asked about your SON!! Of course your tax returns are clean
[comment]If Hunter did something wrong prosecute his ass. Meanwhile Trump's kids sit in the White House grifting millions. Sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.
[comment]Doesn’t it seem odd that this is the second heckler in about a week for Biden?  Is it all a production?
[comment]Can we not bury our heads in the sand and pretend Biden didn't potentially have equally dirty dealings in Ukraine.
[comment]It would be nice to have a representative that doesn't ingratiate himself or herself. Where can we find one of those?
[comment]Mic drop!
[comment]This is good because it works for either Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.  The only 2 people running in 2020 who haven't released their tax returns, and who have supporters that spend all day heckling candidates at their town halls.
[comment]The media keeps allowing this "whataboutism" to continue.  The answer every time needs to be, "There has been no wrong doing by Hunter Biden. If they wish to investigate him, they can do that, it has nothing to do with Trump's abuse of power and cover up."
[comment]It’s insane how partisan this whole topic is. Is there no one else that believes it unethical and immoral for members of either party and their families to be profiteering off of their government  offices? 

It’s wrong. It doesn’t matter if there is a R or D behind your name.
[comment]But but....Hillary's emails. Benghazi.
[comment]Aw the good ol move the goalposts
[comment]Solid response
[comment]I'm confused, if someone doesn't like Biden then they automatically like Trump? Is that the only options there are? Where does that leave me? Because I don't like Biden and despise Trump. Guess I don't exist.
[comment]Ah yes taxes the thing no rich person has ever lied about ever
[comment]It blows my mind that Trump supporters stopped caring about his tax returns.

Our President fucking promised us something 4 years ago, and now he is literally fighting  in the courts tooth and nail to renig on that promise, right in front of us! It's really offensive to our intelligence
[comment]The presidency is in the mud and joe decided to join him.
[comment]Biden's treating this story the same way Hillary treated the email story.  Better to just come clean and get it over with, get it behind you instead of keeping it in the news.  What is it with these old Dems just completely incapable of admitting something they did seemed shitty and pledging to do better?
[comment]That's deflecting the question however
[comment]That's a non answer lolololol
[comment]Imagine believing that if people don't support you they de facto support Trump... Joe Biden's gross and if we give him the nomination we'll lose the election.
[comment]Heh, no wonder trump is already trying to [back out of debates](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/2019/12/trump-may-skip-2020-debates-concerned-about-moderators.html). 2020 is going to be hilarious.
[comment]Just throwing this out there. What if Biden came out and agreed to testify, in exchange for Trump agreeing to do the same?
[comment]And please notice that the hecklers were not thrown out, as Trump did to the ones at his rally. Who is the fascist now?
[comment]I’m sorry but I’m what world is hedging a question admirable?
[comment]Lol, got to love joe. 

If biden's son did soemthing, he would have been in front of congress 3 years ago with hillary. 

And both would be in jail. 

Yet all the gop has now is "what exactly happened in the Ukraine?" Which means either they have done zero investigations and are incompetent, or did the investigations, found nothing, and just want to pretend they didn't and don't have a clue.
[comment]👏👏👏👏👏 Go Joe!
[comment]Forget about his filthy ass daughter/sons/family what about the bitch himself Donald j drumpf, not having and or releasing any transcripts from 5 meetings with the freaking dictator of Russia? and ordering his interpreter to destroy all the notes from said meetings what about the meetings with the scumbags from Saudi Arabia and the scumbag from Turkey, now that's fucking dirty and that's why he's a dirty rotten (possible traitor)national security risk.

Me, after winning the lotto tomorrow and putting it all in index funds: "American's have a constitutional right to assemble, worship God, and shoot guns at the same time."
[comment]Is he even offering any policy? Or is he just going to keep spouting rhetoric and platitudes?
[comment]Tell that to the million Iraqis you helped kill, fucking hypocrite!
[comment]Wow, Joe is so brave!
[comment]In other news, terrorism is bad and airplanes fly fast.
[comment]Did he really say all that without bumbling his words?
[comment]Wow, I thought Joe disappeared after the last debate.  Good to know a few weeks after the outbreak and after Bernie raised millions in relief that Joe feels that we shouldn't just allow citizens to die.  What a bold and courageous statement Joe!  I'm sure neo-liberals feel the same way.
[comment]Trump: "We should be prepared to let a lot of seniors die to save our economy."

Biden: "We should **not** do that."

Everyone: "I just *don't know who to vote for!*"

[comment]He didnt mention job.  Let's face it. Some of us are being considered expendable.  My factory is still working building battery test systems.  Grocers gas station attendants and other low wage people who cant afford to voluntarily stay home are being forced to risk themselves and their families with 0 additional compensation. None of us have any hope that we will be remembered when this is done. We are not getting hazard pay and very few companies are offering us anything more than work your shitty job twice as hard for the same pay with more risk.  We cant just go get new jobs. We are stuck and we are being taken advantage of.  While most of the world is relaxing at home we are hurting ourselves for you. It's great that the govs are putting out stimulus checks and paying for up to 90%of companies salaries.  Bailouts for companies who used their cash reserves to buy back stock instead of taking care of its worker.  Every one of us that works at this level understands something a lot of the people making decisions dont seem to get.  They can always replace us.  Always. There will always be someone out there in a worse position. So they will  agree to anything in hope's of taking one more step up. There are plenty of memes saying thank you.  But tbh that doesnt do shit for any of us.  Your thank yous dont pay for my food or rent.  Your thank yous do not get us the ppe we need to stay safe. We keep working while you cry about staying home.. do you have any idea how much we would like to have a 2 week vacation at home?  We are the people least likely to have ever had such time off yet we are the ones being pushed to keep working.  We are looked down on and paid shit every day now all the sudden we are " essential "
[comment]Then support m4a or your words are meaningless.
[comment]I agree.  I saw Sanders say the same many times recently.

But where has joe been? I even heard a rumour he has the virus and is gravely ill.   I would hope if he plans on being president he embraces Medicare for all as this crisis is showing the true cost of care and the division in America the wealth divide creates.
[comment]Was this tweeted from behind a podium in his living room
[comment]As a current registered Democrat, I much prefer Bernie Sanders's proactive response to the crisis. I am glad Joe Biden has finally spoken up. I'm also glad the Joe Biden had decided to follow Bernie Sanders' leadership which has been primarily focused on, We The People. :-)
[comment]Biden needs to be doing a daily briefing- He and Cuomo should basically take over the job Trump isn't doing and just do it.
[comment]Let me be very clear: The coronavirus is a bad thing.
[comment]Oh I don't know, we could stand to lose Trump...
[comment]Well Joe, that's not how capitalism works. The whole point of the system is that workers are expendable.
[comment]How amazing is it that this has to be said?
[comment]Anyone else sick of them starting every statement with LMBVC
[comment]Too bad all Trump cares about is his reelection and the stock market! He knew about this from intelligence months ago and did nothing!
If anyone else with a soul was running the country and felt the way Joe does,  the situation would not be as bad as this. And THEY would not have turned down the test kits from the World Health Organisation so we could test far more people to help contain this virus. I wish someone could find a way to shut Trump up and stop his constant lies!
[comment]This sounds great.  Now SHOW me you mean it.
[comment]wow...so brave....where does he find the courage?
[comment]Mad King Trump is probably expendable.
[comment]It’s funny that Ive heard Bernie so much in the last few weeks that he almost starting to get on my nerves, but the first thing that Biden says (and he’s just repeating what Cuomo said the other day) gets posted like he’s the perfect person to take over the presidency.

[comment]I love Transformers. You twist them around and they become another thing. We got a Has-bro now and us Bernie-Bros are kicked to the curb like old toys. Yea, we were played. And I don't feel excited by our chances.
Thing is, Bernie was Optimus Prime, Biden is BabbleBee and Trump is a DeceptiCon. 
Bernie started the transfer, talked of rebuilding. And he worked tirelessly for "US". With empathy and integrity.
Biden walks in off of Obama coattails with no inspiration or grassroots following, then expects us to come together now. What a easy ride. It's all vote blue no matter who now. Sure I'll vote for you, but it sure doesn't feel like "US" anymore to me.
[comment]Gee, that's so inspiring. Or something.
[comment]Biden literally is the system.  Trump bad, fine, but Biden was practically born in a committee hearing.  I mean he was elected as a 29 year old and now he’s damn near 80!
[comment]My grandpa who is a conservative Turkish immigrant to the US told me this today " The Democrats build and then the Bush and the Trumps republicans ruin it" I never thought I'd hear something like that from him. He always votes for Erdogan in Turkey who is no different than Trump so I thought he'd support Trump. But like my grandpa always says, vote for the best of the two evils and I guess that is Biden. To the Bernie supporters out there, Bernie was the flame that ignited many feelings and ideas. Survive to thrive another day I guess.
[comment]Transform in what way? I'll fight for Biden over Trump and Democrats all the way down the line, but I have not heard one single transformative idea from Biden besides having a president who not Trump.
[comment]💎JOE🇺🇸
[comment]I'm not super excited but I'll vote for turd sandwich over giant douche with zero reservations.

[comment]Biden wasn’t my first choice but he’ll damn sure get my vote in November.
[comment]Announce bernie as VP so reddit can calm tf down
[comment]This is a Democratic Party sub. The primary is now over. We’re all pouring our resources into helping the Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden win the general election against the Republican incumbent President Donald Trump.

Welcome everyone! Good luck in November!

Edit: Replaced my unhelpful ending
[comment]Blue no matter who.
[comment]Joe should pick AOC as his running mate.  I know they probably don't see eye to eye on a lot, but it would really help bridge the gap with those bernie supporters. Without those bernie bros, he aint winning jack shit.

[comment]Bloomberg would love nothing more than 4 more years of Trump. All of these shitty billionaires do. 

Tax the fuck out of them all.
[comment]He's going to get Bernie elected
[comment]Yep, think about please!!
[comment]never say never...who really thought the idiot in the white house would win?
[comment]As he is a billionaire, Trump winning would only help himself.  I am sure this is just a stunt to just add chaos to the Democratic party.
[comment]Just vote and get everyone you know to vote too.
[comment]Bloombergs goal isn't to elect Trump, but it is to prevent Bernie from being elected. Which is the same as working to elect Trump. Bloomie and the other billionaires are willing to flush the whole country down the tubes rather than pay some taxes.
[comment]The same could be said if Warren and Sanders. Just don’t think their policies are what the majority of Americans want. Biden still stands the best chance to defeat Trump,
[comment]The only spoiler Bloomberg will play is Biden's. He's going to hand the nomination to Sanders or Warren, and then as a desperate attempt to save his own ass he will run as an independent and I'm not so sure a billionaire is going to spoil anything for today's left.
[comment]I think that informing people about Bloomberg's policy positions will actually help Democrats. It would cause disaffected Republicans to vote for Bloomberg. The Democratic party voters have no love for that guy.
[comment]Im pretty sure thats why he entered the election
[comment]Boomerberg running for president just solidifies for me that he prefers Trump over Bernie or Warren because both would make him pay more in taxes.
[comment]I just saw a tv ad for this guy, made it seem like he will house all the homeless and get rid of guns. And he has an image of trump with a very tepid anti-endorsement. This is bad.
[comment]I hate to be a conspiracy theorist but he was on Anderson's cooper a while back and volunteered he had met with Epstien. Anderson didn't even ask. The presidency is the new get of jail free card.
[comment]I am not a fan of Bloomberg at all, but it may be part of the plan. Because let’s be honest, I honestly don’t see a potential democratic candidate that would beat Trump. But it’s still early and a lot can change, only time will tell.
[comment]During this next election, anyone who does not vote for the Democratic nominee, will essentially be voting for Trump - regardless of whether they vote for Trump directly or not.
[comment]This guy needs to stop invoking 9/11 in his obnoxious Youtube ads.  He's acting like Giuliani.
[comment]It's interesting that he doesn't even have to directly support Trump to support Trump. Just by buying up advertisement slots, he can give his side the edge.<|endoftext|>

[comment]They're either very low intelligence, completely out of touch with reality, or have a cruel streak in some way... sometimes all three.
[comment]Who wants to date someone with the emotional intelligence of a 5 year old?
[comment]trumpism is a damn fine indicator of a serious lack of rationality.
[comment]I find it difficult to not punch them in the face. And 3/4 seems low to me. The 1/4 must be the dumbdems that voted for Biden, or would fuck a Repub if he had money.
[comment]I started chatting with one once... second question she asked me was if I supported the orange racist.  Said yes (I don’t)  

Was some of the most awful hatred I’d ever seen anyone text.  Just kept pushing to see how much more I could get out of her.  In then end I actually felt bad for her.  Said Obama was the best president ever and told her to have a great day

The absolute horror texts I got after that were hilarious
[comment]Have you spoken to any of them? Can't imagine having to sit through a couple of hours.
[comment]I think women like bad boys, not stupid boys.
[comment]True story: I dated a trump supporter ONCE, and only because I had never asked him of his political leanings before becoming involved with him. He broke up with me after 3 months because he found out I had a black boyfriend in middle school. 

I am truly stunned there even exists a 25% that would consider dating these people.
[comment]These are rookie numbers people, let's make that one of the first questions we ask from now on.
[comment]Reminds me of the interviews in Behind the Curve documentary about flat earthers where they talk about people dumping them or not going on another date  after finding out they're a flat earther.
[comment]Only three quarters?
[comment]I already get enough racism and xenophobia from my relatives. Don’t need that shit from a SO.
[comment]One-quarter of single Democrats are truly desperate, survey finds.
[comment]And the other quarter think they can fix him or her.
[comment]I mean I’m sure the feeling is mutual.
[comment]Embarrassingly, I dated a rich Trump supporter. I’ll resist sharing details about her, but I will say that I will never make such a mistake again.
[comment]Because who would want to date someone who is bigoted and/or ignorant and/or plain stupid and/or uninformed? There’s a slim chance they’re uninformed and then you can educate them, but that’s rare in my experience.
[comment]Damn right. Can't even picture it.
[comment]Im not attracted to idiots either
[comment]It ends up in unhealthy territory.

You end up feeling like you have to save her.  Or else getting into some dark shit where you're willing to be a slave to her.

The Carver/Matlin thing only exists because neither of them actually believe in anything.
[comment]I don't think I should date at all because physical contact makes me uncomfortable and I like my time to myself too much, but if I did date, I definitely would not date a Trump supporter.  I find it hard to even be friends with Trump supporters.
[comment]I’d fuck one as hard as I could out of spite lmao
[comment]The real question is what percentage of democrats would date someone that didnt vote in 2016. Cause they lowkey voted for Trump too, and will claim up and down that they didnt.
[comment]Ugh! Ex girlfriend was a republican and thought Nixon was framed and given a raw deal. Why I hung in there for the next 6 months baffles me but breaking up was a little bit easier due to a lack of compatibility.
[comment]I stop talking to them when I find out.
[comment]I was looking at the numbers closely and what stands out is that less than college educated democrats were more likely to date a Republican, it would have been nice to see the ages. Possibly younger people just don’t think more about the significance of dating someone with shared interests, it seems to be one of those life lesson things. 

Something else that stood out at me is the number of Democrats who would not date a Hillary Clinton voter, I don’t mean any disrespect but is this the Bernie corner? What caused this?
[comment]Buncha incels
[comment]Very tolerant
[comment]Democrats have morals.
[comment]That’s embarrassing
[comment]I started dating a trump supporter back in April 2018. We are still together, but now he is a registered Democrat and cast his vote for Biden in the primary and plans on doing it again in November. 

Not all Trump supporters are beyond help.
[comment]I'm always torn about things like this as I consider turn-about to be fair play.  


I tell myself that we shouldn't expect or extend fair play rules to literal nazis, but then I worry because I know they view us the same way.  


This situation sucks.
[comment]I’m a liberal currently dating a trump supporter. Can confirm it is very hard to even mention the current state of the world. Love her dearly though.
[comment]They are between the levels of dumb too batshit crazy. Why would someone sane want that?
[comment]Of course. Total red flag.
[comment]I wanted to say that being a Trump supporter is sorta like being an incel, except it's entirely voluntary.
[comment]If this is your biggest concern, then you probably aren’t mature enough for a serious relationship. 

I’m going to go against the flow here, but I’ve noticed that a lot of these comments are from single people, like the survey. It needs to be said: get off reddit, take a break from social media (especially political twitter). Get some fresh air and make some human connections. You’ll find that politics, especially partisan politics, is a lot less important than it seems when you choose to immerse yourself in it 24/7.

[comment]I’m a gay man.  One of my coworkers wanted to set me up with a friend of hers.  She showed me some pics; good-looking guy.  Then she told me he’s a conservative Republican and I was like “no thanks, you can stop there.”  I’ve never understood how anyone LGBT can be politically conservative, especially in the current climate.
[comment]The other 25% are very drunk.
[comment]You guys do know that there is a massive difference between Trump voters and Trump supporters, right? Some people grudgingly voted for him maybe cause they were lifelong Republican's, maybe because they had been fed a lie (MidWest/Rust belt, blue collar workers) about bringing their jobs back, or maybe because they were skeptical of Hillary over the email scandal. While yes, he has his evangelical racist base, not all of his VOTERS are racist. If you dismiss them as racist, how do you guys ever expect to win back those swing states again? Sure, of course there are the too far gonners, but at the same time, there are also those who saw Trump as a way out, a chance to get their jobs back (even though he resultantly didn't ever do that) But seriously, how ignorant are you to not hear the story of a Trump voter before you make your ultimatum?
[comment]I'd be down for one date. Wouldn't mind seeing where we'd go. If he did any moves tho...
[comment]The same democrats who voted biden into the nomination. And don't come with least he's not as bad as trump. It's like offering stage 1 cancer vs stage 3 cancer. Yeah one is worse but its still cancer.
[comment]Dem/progressive women start off calling you an asshole, bigot etc. then when they calm down and you talk for another 20 minutes they end up sucking you off cause you aren’t a sissy boy yes man
[comment]how relevant
[comment]Why would they want to date an 80-year-old anyway?
[comment]It's called natural selection.
[comment]Why would I date someone so hateful and brainwashed?
[comment]Do you honestly think that a trump supporter would even want to date an opinionated, bigoted, purple-haired, pierced woman with poor hygiene??

Really?
[comment]Won’t DATE?! Hell, I won’t even talk to them any more.
[comment]My in laws are on the opposite sides of things and they don't talk about politics.

But, I do have relatives that will outright say if you are a democrat you are a traitor. Those types are hard to relax around because you can't relax around someone that effectively wants you dead.
[comment]Yeah Hot but crazy, been there done that. I'm looking for attractive enough and logical (single forever.)
[comment]I won't even be friends with Trump supporters. I'm cutting ties with all  but the closest family, if they are Trump supporters.
[comment]The other 1/4 are 16 and under. Right? Please?
[comment]Did it once...never again!
[comment]It's hard enough to get along with Trumpified relatives.
[comment]my girlfriend wouldnt, thats why im an “independent”
[comment]Usually blatant stupidity is a turn off so this is not surprising
[comment]This is why in each and every relationship that makes it past the third date mark, I talk politics. And not just "hey the city council wants to fix the local park's swings"....but the big stuff. M4A, Citizen United, abortion, immigration, legalization of marijuana, etc. It may be "assholish" of me, but some beliefs I just can't compromise away.
[comment]I have disowned Trumpers. I would like to see the stats on that.
[comment]I don’t hate Republicans, but I hate Trump supporters with an passion.
[comment]My younger brother voted for Trump. Not because he supported him, but to cancel *my* vote.

I haven't spoken to him in three years.
[comment]That’s because, with Trump supporters, it’s not a difference in political stances. It’s a difference in morality. A compatible relationship requires comparable morals and ethics.
[comment]20 years ago I was a Republican who dated a Democrat. Haven’t voted Republican since the 2000 Primary when my girlfriend convinced me that “even Gore” would better than Bush Jr. 

Sometimes you meet someone hot enough to make you question your values.
[comment]I'd rather have a boil implant at to date a MAGA virus.
[comment]So, you have no compassion and you can't plan long term. Nope.
[comment]But female Trump supporters are easy, and they settle.
[comment]I wouldnt...
[comment]Who the fuck pays for this nonsense? Surveys take a lot of time and money and someone thought this was worth both?
[comment]Not surprised
[comment]Sympatric speciation
[comment]If I was single I'd date a Trump supporter.

I've always wondered what it would be like to be the smartest person in the relationship.
[comment]Just being in the vicinity of a tRump supporter is reprehensible.
[comment]My grandma is a democrat an my grandpa is a trump voter but he’s at least not racist or sexist or homophobic. I bet they have a fun time at the polling booth
[comment]You are essentially saying you'd date someone who is ok being a racist, misogynist who is a pathological liar. Yeah, let's go on a date. Bring your red hat. 1/4 of less crazy people are still crazy.
[comment]Hell no 👎
[comment]Dating mentally challenged people seems problematic
[comment]Can't fix stupid, so why date one?
[comment]What’s wrong with the other 25%?
[comment]Especially now, with the protests it's a good bet they got the Rona.
[comment]I wouldn't even date someone who didn't fully participate in Democratic Party activities and work on campaigns with me.
[comment]If you have to draw the line at political preference, you shouldn’t be dating.

You should have an open mind that isn’t based on who they voted for. 

In my eyes, it’s like an atheist and a Christian: you might not believe the same things, but you don’t have to bring it up all the time, that just leads to arguments. And there are 1000s of times where those relationships worked out.
[comment]Yup, more liberal tolerance and love of diversity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Your vote in November will likely decide who Ruth Bader Ginsburg's successor will be on the Supreme Court. If you want that successor to be a progressive, Biden's the only choice.
[selftext]If DT chooses the next Supreme Court judge, likely she will be a puppet of the president supporting unfair gerrymandering,  election laws and crushing the pro-choice movement.   If we get 4 more  years , there will be no stopping him with full control of the senate,  the Supreme Court and the WH.   Even if Dems hold onto the House, the  Senate and the Supreme Court are much more powerful.  The rise of  totalitarianism in the United States[comment]https://i.redd.it/5mt9d4t7n2s41.png
[comment]Hold me hostage I love it.
[comment]Support the Senate candidates in contested races as well. Biden can prevent another right wing judge but he can’t seat any judges without Senate confirmation. 

McConnell has already shown he’d rather leave those positions vacant than allow any Democratic nominee to be confirmed.
[comment]I do not like biden....but..RBG is the uber important...I will swallow pride and bite my tongue off but no Republicans will get my vote
[comment]No.
[comment]Are democrats calling themselves progressives now?
[comment]The next Supreme Court Justice to be replaced could be could be RBG or Thomas, Alito, or any of them. Be sure we have the best person to choose their successor.
[comment]The Supreme Court has to be secured PERIOD!!!
[comment]I can hear the gun pointed at my head being cocked.
[comment]The Supreme court has been a conservative majority since the 1970s. 

Garland/Gorsuch was the first opportunity in all that time to flip it liberal. 

If Trump gets 4 more years, he will replace 2 more judges (RBG being one, and most likely Thomas), but also probably Breyer. 

Having a 6-3 conservative majority, filled to the brim with young judges, is an absolute disaster. 

If you want ANY, and I mean ANY of your liberal ideals to survive a court challenge in the next 30 years, bite your tongue, swallow your pride, and vote Biden. 

Vote Biden, because he isn't Trump. And removing Trump from office is of a HUGE importance.

Also, make no mistake. There is a mile of difference in policy between Biden and Trump, even if Biden isn't as liberal as you want him to be.
[comment]Let RBG retire already!!!!
[comment]The DNC/Biden better start finding ways to earn independent/swing votes then. If they can't do this, it's not the voter's fault they failed to expand their base. 

They need to start figuring out how to appeal to young voters and to Bernie's supporters. Polls are saying that Biden/Trump are tied at 44% of young voters, how is that even possible that they're tired? I get it that a lot of young voters don't vote but a good size does, those need a reason to vote Democrat/Biden.

Also, I see a lot of blame coming from all sides, but we have to remember that the only power or voice the people have is their vote. However you choose to see it, whether it's not voting or always voting red/blue you're wasting your vote if you're not voting for a person that's speaking to your concerns then you're wasting your only voice if you're simply falling in line. This concept can't be changed.

You can't expect people to vote for your values. People need to find their own values to vote for, that's the whole point of having your own vote to cast. If you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is saying that Biden isn't speaking to their concerns, why would I vote for him? Then tell them "What about the SCOTUS??, there are other more important things than your concerns"...

You're basically telling these people their main concerns don't matter. Imagine being told that your concern over the SCOTUS doesn't matter because surviving day to day matters more? How would you react to that? We can't guilt or force people to prioritize each other's own personal values. To you, the SCOTUS matters the most and to others, the basic necessities matter the most. 

So pitting people against each other saying that this matters more isn't going to work or speak to the voters you need.
[comment]The next president (be that Biden or a second term for Trump) will likely appoint anywhere from 1-4 justices:

* RBG (89, liberal bloc, Clinton appointee)
* Breyer (81, liberal bloc, Clinton appointee)
* Thomas (71, conservative bloc, H.W. Bush appointee)
* Alito (70, conservative bloc, W. Bush appointee)

If we win the WH and the Senate, we will, at a minimum, ensure that the current balance of the Court remains only a narrow 5-4 conservative majority, with the *possibility* of flipping the Court to a 6-3 liberal majority if Thomas and Alito also retire and/or die during the next 4 years.

If Trump and the GOP maintain power, then the Court will be lost for a generation, with a high likelihood of an 7-2 conservative majority (plus Thomas and Alito would likely be pressured to retire to be replaced with younger conservatives to lock in their majority even longer).

We can’t let that happen.
[comment]Biden is extremely electable, and Trump is so hated that he’s *definitely* going to lose—or at least that’s what the DNC has been telling us. 

I trust them, so I know I’m safe to vote my conscience on Election Day, so that my voice can be heard of even in some small way.
[comment]So, why would the Democratic Party start a civil war on their own side? Weird strategy if there is an existential threat.
[comment]The Supreme Court is already conservative and joe Biden is also a conservative. Who cares, the fight is long, don’t vote for the democrats hostage plan. They will never learn, so they must be destroyed.
[comment]Thank you. I’ve been trying to tell some of the Bernie bro children this, but apparently I’m “pathetic with no morality”.
[comment]1. RBG needs to survive until Inauguration day
2. Lets hope the Donald doesn't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay or even cancel the general election.
[comment]He isn't the only choice. Biden can step down and a more viable candidate chosen at the convention. A lot of Bernie supporters are independent and Republicans mad at Trump. Biden absolutely can not get any of their votes. Trumps campaign is already bringing up bidens dixiecrat roots.

Democrats kept saying Bernie couldn't build a coalition, but Biden can't get independents, 3rd parties, and Republicans to flip. Trump is guaranteed to win with democrats running Biden and having attacked Bernie so much. If it's bloomberg Biden Clinton, Trump wins hands down. This time both the college and popular vote. Woman are going to abandon the democrats once all the biden kid touching and rape allegations start to come out.
[comment]Only if we also win the senate.

Otherwise, the Turtle will block a blue nominee for eight years if he must.
[comment]The DNC is counting on people falling in line with its candidate choice. 

Like our corporate CEOs should be learning right now (but they aren’t, thanks to bailouts) if you risk big you can lose big
[comment]Wasn’t Obama’s pick Merrick Garland... and wasn’t he conservative? And what about the Anita Hill situation?
[comment]Tried that argument in 2016 when three judges were in play (well done RBG for hanging in there for us) but the Bernie fundamentalists would have nothing of it. I came to the conclusion that most of them wouldn't have voted anyway which was somewhat confirmed in the primaries. All principles no action. 

My take - it's far easier to change from a position of power when you don't have a boot on your neck and a baton beating your balls (or whatever if you don't have them). Unless of course you prefer a bloody revolution and I see zero evidence that more than a tiny handful of Biden refuseniks are into that. You can't have a revolution by just liking social media posts really enthusiastically.
[comment]Biden voted for Scalia
[comment]Should have retired literally anytime between 08-16. Hubris got us in this mess.
[comment]Not without Senate. Not voting for Biden.
[comment]buh Biden needs to EARN muh vote!

nah but seriously Trump will nominate a 55 year old hyper-conservative to replace RBG, a 55 year old hyper-conservative to replace Breyer, and to spice things up, a 50 year old hyper-conservative to replace Thomas.
[comment]No 🙏
[comment]Yeah, uh.....no, no this is the "Establishment's. " failure to provide an "electable " candidate,  not to mention more of the same tired neoliberal policies and bullshit incremental change strategy to please your Wallstreet masters,  when t-rump beats your Republican lite candidate the only ones to blame are the DNC corporate whores, so yeah, go ahead and gaslight everyone and blame the voters , just like last time

[comment]His base love it. They believe this is what makes him a  "badass".
[comment]He’s not leading us into war because someone got under his skin. He’s leading us into war because it’s part of his re-election campaign.

Don’t you think there are bigger things at this point?
[comment]Who is this aimed at on r/Democrats?
[comment]Hillary will always be the winner. But deposed by an R coup, the standing for Republicans and Russia.
[comment]Absofuckinglutly this shit is on whoever voted for the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpf, that means the right wing nut bags and the stupid ass Democrats that wanted something different or didn't like Hillary,it doesn't matter who runs as a Democrat, whether you like that person or not YOU STILL VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRAT YOU BUNCH OF SELLOUTS!! now look what the alternative got us and is going to get us into!! Are you all going to pull that same bullshit if you don't like the Democratic nominee this year or are you going to come to your senses and stick with the party I hope it's the latter that you stick with the fucking party.
[comment]... every Bernie Supporter: *Doubt*
[comment]I must have used the word "stupid" to how people voted against Hillary and either for Trump, for a third party, or voted not at all.  I have stopped but really really hope that they vote more strategically in this election even if they can't stand Biden or whomever.  We need a Democratic ADMINISTRATION which, in case you didn't know, is thousands of people not just the one President.  I didn't even mention Supreme Court Justices.
[comment]PSST: she won the election

Finding wedges to drive between each other is doing Putin's work for him.
[comment]I don’t think this is a fair assessment AT ALL. Don’t get my wrong: Trump is one of the worst if not THE WORST president we’ve ever had. I would never in a million years vote for him and I will be happy when he is out of office. But to say that a war with Iran would be the fault of everyone that voted for him (1) absolves the Trump administration of responsibility and (2) doesn’t take into account how broken the political system in the US is and why Trump was elected in the first place.
[comment]Lol

<|startoftext|>[title]The Nightmare Scenario: Trump Loses in 2020 and Refuses to Concede - Kentucky governor's baseless voter fraud claims have experts worried Trump will do the same.
[selftext]https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nv98/the-nightmare-scenario-trump-loses-in-2020-and-refuses-to-concede[comment]Hopefully he won't make it to 2020
[comment]I can't imagine he will lose in 2020. I will be voting for him even though I am a registered Democrat. The Democratic candidates are weak this time and damn near incompetent.
[comment]Oh, I'm sure he'll refuse to concede if he loses in 2020.
[comment]He already said he wouldn’t accept a losing result  during a debate with Hillary.
[comment]My nightmare is that he is impeached, removed from office and then actually voted back into office....
[comment]Ok, and? What is going to be done about it? How are we preparing? We already know this will happen. The days of peaceful transitions of power in this country are over. This guy gets away with so much, that I’m pretty sure he could just refuse to leave and stay in The White House for as long as he likes. Especially if Dems don’t take the Senate and keep the House. That’s the real nightmare scenario.
[comment]The nightmare is him getting reelected.
[comment]he was already refusing to accept defeat in 2016 before he realized that he'd succeeded in stealing the election.  so we need to prepare for 2020 for sure.
[comment]I will certainly admit that Trump is different, but there have been serious, though partisan, concerns about every President not relinquishing the office going back at least to Clinton. Of course when the time comes, the look on their face is mostly relief.
[comment]I am fully expecting that to happen.

He's gonna call in the people that have been stocking guns to siege Washington. 

We are going to see how patriotic they really are.
[comment]pretty likely scenario we need to prepare for in advance
[comment]Trump is going to prison if he loses. He will do this and more.
[comment]I wouldn't mind voting against him twice. I'm pretty sure he would lose by a wider margin in a second vote.
[comment]Fortunately, he doesn’t have to concede. Conceding or not has no legal meaning. What’s happening in Kentucky is not a question of unwillingness to concede, but rather the legislature’s willingness to consider using the Kentucky constitution to subvert the election.

That’s not to say that Faux Nooz and the Trumpies won’t find a way to make up some bullshit argument about how he won the election even though he lost.

I would think the nightmare scenario would be him winning the popular vote and losing the electoral. Then suddenly he would claim it is time to retroactively invalidate the electoral college. Who knows what this Supreme Court would do with that.
[comment]Handcuffs. That's what will happen. Trump in handcuffs
[comment]He claimed there was voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election.... Spoiler alert, he won.
[comment]Although this is a very real possibility. I want to believe that considering Republicans in office won't be so caught up in tying themselves to someone who will (almost certainly) have been impeached and lost reelection.

They can make a clean break from Trump and not be held hostage anymore but an impulsive divisive President. What we've seen lately is hitching your wagon to the Trump train is not the best way to win elections. 

I think we know most Republican senators don't like Trump and can see a way out without having to speak out against him. They can talk about how the peaceful transition and elections have consequences.

I'm an optimist and idealist so I tend to believe the best in people so that my.color my views but I'm hopeful.
[comment]He would need to take complete control of the military, FBI and CIA to do this.  Pretty impossible.  A more likely scenario is that he does a bunch sabotage like shit as a FU to the country.
[comment]Presumes he makes it to the next election. 

The real nightmare scenario is we get to November 2020 and the Republicans have no candidate.
[comment]Hopefully 2020 will be such a bloeout their will be no argument, but that's a dream world
[comment]Concession is not a legal process. It doesn't matter if he doesn't concede. What matters is if he doesn't leave the White House
[comment]There is no basis for believing this would happen. The second the president elect is sworn in, anyone not in his or her administration will be removed from the White House by Capitol Hill police and/or the secret service.
[comment]I'd say the real nightmare is Trump winning... But yes, i can totally imagine him refusing to concede , especially if the result is at all close. His supporters live in an alternate reality and will believe any crazy shit he says about a stolen election. Could get very ugly.

I hope he is defeated by such a huge margin that there's no way for him to go down this path. This should be the goal. Complete annilhation of Trumpism.
[comment]well, someone be ready to physically remove him or designate a new Whitehouse and ignore everything he says or does.
[comment]Then the next president will have him dragged away. Looking forward to it.
[comment]Like anything else, this takes preparation. Talk to your friends and family and local politics organizers about this possibility in advance, such that if he pulls such as stunt, we immediately have people in the streets in DC and every state capitol.
[comment]Won't work. He will squeal as he is dragged to the curb, no doubt. I just hope his cult followers don't take anyone with them.
[comment]Who cares if he refuses to concede? Like it or not if he loses he will no longer be president, it doesn't matter how he feels about it
[comment]There's a straightjacket with his name on it if he even tries!
[comment]Russia will see to it that he prevails.  He will once again carry a number of key swing states by relatively small margins.  He will lose the popular vote \[again\] and win the electoral votes and the presidency.  

Russian hackers will once again throw the election in Trump's favor.
[comment]We should pass voter ID laws so he doesn’t have an excuse
[comment]Secret service will remove him and new president will be sworn in.
[comment]Fuck that notion. If he loses and refuses to call cede, then there will be a whole host of secret service agents more than willing to take him out of the White House. This is a country FOUNDED upon checks and balances.

We don’t let a despot to control the narrative.
[comment]Expect it. Unless it's a landslide victory for us, he's going to dispute it, the closer it is, the closer it could go to a supreme court vote.  Hopefully we can convince everyone who wants him out to swarm the polls in November of 2020.
[comment]If all the Democrats in America voted in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have won in a landslide. 

GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO VOTE!
[comment]Honestly, people seem to be thinking were gonna be having a civil war over this. If Trump refuses to leave then he just gets arrested or legally taken out and were fine. Historically there has been way worse complications and divisions during an election. The election of 1800 was the first time power changed sides in the US and people thought then there would be civil war, but there wasn't because they didn't want to destroy America. We aren't going to have a civil war over this because everyone who believes in our country and what it stands for will follow what happens in the election.
[comment]&gt;Feaver said Trump’s rhetoric is at the very least “deeply irresponsible"

That's the understatement of the century.
[comment]A narrow loss guarantees this outcome
[comment]Chaos is Trumps middle name (well that and Donald)
[comment]I have no doubt that when Trump looses that is exactly what he will do.

The bigger question is what will his lackeys do ?

Will they follow him down that rabbit hole or finally grow a spine and honor their oath to uphold the constitution ?

[comment]If Dems didnt win the house we'd all either be speaking Russian or locked in a gulag.
[comment]It is good that Hillary is giving credit to the activists. I have to give her credit for that. Obama has been going around shaming and patronizing our activists recently. Hopefully, more people unite around the base.
[comment]Hillary Great statement... However each time I see her my heart skips a beat and I think please don't run...
[comment]What's this dude talking about?
[comment]And now the candidates know to not call voters names. Ideally, the next Democratic candidate will know this too. Staying snug and cushioned in your little echo chamber can really, really make you lose track of reality. You're helping out FOX when you're being dumb enough to call Trump supporters (sensible candidates call them voters) names.

[comment]I wonder if he says the same thing about fighter jets and bombs???
[comment]Correct, you don't need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.. **You need more.**
[comment]He seems happy to downplay Coronavirus but watch his attitude suddenly change when he cancels the election on health and safety grounds.

[comment]He does know this all ends with he and his offspring in line to the gallows, right?
[comment]Try not to link to Fo卐 News.

This puppet dictator's bullshit is pretty standard at this point.
[comment]He just tweeted in all caps that ford needs to open a plant in Ohio and make ventilators...

It’s almost like crazy people have a hard time making up their minds.
[comment]Why is this petulant child still president? Seriously, as one of his cabinet what could you possibly have to gain by keeping him in office? 

The 25th amendment has been talked about to death, but regardless of how *likely* it is, the fact is it's plausible. 

Under the amendment's fourth stipulation, it would only take 14 people to depose the president — Vice President Mike Pence and 13 of Trump's 24 cabinet members.

Section IV reads:
"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President."

So what do these people think they're getting out of supporting him that they wouldn't get under Pence - and with significantly less baggage. Monumentally less baggage. They could get everything they have now, *and* Pence would go up against Biden and have a better shot at winning than Trump, so they'd be giving their odds of tenure a much better chance. 

What the hell is it that's keeping them supporting this man who daily, hourly gives them such grief? In three years and three months I have yet to hear an explanation for the GOP's sycophancy that stands up to scrutiny.

[comment]Let us look at two different scenarios. First, you have more ventilators than you need which means you spend more money than you need but a lot fewer people die than you expected. Second, you have fewer ventilator than you need, which means you get to play God and decide who lives and who dies.

Why? Because he knows he can blame us for the failures of his managment and take credit for the success once it's over. Brazen deceit has become a literal tactic.

<|startoftext|>[title]Sen. Murphy (D): Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That’s not a question. The question is this - as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?
[selftext]https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1212913952436445185[comment]That's exactly what Trump did. This will create a few, unnecessary jobs and rake in a few more campaign contributions to Republicans from companies within the Military-Industrial Complex. The reasons to impeach this asshat continue to build.
[comment] [https://i.imgur.com/GfE3TcZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/GfE3TcZ.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

Trump cries that Obama needs Congressional approval before air strikes.
[comment]Shut the fuck up. Nobody cares about congressional approval.

We just started a war by assassinating a top general. With or without congressional approval, we are the bad guys. This war is evil, and we should appose it on those grounds because literally nobody cares about congressional approval. The only reason congressional approval should even be mentioned is if we are arguing that congress would not have approved the action.
[comment]Isn’t this the distraction Trump wants, to get everyone off thinking about impeachment? Seems perfect to me.
[comment]Fuck Trump.
[comment]I’m afraid this isn’t going to be regional at all. As a result of this strike there will be attacks in the US.
[comment]I'll go out on a limb and predict that Trump properties will be early targets of retaliation.
[comment]Trump knew what he was doing. That's why he didn't tell Congress:

"A war between the United States and Iran would be a disaster. Even worse than the disaster after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Neither side can reasonably be interested in a military conflict. And yet both are currently in the process of escalating the conflict."  6 months ago during Strait of Hormuz escalation

[comment]Didn’t they say the Generals were going to stop Trump from doing something like this because they wouldn’t follow an illegal order? Isn’t assassination illegal?
[comment]Don't forget when we secured the Baghdad airport and risked lives to do so? Now its so unsecure that Iran Generals use it to attack us? You can't look at this as just an attack, have we lost Iraq? Time to come home.
[comment]Not only is a war convenient for Trump. One talking point I haven't heard talked about though relates to Trump/Republicans' BFF in the middle East. A particular guy/country who has a vested interest in killing Soleimani and potentially crippling Iran, but doesn't have the means to do it himself.
[comment]Congress should cut off all funding to the military.
[comment]Does anyone know, was Soleimani in Iraq legally? That would be an important factor in whether this was an assassination from a legal point of view.
[comment]And we are all still waiting ( after reading posts ) for some entity of authority within our government to actually enforce the law.
And, yeah this moronic clown and company DID just assassinate Soleimani . Fucking treacherous regime running the country...
[comment]You need to get Congress permission to declare war. And the guy was a terrorist. I’m not mourning his death and there are a lot of Iran People who are happy he is dead. So no this is not declaration of war so he did not need congress.<|endoftext|>

The son of supreme Court Justice Kennedy was the banker.

[comment]Is this the impeached and disgraced President Trump being referenced in the report?
[comment]This is like the second or third explosive report as of late. 

So many explosions. 

Is everyone ok?
[comment]Not really explosive in the sense that Russia in some way incentivized lending to Trump who in turn laundered Russian money. Probably did more than that tbh.

 But the new piece to the puzzle was the incentive to DB was a guarantee from VTB? Or was the news the fact that a guarantee from VTB was the equivalent of a guarantee from Putin? 

I keep saying, with Trump all roads lead to money.

[comment]Hey look! More evidence nobody’s gonna do anything about. So explosive.
[comment]To be sure, there is no doubt in my mind that DT is a kompromat under Putin's thumb but Forensic News? That site is sketchy and Kos should know better than to hitch their wagon to it.

You can tell they are from their expression as if they have a bottle of hand sanitiser waiting after shaking hands with their Democrat supporters.

They always look bored as if they would just "phone it in". No genuine smiles, bare minimum of brand.

Seriously I don't trust them.

Infiltrate. Disseminate. Eliminate. That's the Republican method; sway the states, distract the votes, race to the lead.

They're wingers for the other side.
[comment]I really don't want Trump Stresianding Bloomberg into a contender though.

[comment]Good on that governor.
[comment]Firing them was absolutely the right thing to do.

My only question is why the newspaper is pixelating their faces.   This is an official class photo they posed for and knew could be  displayed.  Show us their faces and let this follow them around when  they are seeking future employment.  I'd hate to think these people  could go out and apply for other corrections or law enforcement work and  potentially be trained and hired because they left this off their  resume.  No one who does something like this should ever be in position  where they carry a gun, a tazer, or a club and have lawful authority  over anyone.
[comment]Good.
[comment]The comments section has been essentially hijacked by people who rather talk about the Stanford  experiment,

which has absolutely no bearing AT ALL regarding the photo OR the West Virginia Correctional Officer class,

or the fact that they have been correctly fired after casually, stupidly, gleefully displaying Neo-Nazi salutes.

No one is offering the phony argument that the symbol began as a prank on 4chan to "own the libs",

which is fine; in reality since real White Supremacists and real racist mass murderers have been photographed, 

and caught on video, publicly using the sign, then if it DID begin as a prank, well, the morons played them selves.

&amp;#x200B;

So, are all of these students White Supremacists?

Probably NOT; SOME are, the instigators are,

but some of them very likely just followed along, caught in the moment of seeming camaraderie.

Were ANY of them making cognizant, correct choices as future correctional officers?

NO.  Absolutely NOT.  

They deserved to be fired for this, and they were.

[selftext]https://www.ibtimes.com/donald-trump-accused-genocide-letting-americans-die-betraying-us-2948388[comment]Obviously Fuck Trump... But this isn't genocide and it's irresponsible to try to say it is. Genocide is a systematic intentional action to remove a specific group from existence. Genocide is 8,000 Tutsis dying per day for 100 days. Genocide is Saddam Hussain gassing the Kurds. 


Trump is criminally negligent, and unbelievably petty, but he isn't organized enough to commit genocide.
[comment]I really hope Trump lives long enough to see what a fool history will show him to be. Corona virus will be in every history book. History will not be kind to Trump.
[comment]"Netizens", huh? Seems pretty serious..
[comment]I'd call it gross incompetence, not genocide.
[comment]What happened to the Jews is a Genocide. Rwanda, Genocide. Stupidity and poor decision making is one thing. With respect to the people that actually were killed for just being what they were, let’s find a better word than Genocide.
[comment]I think the descendants of Armenians who’ve been systemically killed by the Turks 100+ years would beg to differ.
[comment]Definitely not genocide. That’s not what happened, he didn’t commit biological warfare. He’s just incompetent.
[comment]We as Americans let that man be in office
[comment]This is a bullshit source stating an exaggerated version of the obvious to both increase its own status and discredit us.

Republicans kill lots of people by deliberate sabotage, all the time.  It's their agenda.  But it's not genocide, it's just sociopathy.
[comment]lol this OP literally doesn't understand the word "genocide"
[comment]Well, of course, it isn't genocide. that is just on a ridiculous level and although he's been bad, genocide is an entirely different universe. what I can say is that he is incompetent and has done a terrible job handling this crisis. his lack of leadership has resulted in chaos around the country and he could have done a much better job.
[comment]People love throwing big words around. As much as I despise trump he is just irresponsible and not fit to be president.
[comment]I get that trump has had a terrible response, but i have found it hard to come by concrete things(like, to use in an argument) that he has done/ not done that has made this epidemic worse. can anyone name anything in specific?
[comment]Genocide? That’s not the right word. Gross negligence is one of the words. It could be in the territory of some form of manslaughter although I only saw one (🙏) of those press conferences and that is the one where he said”what have you got to lose”. 

I think he was self aware enough to mention checking with your doctor which , if true, would get him off the hook.

But have no doubt, his gross negligence in this crisis has killed many and demolished an economy. We’re nowhere near the end.
[comment]Remember when back in like 2012 or something, Trump wanted Obama out of office because of 3 deaths of Ebola in the US... shouldn’t that be the same for him with a hell of a lot more than 3. (I don’t keep up with the corona stuff, idk how many deaths there were)
[comment]Jesus Christ

This is by far the winner for gross over exaggeration and shitty journalism I’ve seen over Donald trump
[comment]After the failed impeachment, it's now ok for the President to withhold funds and allow people to die if they don't help him out personally. I don't think its titled genocide maybe its just premeditated murder.

[comment]My God Bloomberg is so out of touch... I haven't followed him at all except the occasional Reddit comment and meme. 

He's running satirically right? Like he's gonna reveal in a month that it's all been an act? He's trying to teach voters that Donald trump can happen to the left? And we need to be careful?

I really thought it was hyperbole calling him the lefts Donald trump. You can feel the audience holding back boos when he was talking about his tax returns. My God.
[comment]Not a single viable candidate.
[comment]I like Biden. He's definitely not my favorite candidate, but I wouldn't have a problem with his nomination. But damn his speaking skills are the worst of these candidates. You can hear his age and it's really disappointing watching him stutter and unable to keep up with his own thoughts.
[comment]Is it just me.. or does it feel nearly IMPOSSIBLE to watch the democratic debates at your own pace??

I was at work when the debate started. Finding it impossible to watch from the beginning. Hell, I just paused it to put in my laundry and it JUMPED right to LIVE. 

This public information should be much much easier to find for voters. I feel like every single debate has been unnecessarily difficult to find. 

Can't rewatch it without some pundit's take or chopped up "highlight reel". 

Please someone correct me if I am wrong :-( but I have been pulling my hair out this year just trying to be informed.. and that feels so so wrong.

(sorry to rant).
[comment]I think Warren is taking a lead tonight. Good for her
[comment]This was a rough debate to watch. I think it will get more palatable once we narrow down the field. I didn’t get the presidential vibes from any candidate tonight but then again the bar has been set the lowest in our history as a nation.

[comment]Do we think any of the candidates on that stage would tab one of the others as their running mate when all is said and done? I’m having trouble thinking of a logical pairing.
[comment]Does anyone else wish these debates actually involved civil discourse instead of what feels like reality tv drama? I feel like they have to act that way because of the way the debate is structured, but it would be nice to just hear policy discussion without constant interruption or eye rolling from the other candidates.
[comment]You all saw strategy being worked tonight. Warren is in the 10-12% range and sees Bloomberg sitting at 19% (simply by spending). She went big game hunting tonight to try and pry some of that 19% into her camp. She likely succeeded, as Bloomberg came off as unprepared and disinterested. Mayor Pete at 15% went after Klobuchar's 7%, assuming he could get himself into the 20% range. 

Biden seems to be comfortable just ploughing along on his record as though anyone cares what he did 20+ years ago vs. what he'll do in 2021. 

Bernie is ... well, he's Bernie. He's divisive. You either love that crazy revolutionary hand-waving or you want to join the cops from the 60's dragging his ass to the pokey. The biggest problem with Bernie is that I actually agree with Bloomberg (which is gross): if Bernie is the candidate, he won't beat Trump. There's too much crazy there for him to pull the voters off their couches in November. (I realize this is a super unpopular opinion on reddit.)

Bottom line: tonight was about Warren and Mayor Pete trying to make this a smaller race by pulling a "This is Sparta!" to Bloomberg and Amy.
[comment]Disappointed at the lack of talk on policy, glad Bernie was the only person to give numbers regarding his universal healthcare plan rather than platitudes. That new study showing the $450b savings is a huge plus for him that needs to be argued, Pete was STUMPED at that response and could only fallback on a petty defense of himself, very telling moment on who has the most nuance behind their policy.
[comment]Bloomberg actually did alright
[comment]Am I crazy or is Bloomberg making a lot of sense to me? I mean initially didn’t look good when he got hanged up on but afterwards I’m really liking him. Also liking Amy Klobuchar

Maybe he should have tried expanding his base a little instead of spending the last three years just giving the middle finger to the 62 percent of the country that DIDN'T vote for him.

GOTV

Does Arizona really hate Martha mcsally/Trump that much?
[comment]Arizonan here.  We must NOT become complacent.  We must turn out in record numbers and vote for Mark as if he was 5 points behind.

[comment]Mark Kelly is a national hero. He's an engineer, naval pilot and an astronaut with countless medals to his name.

So no wonder he's leading Senatorial campaign contributions. His individual contributions are at $2.8 million while McSally's are at $1.9 million. Mark Kelly is outraising Martha McSally across the board, but he’s also picking up more individual contributions from unexpected areas, like some suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, where Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

[comment]Depressing part: still a huge chunk of America lived through the past 4 years and went "more!"
[comment]Cool. VOTE!
[comment]Just heard Joe Biden is leading what is called the haters group by 40% meaning the voters that didn't like Hillary Clinton for whatever reason and didn't like Donald j drumpf, we all know the reasons why they didn't like him.
[comment]FLIP
[comment]C’mon Kelly! I want to see this man in the Senate! 

Can’t wait, he would make for a great Senator.
[comment]Polling in Arizona is decidedly sparse, with the PI poll being the only one in May. But aggregating polls from February on, Kelly still has a 9 point lead. Only the two oldest polls show even a small McSally lead.

I think Arizona will end up going the same way on Trump and McSally. Right now, it looks like they will lose "bigly."
[comment]Bye Falicia
[comment]Got to give them both props for the hard work they’re doing. We can’t relax but these are nice leads.
[comment]It would be great if AZ turned blue.  I'm counting on Michigan and Pennsylvania though.  I've written off Florida, too many crazy folks down there.
[comment]This poll doesn't weigh by education and is more Dem-friendly than most polls. Also has Biden up 7.

[Polling average still has Biden up 4 though](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/Arizona.html) and [Kelly up 9](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/az/arizona_senate_mcsally_vs_kelly-6801.html). 

Plenty of time left in this ballgame.
[comment]As a note, the pollster (OH Predictive Insights) has a B/C rating from 538 ("average initial results") and typically slightly overstates Republican performance (&lt;1 point).
[comment]I’m newly registered to vote in Arizona and will proudly be voting Democrat down the ballot. I’m ready to get these scumbags out of office.
[comment]I'm sorry I miss quoted, the haters group are people that didn't vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald j drumpf, but 40% of them said they will vote for Joe Biden.
[comment]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/politics/voters-biden-trump-2020-analysis/index.html
[comment]I'm from CA, currently registered in TX but thinking of heading to AZ to make my blue vote count more. Glad to help.
[comment]I don’t trust Mark Kelly. If he’s elected we’ll never know whether it’s he or Scott that is governing that day. Like Christian Bale in The Prestige.

/s
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.
[comment]The 50 marker is really important here, and something that's very positive to see at this point in the race.
[comment]Assume the opposite, vote, get people registered to vote, get them out to vote, don’t leave anything on the field.
[comment]Can't wait to see the McCains come to an Arizona Biden rally preaching bipartisanship!  If there are any campaign rallies
[comment]Jesus's saggy left testicle that woman's face just screams "Karen" from a mile away.
[comment]woo go democrats!!!
[comment]A poster wrote for some reason a lot of people in the country hated Hillary most of the people that hated Hillary was the right, and they were so fucking wrong because look what we have now and look what it's gotten us into. Whether you liked Hillary Clinton or hated Hillary Clinton that WOMAN would have been such a step up from the deranged lunatic we have now it's not even close, if she's not the most accomplished woman in politics history then she's in the top five. All the right-wing does is throw shit at the left to see if it sticks and that's exactly what those right-wing trolls are going to do with Joe Biden and that's why we need every Democrat, Republican, independent oh wait and every idiot Democrat that voted for this deranged lunatic to come together to vote the orangutan out of office in 2020 so please, everyone get out there and vote or make sure to mail in your ballot for Joe Biden and Democrats down the board, let's show these right-wing trolls what a real blue Wave is on November 3rd. and continue to stay safe.

[comment]He may embarrass GOP women but he sickens the rest of us.
[comment]Question is, why is he only embarrassing to women? I think there’s a hidden message here about South Carolina women being the smartest between the two sexes.

[comment]Do not underestimate the power of soccer moms in the suburbs. They are a large group that is very active.
[comment]lol ok
[comment]Can we start calling him Leningrad Lindsey? Can we make that a thing?
[comment]I have a cousin who lives in SC. He posts anti-Trump/Graham/GOP stuff on Facebook. The replies from SC supporters are a shitshow of conservative lies and propaganda. Including women. The South is a lost cause.
[comment]/r/trumpgret
[comment]I wish to God that John McCain was still alive! I don't think Lindsey would dare pull this Trump-enabling shit if he was.
[comment]It would probably be the best thing for everyone if he lost the next election.  The senate gets rid of Lindsey and he can finally come out of the closet...
[comment]They should be embarrassed. He’s a disgrace.
[comment]He does given women from South Carolina a bad name.
[comment]*according to another politician
[comment]So you mean.... the pussy grabbing, thrice married, cheats on all of his wives, and walks into teen pageant dressing rooms president ....wasnt enough?

I honestly dont understand how any women can align with the GOP anymore.
[comment]Waiting for him to say “women of South Carolina, don’t abandon me! I suck dick just like you do.”
[comment]I just have one thing to say:
WELCOME LADIES: 
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
BUT MY GOSH WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? I bet if a man treated YOU the way this dirtbag treated women you wouldn't have stayed as long as you did with the man, at least I would hope you wouldn't have, because no woman deserves to be treated the way he treats women. As a matter of fact no person deserves to be treated the way he treats people. I can't believe I'm saying this about a president of our great country but then again, he's not a president at least not mine, he's a wannabe dictator and his name is Donald drumpf!!
[comment]My prior post was meant for a different headline but other than that welcome ladies, Lindsey Graham is no better than Donald j drumpf, he's a liar and the follower of the dear leader. Lindsey Graham will do whatever it takes for him to get a vote or do whatever it takes for him to be put into the drumph dictatorship. So ladies if your husband, boyfriend or girlfriendsl, aren't already on your side and voting against Lindsey Graham you know what to do to make them get on your side and vote with you, take it from a guy you know what to do ladies. hahahaha
[comment]The need to. One against Leningrad Lindsey
[comment]So they finally realized that he is gay?
[comment]Never underestimate the power of ignorance,cheating, intimidation and racism. I'll believe it when he's voted out of office only when I see it.
[comment]No offense but I'll believe that when I see it. White Southern women are super duper hung up on abortion.

I know moms with disabled kids who are like "I know my kid has preexisting conditions and is on Medicaid that Republicans want to cut but I gotta save da babies!"
[comment]Something is up with Graham Cracker. I smell another rat... If these republicans want to live in a Russia. Go there. Leave the USA to a democracy  🇺🇸
[comment]All due respect to Rep. Clyburn, but this is basically an anecdote. Him talking to one or two women who identify as Republicans who have expressed dissatisfaction with Graham and his Trump sycophancy, should not be taken to mean that this is happening on a large scale, as indicated by the word "flocking". Actual polls show that over 90% of Republicans, men and women strongly support Trump, and anyone who defends him.
[comment]Lindsay so nothing Graham... Has gotta go
[comment]The entire United States of America should be embarrassed by Lindsey.
[comment]'Bout time!!
[comment]People forget that Graham urged John McCain to turn over the Steele Dossier to the FBI in the first place.  So you could say Lindsey Graham is in the deep state and started the Russia investigation.
[comment]She is a horrible example for the women of South Carolina!<|endoftext|>

[comment]How is this not an offense worthy of incarceration. Should literally be jailed for this.
[comment]It's fine, let him literally waste his own time and the time of his fellow Republicans. The next Dem senate will just pass them when they get in.
[comment]There shouldn't be any way for one person to stop a vote in the senate...for either party.
[comment]We need to literally have laws passed to make what he is doing a felony offense.

It's fine if the votes aren't there to pass the bills. That's how it goes. But to table legislation voted on and passed is a violation of his oath of office. 

One man should not have the power to shut down the legislative branch. In other countries violence would break out over shit like this, yet here we just allow it.
[comment]How many of those has he actually read?
[comment]How many bills are sitting in the house from the senate?
[comment]Wasn't one of the main arguments in the Senate and by Trump's defense was how the trial would prevent the Senate from getting work done?

Na it's okay, just sit on those bills. When you're out of office and the Senate changes majority they'll get looked at properly.
[comment]"We're  not going to even vote on those." FTFY you unamerican POS turtle.
[comment]If they just sit, can a new senate hear and vote on them?
[comment]Guys, don't blame him! It's not his fault turtles are slow.
[comment]WTF? They aren’t even earning a paycheck! At least read the Bills and render a decision you lazy, worthless old people.

Hey MAGA’s, your tax dollars are just swirling down the drain. At least I can say the Dems are showing up, working and earning their paycheck, which is more than you can say.
[comment]But yet he is still getting a paycheck....
[comment]This guy is such a fucking cock.
[comment]Historically less than 8% of all bills even get voted on. This isn't news its just how the process works.
[comment]Can’t cancer or heart disease help us out with this POS Turtle?

[comment]This fool has done so much damage to this country. There's no way a senator from one state should have so much power. He does not represent the vast majority of us. We have no vote over him.
[comment]There is someone running against him.  I think her name is McGrath.
[comment]Don’t just place the blame on him. If the rest of the Republicans in the Senate disagreed with his actions, they could remove him as Speaker, and they haven’t.  If Trump disagreed, he would’ve pressured him to step down.  He is the face of a systemic problem with Republican leadership.
[comment]lol Cocaine Mitch is something else, isn't he?
[comment]Have they considered taking a few those bills back and amending them to add some pro-Putin and Pro-Russia sections?  They don't call him Moscow Mitch for nothing.

[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-livid-after-california-allows-statewide-mail-in-voting-these-votes-must-not-count[comment]Cuz Trump and most republicans would lose their seats if mail in voting was country wide
[comment]Kiss my fucking ass Trump.
[comment]Trump votes by mail himself.
[comment]He told everyone that republicans would never be elected of voting was easier, now everyone knows what they must do, you played yourself Trump!
[comment]Last election he claimed there were 3 million fantasy undocumented immigrants being bussed all over the place to vote in person, so he’s against that also.  Seems to me like he simply hates the thought of anyone voting.
[comment]No, sir. My vote will ALWAYS count!
[comment]I wonder if he realizes that Pennsylvania passed election law reforms, including new mail-in ballot options, *after* he barely eeked out a win there in 2016.
[comment]Let’s have the vote shoved up your ass.
[comment]The president of the United States is saying that the votes of some citizens must not count. This is getting normalized.
[comment]Good thing states run their own elections
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]Like it matters for him in California anyway, which he has zero chance of winning.
[comment]Trump Jail 2020!
[comment]*Absentee* votes.  Don't let them control terminology.  People know and are comfortable with absentee ballots and thats all this is.
[comment]Trump and the GOP seem intent on testing the ['4 Boxes' theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_boxes_of_liberty).
[comment]All the states rights Republicans are really going to give it to him for meddling in state elections and... Oh right.
[comment]The US military mostly votes by mail.  I guess their votes don't count?
[comment]So does that mean in Trump's weird world that states that have mail in voting, they don't count either?? Gimme a break!
[comment]Absentee ballots have been a thing since the US Civil War.  The US military votes by mail.  Is he going to disenfranchise active military from voting?

Trump only opposes mail in ballots because Republican strategists told him too many voters is bad for him.  The only fraud is Republicans trying to suppress the vote.
[comment]Oregon has voted by mail for years. Is he all the sudden going to say our votes don’t count either?
[comment]He should really just shut the fuck up. The states decide how they hold elections, not the Feds. Republicans were the one's who brought this all way to the Supreme Court. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder
[comment]He's rather transparently and poorly laying out the ground work to dispute the election if it doesn't turn out in his favour.
[comment]Wow they really should have the President take an oath or something to uphold the Constitution and let everyone do conditionally protected things like vote.

Oh wait...
[comment]&gt;‘These Votes Must Not Count’

Seems like a declaration of war on America to me.
[comment]Our president hates people voting. Lol
[comment]There should be an ad that basically paints Trump as someone who doesn’t believe in democracy, particularly voting, and put audio where Trump says that the USPS is a “joke” and this comment Trump said.
[comment]Is he really gonna try to say he’s win California otherwise 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[comment]Trump can suck my Washingtonian balls. We vote by mail here and our votes do and will forever count. No reason every state in the union couldn't do the same.
[comment]Statistically speaking, High voter turnout always favors the Democrats.
[comment]How is this not impeachable?  Oh right republicans are anti American cockroaches and tyrants who want to suppress anyone who doesn’t kiss their ass.
[comment]The point is that the Republicans know that the minority of Voters who do support Trump support him enthusiastically and will jump through any Hoops to vote for him. Therefore if you make voting as difficult as possible, only those who feel very strongly will vote, which will increase his chances.

In my opinion the reason he has such a enthusiastic following among the ignorant is a direct response to the election of a black president and many white people feeling that this threatens their prerogatives and privileges.
[comment]My wife and i have been voting by mail for the last 5 years. Military personnel vote by mail.
[comment]Voting is so undemocratic.
[comment]If not for the Cal Supreme Court ruling against the requirement Trump wouldn't have been able to be on the ballot because he won't disclose his taxes.

This is going to be the dirtiest, most cheating and vile election we've ever seen.  Buckle up.
[comment]Seriously what is the big deal?  Does he not want every American’s vote to count?
[comment]People should be allowed to go to the polls if they want. Although the military and Americans abroad mail in their votes, this should not be mandatory and there should be a way to anonymize the vote when possible. There are good reasons why the vote is secret.
[comment]Maybe if the GOP has popular policies then more votes would go to them... the problem is not the voters. The problem is policies.
[comment]Wait till he finds out about Arizona. 😆
[comment]And notably, has he deluded himself into believing he could win California? 🙄
[comment]Says the man who mails in his vote
[comment]I am not particularly well versed in politics and I am honestly confused. What is with people being against mail-in ballots?
[comment]This just shows you if you haven't already known that this guy is so fucked up in the head I mean he really thinks he can win California. Donald j drumpf is losing his fucking mind and the right-wing followers of this dear leader I guess aren't smart enough to realize it, because once again as I always say in a cult the dear leader is always right and you do what you're told and you never, ever go against the dear leader even though this wannabe dictator is always fucking wrong. And what a mother freaking liar this guy is my gosh I've never seen such a person in my life.

[comment]Make sure to means test the recipients first!
[comment]Come on Nancy you know better than we do that Donald j drumpf doesn't do what he is supposed to do, he does what his personalities tell him to do and that's depending on what personality is in charge at the moment, this is not funny I'm not trying to make a joke this is serious and this virus is a serious situation for all of us not just in the United States but around the world, and we have one of the dumbest m.f.ing wannabe dictators in charge. To all Americans please do not listen to Donald j drumpfwhen it comes to anything but especially the coronavirus rules,
please listen to the CDC recommendations to stay safe and free of the virus, I'm even talking to the followers of the dear leader at least to the ones that are smart enough not to listen to him but to the CDC.
[comment]He already did.
[comment]Heard he did this on early morning NPR...
[comment]Leave it to Democrats to be agains UBI because people who have money might get it too...

[comment]You did good Andrew!  Keep involved in politics.  Your ideas need you to champion them!
[comment]I liked a lot of his novel ideas, even the crazy ones.
[comment]He had some good ideas. Hopefully he stays in politics.
[comment]But he's the most popular candidate as decided by Reddit. /s
[comment]One of the few people running I respect
[comment]Girl bye
[comment]That dude was brutally honest about it. I respect that.
[comment]He was never gonna go far in this run, but he certainly made a name for him. I hope he invests his newfound political capital wisely and we hear from him again.
[comment]And that was the nicest article CNN has ever written about him.

Hope we get a good endorsement soon.
[comment]See ya in 2024 bro.
[comment]Thank you for running an amazing campaign Yang!
[comment]I was hoping he would gain some momentum as his ideas are fantastic.
[comment]What  a shame for yang to drop
[comment]The yang gang got gang banged.  Run for Senate!
[comment]It wasn’t his time yet, he made his mark and he’s young enough to return... at the end of the day, he worked really hard for this and I’m glad he can finally go home and rest with his family
[comment]hopefully there are other offices he can run for and add some experience.
[comment]I'll miss his campaign slogan.
[comment]Yang's ideas, impact and the movement he built were so important for many reasons. Presently, it expanded the progressive lane which gives a more positive perspective on other candidates as not so radical. And as witnessed currently by the rise of Bernie, a message over time allows it to percolate, mature and warm up voters to ideas that were once deemed too farfetched. In 10 years, UBI will be a very real discussion because of what Andrew Yang did in the past few months.
[comment]Wonder if Bernie gets a bump
[comment]I think yang should run for mayor of a major city (preferably NY for the exposure on UBI or Detroit to help turn around an area most affected by automation) and show off what his plans can do there. That way he can get some valuable experience and he can give the most extensive demonstration of his UBI plan yet.

I think he would be an okay senator or house member as well, but honestly I think a lower-level executive role is much more fitting considering his style and the fact that he's gonna have a much easier time implementing a UBI on a smaller scale as the leader than on a large scale as one of hundreds of congresspeople
[comment]Hopefully he is back in 2024 when more people know his name
[comment]I'll keep my yang sign parked right next to the BERNIE sign in my front yard.
[comment]UBI will eventually be a thing, crazy he was willing to push that mainstream now. I actually expected him to perform better though. I think he outclassed Pete in the debates, personally. I'm still confused what drives people to that dude, other than maybe his age. He is ridiculously smart, but doesn't really have any major policy plans other than... not being part of Washington? Is that all it takes nowadays?
[comment]Yang needs to run in the House or Senate.  We need Dems in Congress.
[comment]Yang’s campaign was too intellectual for this country and reading many of these comments proves that. It’s not that people are dumb and can not understand what he was saying because thinking that would contradict everything he stands for - but people aren’t used to a candidate who so deeply cares about fundamentally changing the way this country operates from how we measure economic success to how we engage with local communities to how we understand mental health and much much more. Yang stood for a better tomorrow and be believed in that. He has now fundamentally changed political rhetoric in this country and reopened the political sphere to normal Americans. It was hard to say goodbye but he really did shake things up and I’m so grateful for that. 

We NEED more people like Yang in this country and I hope he finds a way to stay acutely involved (cmon Bernie - you know what to do). 

Bernie bro in 2016 and I’m ready to return to his cause but never will I forget how an Asian man who likes math inspired me to think harder and want a truly happy country. Yang brought new ideas to the table - let’s not let them go too quickly.
[comment]He wasn't a bad guy and had he succeeded, he would have been a far better president than we currently have.  I applaud his efforts.   I hope the Yang Gang will become Bernie supporters!
[comment]Best candidate in the race by far. It’s a sad day.

[comment]Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

[comment]Ya reckon? I think removing 17,000,000 from the electoral rolls (8% of those who voted in 2016) is more of an issue.

Also, vote flipping voting machines that change votes to GoP.

Also, postal votes - that didn't get sent out. 

Also, minority discrimination where removing polling booths results in discouragement of mostly Democrat voters.

Also, Parscale's order of magnitude larger Facebook/Cambridge Analytica in its current iteration/Russia MkII scam.

Also, good ol boy Karl Rove's access to tallying servers. 

Also, substantive gerrymander in many what would otherwise be swing seats.

I love to be wrong, but I think Trump and the GOP have this sown up. They learnt from last time. America a functional democracy, not.
[comment]Hmm, Biden's base is also old folks. And Sanders has the best healthcare plan for dealing with such a pandemic. Good thing people don't vote on, you know, actual issues or anything! Gotta vote for whoever we're told is more electable.
[comment]It's actually middle-aged older African American voters that back Joe Biden along with I believe white voters with a degree, but seeing all theresults I've seen from the past 2 weeks Joe Biden is adding to his voter base he's picking them off left and right from Bernie or I should he's getting what some people are saying are Bernie's voters in the lower age groups, not as many but he is getting more than expected, and Bernie is getting less of the younger voters and other voting groups than he did in 2016. If you watched the news during the primaries then you know what I'm talkin about as far as Bernie's not bringing out what he brought out in 2016 and Joe Biden is freaking going way over what everyone thought he would do, and it all started in South Carolina, so I want to say something to a man that has more integrity in his little finger than the orange orangutan, wannabe dictator has in his whole body and that person is mr. clyburn of South Carolina. After he came out and endorsed Joe Biden it was like a godsend and once word got out South Carolina did not disappoint and I believe the other states especially the southern States followed South Carolina and James clyburn who gave such a beautiful speech prior to endorsing Joe Biden that people took it to heart and to the bank, so whether you vote for Bernie or for Joe Biden all I hope for is we all get behind whoever the nominee is. I finish all my posts like this, no matter who the Democratic nominee is whether it's Bernie or Biden in the White House we will get something we want, but if it's the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpf then we get nothing we want.

[comment]I can only speak for North Carolina but our rural areas have lost both hospitals and clinics over the last four years. There are some very poor and isolated counties here and I really don’t know how they would fare if this virus gets a foothold in their community.
[comment]I want to believe something will bring trump down but it’s not, they will find ways to blame others and call it a hoax.
[comment]I have run out of give-a-shit for those rural Trump bumpkins.
[comment]Well I’m not convinced that the risk of getting sick is gonna stop him. I think a recession based on the virus will hurt him the most because it will be Easy for dems to say. “Trump said he’d separate us from trade deals that can hurt the economy but look we’re still so tied up in foreign manufacturing that small business are being shuttered because factory workers in China can’t work”
[comment]Trump is going to hurt those that support him the most. As long as he’s triggering the libs, they could care less and will throw themselves over the cliff willingly. He said he loves the poorly educated because he knows he can manipulate them more easily. They’ve been brainwashed into believing the libs are the enemy.

Better late than never, but I'm still dissapointed in them for turning over the one issue that affects them most if I'm not mad about every other chance they had and wasted.
[comment]I don't believe it. They will swallow his BS whole and he will blame Democrats. He'll probably try to sell them his Trump-Dont-Care health plan which is a completely fictitious made up bunch of invective and flatulence.

[comment]Lol!!  You're still planning on running Joe against him, though...so it won't matter.
[comment]The response from Trump is shameful.  People still do not understand how contagious this virus is.  Granted, for those who are healthy, it is not much of a bother.  The problem we will have in this country is the lack of equipment, resources and personnel to deal with those that will become sick enough to need a hospital bed.  We do NOT have enough beds or ventilators for the people that will need them.  WHO do YOU think will get the precious hospital beds &amp; ventilators???
[comment]Vote him out.  Vote blue!

[comment]If there is ever a democrat majority, they need to ram through a shit ton of ethics legislation. Including defining impeachment procedures and removal criteria. 

Maybe even a law enforcement agency that works for Congress that investigates ethics violations in government and isn't subject to executive branch control.

So many lies and misinformation spread  that has irreversibly destroyed 20-25-% of conservatives, with them likely to spread the same nonsense to their offspring . Our country is doomed if we don’t take the senate or the presidency. I’m actually worried about something I never thought was possible ... a civil war. We effectively can’t stop republicans from doing anything . We can’t go to the justice department, nothing is getting done in the senate and trump has likely committed more crimes that barr is covering up . I honestly wish we had some crazies like the right does at this point . We are going down a path that will be very dark and we don’t have enough things in place to fight back .
[comment]The day that Mitch kicks the bucket will be a good day for all of us.
[comment]It really is disgusting and incomprehensible, that it could come to this. The US always had the anti-Russian mentality, but behave worse than Putin right now. And they do it without trying to be subtle about it. It's fascinating in a sad way.

I find it so weird sitting here in Europe and our media don't make too much noise about this. Of course we are all busy with the most threatening virus of all time (/sarcasm) and the conclusion of brexit (even though the real end is still a year away).

I hope we learn from this as we should after every failure. It was an interesting experiment but someone really should pull the plug now, before it gets out of hand (or did we already reach the point of no return).
[comment]I don't think it's a cover up if they've all decided that he committed the crime but the crime is no longer impeachable. There is so much evidence even from the first investigation that they actually changed their argument over time to be "he did it, we know it, but we don't care". I guess it just surprises me that power is more important than legacy.

[comment]To all Democrats, do not despair. History shows that the outcome of this trial is actually good for Democrats. In late 1973, less than a year before his resignation, Nixon lamented to an advisor “it’s the cover-up that gets you.”
Shar Democrats need to  do, is to build evidence upon evidence to turn public opinion.

In the US, 70,000 Americans have died and unemployment has hit 14.7%. The difference: competent government that heeds experts. Vote for that in November.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1258763760413683714?s=09[comment]Another difference;  They have a more intelligent, more compliant populace.
[comment]More points:

They also got hit with MERS more recently, so an epidemic was less abstract for them.

They also have a homogenous population with social solidarity. In the US, we have very poor social cohesion and strong distrust of government. People in the US reject social programs that help them if someone else who doesn’t look like them gets helped more. 

Thought experiment: HRC is president when this happens. Doesn’t matter how smart or competent she is. Easy to imagine Mitch refuses to bring any stimulus to the floor of the senate. Using the DPA to increase testing capacity is called an authoritarian over-reach and Cruz and Cotton call for impeachment. The president, while quite powerful, is less powerful than we often imagine.

It's a shame she wasn't more mindful of where and how to campaign and that Dems thought she was a shoe-in to win in 2016.  This situation would have been much different and far less dire if she were President.

\*edit - spelling

[comment]In a parallel universe, Hillary Rodham Clinton is the 45th President of the United States, and Covid-19 has been significantly mitigated there due to having a functioning Pandemic Office and listening to the scientific experts.

Thanks
[comment]Trump rode the Obama economic recovery that brought the economy to an all time high and lowered black unemployment.

Every president supported Israel.
Trump has done nothing but work against economic success 

He’s been pumping the economy with terribly low interest rates which is unsustainable and he’s destabilized the Middle East by doing what the far right thinks is best...not peace but antagonistic moves to bring about war.
[comment]I have been thinking of how to describe this presidency. It’s like there’s an extreme hypocrite at your church that you can’t stand to be around. This person has a group of influential friends who influence the decision making. This group usually has no power really, they are just all harmless and meaningless gossip. Suddenly, the pastor at the church puts this person in charge of the larger leadership role and is allowed to grant the friends of his liking to nearly all leadership roles. It’s now impossible for you to go to this church. Well, unfortunately we don’t have the option to leave.
[comment]Yeah this is correct. I can’t do 4 more years. Get me out of this circus.

[comment]paywall fail.
[comment]*Full text if paywalled for you; written by Fintan O’Toole*:

Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity.

However bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful.

Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world’s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world’s leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicentre of the pandemic.

As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, “The United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus – like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.”

It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time – wilfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party, and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence.

The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis,
demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV.

If the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world’s leading nation – an idea that has shaped the past century – has all but evaporated.

Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in Düsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas?

It is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways.

What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump – he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety.

Thus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3 that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order.

In Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students travelling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and “recreational activities.”

Georgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1, explained: “We didn’t know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.”

This is not mere ignorance – it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the “deep state” and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right.

Trump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted.

The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump’s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has “total authority”, and on the other that “I don’t take responsibility at all”. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence.

But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump’s presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand “freedom” in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that “freedom” is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (“I Need a Haircut” read one banner this week in St. Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection.

Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder.

And the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here.

That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US – it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality.

And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked “American carnage” and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element.

As things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics.

Either way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again.
[comment]I'm a single issue voter....

Donald Trump's philosophy is

If at first you don't succeed, 

Lie, lie again.

Everybody lies, but Republicans lie more than Democrats, and Trump lies more than anybody else in the world, over 18,000 lies and Counting..

And, you'd think with all that practice he'd be good at lying by now but he can't even keep his lies straight from one hour to the next.

Why do people keep forgetting this.

When you tell a lie you insult the intelligence of the person you are lying to and you destroy your own credibility.

**When Donald Trump lies he destroys America's credibility, and our place in the world.**

**AND HE INSULTS THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOU, HIS BASE,** 

as they are the only ones who still believe what he says.

I think most people can agree that 1) adults need to be in charge of the country; and 2) a good faith opposition party is good for democracy overall.

[comment]the kids voting for Bernie are being brainwashed by Russian propaganda.

The Democratic Party needs be the adults and rein in the wild tantrum caused by the Bernie Bro-Shirts. People who actually know how to get things done in Washington should be the ones that decide who the nominee is because they're the ones that have to work together with the Republicans to compromise.
[comment]ViVa Sanders!
[comment]Article said that 4% of precincts reported in. They can call it for Bernie with 96% unknown? What am I not understanding?
[comment]BLUE WAVE Bernie Or Bust!!!    Lets Go DFL Democrats!     Register everyone you meet to vote this year !!
[comment]#NotMeUs #MedicareForAll #Bernie2020
[comment]Honest question for non Bernie Dems. If Bernie he plurality but not the majority are you hoping to pull it out at the convention? And what impact would a brokered convention have on the general election?
[comment]I'm just glad we knew who the winner was on the day of the caucuses this time.
[comment]I've heard a lot about the Latino voters who chose Bernie overwhelming at 51%, but I think the biggest surprise was self-described moderates/conservative democrats who chose Bernie exactly the same as Biden, 24% to 24%.

<|startoftext|>[title]Trump Can’t Postpone the Election — Congress could push it back a few weeks, but the Constitution sets the end of the term on Jan. 20.
[selftext]https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-cant-postpone-the-election-11588175516[comment]Paywall workaround:

http://archive.is/3M9Li
[comment]People keep saying this, but the fact of the matter is that Trump can do whatever Congress lets him get away with -- and so far, that has been literally anything.
[comment]I don't think the constitution is going to stop Trump from doing what he wants. It certainly hasn't so far.
[comment]Well also it’s not 1 election, it’s 50 at the same time
[comment]One would think that will all the complaining the left did on Trump and his sexual assaults, the Democrats would have a even slightest bit more integrity picking their nominee. Lol what a joke this system is.
[comment]Trump can cancel the election. But Nancy Pelosi will be sworn in as president on January 20th.
[comment]yay--i have hope for a new begiining come jan 21
[comment]Instead of canceling it, he just gets all voting done by mail (which Democrats can't oppose because we're all on record supporting it), then defund the Post Office so that's impossible, and then it's up to state legislatures to select the electors for us (which in turn can often be bribed).
[comment]Let him postpone it all he wants, I'm sure President Nancy Pelosi won't mind.
[comment]Jeez, if only there was a safe no contact way to vote.
[comment]Something tells me that January 19th is going to be a hell of a day....
[comment]What if they passed some sort of executive order extending his term? it appears executive orders can override the Constitution so....
[comment]That is going to be a very nervous few weeks
[comment]On January 21st Trump will be just an ex-President without power no matter what he wants. The only way for him to stay in office would be to change the Constitution or overthrow the government. If he were to throw a tantrum and refuse to leave he would be escorted out by the Sargent of arms. He’ll have as much right to sit in the Oval Office as you or I unless one of us is elected President.
[comment]He could refuse to leave office.
[comment]Trump will just appoint himself "Acting President" like he has done to skirt every other position.
[comment]You can rely on the fact that he will definitely try. Let's not rule out the right-wing SCOTUS Judges getting involved on his behalf either before or after the election.
[comment]If Trump declares a national emergency due to the pandemic and says he is suspending the election to prevent further spread, ALL of his supporters and the entire right-wing media apparatus will applaud and give him their full support. No one in the Trump administration, the right-wing media or the majority of people in the GOP give a shit about what the Constitution does or does not say. They only care about power. Mitch McConnell will completely support a move like this. Why wouldn't he?

Edit: Spelling and grammar
[comment]Not true.  They could and his term would expire with the VP as well.   The result would be speaker of the house taking over assuming California Gov appoints her as a representative after her term expires,  which he can do if voting is postponed
[comment]Get him out now. He’s fired. We need impeachment for this present matter!

<|startoftext|>[title]If Bloomberg Wants to Buy an Election, He Should Run as a Republican Against Trump—Not Sabotage Democrats
[selftext]https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/11/if-bloomberg-wants-buy-election-he-should-run-republican-against-trump-not-sabotage[comment]Kind of like Bernie with money?
[comment]He is for gun control, raising taxes on the rich, expanding obamacare... why would he run as a republican when he is clearly a democrat.
[comment]Definitely not the biggest Bloomberg fan but he’s quite a bit to the left of Manchin so how would running as a Republican make any sense?
[comment]He shouldn't be able to run as a democrat, period.  The rules shouldn't be changed so that he can participate.
[comment]https://www.dan-margolis.com/why-im-supporting-mike-bloomberg-for-president/
[comment]We’re presupposing he cares about the country though, and not merely his own vanity.
[comment]Still disappointed Trump had no serious primary challengers.  Infighting is one of the major reasons we lost in 2016, maybe it could've done Trump in.
[comment]You can't buy something that isn't for sale....quit being for sale
[comment]Stop, ask, frisk was originally passed with bipartisan support.
[comment]Um, party lines arent just chosen at random. It's based upon a loose set of principles. I'm not for trump but calling for a candidate to switch sides just to get trump out totally sounds ignorant. The president is a figurehead in many regards. The party has more power than the President. If you don't believe me, just look at the impeachment trial.
[comment]Mike should run as a Republican because he's a fucking racist ass hole
[comment]Heck ya! He's a republican anyway.
[comment]This argument fits into both the Bernie Bro camp and the Russian sow Democratic distention to help Trump camp.  Regardless, UNIFY or Die.
[comment]Except that clearly a good amount of Democrats support him in recent polls
[comment]Why would he run as a republicans?
[comment]Commondreams is leftist breitbart. It is not a legitimate news source.

[comment]More Bernie Bro spam.
[comment]That $600 million dollars could be spent in so many better ways than stupid commercials. If he took $600 million and fed and clothed people he would have a staggering number of votes right now. Instead we get to see his lame commercials which is nothing but an ego stroke from a racist guy who will spent over half a billion but doesn't want higher taxes on himself.
[comment]What Bloomberg should do is buy Fox News and make it an actual news station instead of a propaganda machine.
[comment]GOP is for when you steal the election, not buy it.
[comment]Anyone who would post they prefer Trump to Bloomberg, or would abstain is likely a Russian troll. Yes Bloomberg overspends in ads but at least he has integrity. I'm not saying I prefer him as the nominee but I prefer the Democrat nominee over Trump

[comment]**But don't get complacent! Vote no matter what!**
[comment]Real talk raw economic forecasts in this insanity seem inadequate.  

Also something that has Biden winning OH and N.C. but not Arizona seems laughable.
[comment]Don’t miss this one. Register now.
[comment]Don't get me wrong I'll eat a literal crow if it ends up true but this model is dogshit
[comment]VOTE
[comment]I know everyone hates this comment.

Polls are only accurate when we work to get everyone registered and to the voting booth! But most importantly, get yourself registered and to the voting booth. The vote is all the matters.
[comment]Still way, *way, way,* ***way*** too much red. 

But then, 30% of the country are certified idiots, so...
[comment]We’ve heard this before. Fucking vote
[comment]We won Hawaii last election lol and I think we flip Florida or Arizona instead of ohio
[comment]Promise?
[comment]marketwatch trying to jinx us
[comment]When people say “don’t get complacent and don’t trust the polls” - correct them by saying:

“Run up the score on the gop.  Vote your ass off!” - it uses positivity and optimism as the catalyst to vote and look forward vs. using fear.
[comment]Do not get complacent!
[comment]OH and NC, but not AZ? Suspect.  And HI is not flipped
[comment][This](https://www.270towin.com/maps/0mjkZ)is my prediction as of now.
[comment]Look realistically he lost by over three million votes last time and still here we are. So nobody get any kind of hope until 2024 and even then he's probably going to win again
[comment]Ignore this, he could still win. Show up and vote!
[comment]VOTE and make sure your friends do too.
[comment]That would explain why the Democrat states are against opening up "and I thought it was because they were saving lives". 
The economy will thrive and you all know it.
[comment]In normal times with a candidate who could tie his own shoes maybe.
[comment]I really hope this ages well
[comment]Sad that he doesn't face historic defeat irrespective of the economy, but if that is what it takes, I'll take it.  We need him OUT (and jailed, but I'm not holding my breath).
[comment]Doesn't matter. Campaign and vote as if we were 5 points down in every state.
[comment]This is not an accurate interpretation. They are looking at these number and drawing conclusions based on the unemployment rate and other economic statistics, but they fail to account for the level of blame that is shifted from Trump to the pandemic. In a normal year with an economic collapse and 20% joblessness yes the sitting president would get railed in the next election. But that is not the case, many of the people they expect to abandon trump won’t because they don’t see this as his fault.
[comment]If Trump loses we will not know whether he truly lost until December 14 when the electoral votes in each state have to be certified. Trump being Trump he will sue the heck out of the states, claiming widespread voter fraud. It will be Florida 2000 on steroids. If his loss is close, with the help of his friends at the SCOTUS, he could even pull it off by "uncounting" some democratic states... So, we'll have to wait....
[comment]PA isn't flipping, sorry. This is based on a crazy small sample size, sure, but I'm from PA in a mix of city/rural area, and every seems to have pegged Democrats as evil power-grabbers of the pandemic.

Covid is certainly not damaging Repubs here. They let the problem get so bad it takes drastic political action just to sort of flatten the curve and then blame it on "government" and people eat it up, as if Republicans weren't part of the government. It genuinely pisses me off.
[comment]God I hope it’s right. I just remember the trauma of 2016 when all the polls showed Hilary was ahead and then afterwards I couldn’t even get out of bed.
[comment]For Pete's sake! Do we need to have the world falling apart for people to realize how despicable, incompetent and retarded Trump and company is?
Yeah, we are even more retarded than him.
[comment]Also, they have Arizona red-- I think its going blue this time, Mark Kelly is going to drive people to vote for him, which means, not Trump.
[comment]Pennsylvania is going to be red. People love him here.
[comment]I don't see how Arizona doesn't flip blue. "Let old people die to save the economy" isn't real popular with all the old people here. Also Kelly should crush Mcsally.
[comment]Didn’t we get complacent in 2016, and we ended up with trump. I hate the feel good, we got the bad man based off polling. 

Trump only faces defeat if we VOTE. Polling does nothing but give people false hope that we’ve won. PLEASE VOTE AND DON’T BE COMPLACENT.
[comment]Historic as in someone punting him ala Uncle Phill style out of the white house after he loses, or as in loses by a huge margin despite voter suppression and russian interference?
[comment]VOTE
[comment]Why is Hawaii labeled as flip to blue? Wasn't it already blue
[comment]If we work, Arizona can flip. If we work, Florida can flip.
[comment]Doesn’t matter. Honestly, I feel that these studies just shouldn’t be put out. It makes people feel like they don’t have to go out and vote. No matter what, EVERYBODY GO VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. This is going to be my first Presidential Election and I fully intend to make it count.
[comment]Based on what I have compiled - it’s 337-201 for Biden. This is based on RCP Averages and if no polls, then I just used the 2016 result. Chances are if there aren’t polls, the state isn’t changing.
[comment]I watch and read these reports everyday but its important  that make GOTV outreach our priority. Especially with absentee ballots a main-point of frame. Talking about how to  register, rules and regulations, lastly, the court battles ahead.
[comment]Trump lost bigly in Hawaii in 2016.
[comment]Plus he's a monry-launderer for the Russian mob.
[comment]How is economy his fault ? It was booming before the virus. Did you ever give him credit for unemployment all time low and s&amp;p all time high?
[comment]Today as I was heating up supper I thought anyone who voted for this ass clown should be paraded in the streets to do the walk of shame. They brought shame and dishonour to America.
[comment]Even propaganda couldn't keep them out of hot water this time.
[comment]IGNORE THE POLLS!  They were WRONG in 2016.  To say goodbye to Trump,  you must VOTE!
[comment]Cool story, but forgive me if I don’t trust white people to vote for a democrat just because Trump is a liar, an asshole, a cheat and a danger to this country. All of these things were true in 2016 and they’re even more true now. Ugh.
[comment]Weird that the map has Hawai’i as flip to Democrat. Hillary won here in 2016 with the highest margin of any state.
[comment]Lest we forget how he won the first time.... Trump could lose the electoral vote "bigly" and still get a 2nd term ..... every single vote will count<|endoftext|>

Biden needs to beat Trump electorally.  In 2016, Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million by won the electoral college by 5 states with just 75K votes.

Biden needs to beat Trump overwhelmingly to show Republicans that this country wants none of the Republican bullshit.
[comment]Bull$hit. Anyone remember this?  [Hillary has a 93% chance of winning](https://i.imgur.com/gaQLSFW.jpg)
[comment]We need to beat trump in a landslide. Everyone has to vote. If we only beat him by anything less than 10% they will attempt to invalidate the election and start a civil war. Everyone in every town across America needs to vote against him and all republicans. Only then will we find peace.
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.

Keep fighting until January 20, 2021. Keep working on non-political friends. Win at the dinner tables and coffee tables. We win when we vote. We win because we have better ideas and an inclusive vision for America.
[comment]All he has to do is smile and not say anything and he should win.
[comment]Just thought I’d remind you guys that Hillary was supposed to have the same sort of lead in the polls
[comment]Only if we vote for him! Go Joe!
[comment]This is still way to low. Its actually fucking depressing.
[comment]It don’t matter if we don’t vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.
[comment]I don’t care. VOTE
[comment]Let's wirk harder to a point that Biden be 80%ahead of TRUMP...let's not make same mistake of 2016
[comment]Polls don't matter. Vote
[comment]That lead aint big enough
[comment]Not good enough. Run up the score. Lets beat him by 20 points and humiliate the fuck out of Trump.
[comment]I'm not very enthusiastic about voting for Biden (seems like a nice guy just super out of touch) but I will. Same as I did for Hillary. I really wish the Democratic party could come up with better candidates.
[comment]Trump isn't even trying to be a real President, leading the country through a period of building crises. The stupid thing is that in times like this the country yearns to be led. Anyone who even tries gets some benefit of the doubt and receives bipartisan support, like many Governors from both parties currently.
[comment]This isn't just about Republicans either, it's other Democrats who are fine with another 4 years of Trump because Bernie lost or because they only agree with 90% of Biden instead of 100%
[comment]Got to keep it up! Have to spot Trump at least 5 points, imo, because of Republican voter supression, fraud, and an unbalanced electoral college.
[comment]Trump's not completely stupid -- he's trying to start a civil war because it's basically his only chance. Barr's going to help him round up his enemies, you just watch.
[comment]Don't get cocky folks, Trump used the complacency strategy last time too.  Everyone was so sure Hillary wod win they just didn't bother showing, or voted for Jill Stein like I did.
[comment]And yet, Trump leads in *every state he won in 2016*.
[comment]Remember when Hillary had a 20-point lead. These polls are jokes
[comment]We must VOTE to make this happen! Believe no polls. And it has to be a landslide so that Trump cannot refuse to leave OUR White House.
[comment]Compared to 2 points two months ago. Holy shit
[comment]I would like a moratorium on all posts about Biden being ahead. If every single one of our blue asses doesn't turn up in November, we are sunk. Don't forget everyone in Wyoming gets 2.4 votes to yours, or something like that. VOTE!
[comment]Obligatory and unnecessary: "don't be complacent" and "I hate polls like this. We have to get busy"
[comment]Remember nov 2016 and the distortion that could be caused by electoral college system. It is not popular vote based election and Russian government is helping him. 
Don’t be overly confident on this.
[comment]DONT TRUST THE POLLS! REMEMBER 2016? PLEASE VOTE!
[comment]More importantly a poll came out with Biden up +6 in Michigan.
[comment]Polls don't mean shit.
Except the one taken on November 3rd.

Fuck these polls.

Vote.
[comment]Keep him hidden and don't let him talk. We need to remove Trump, and this is the garbage fire we were given. Prop him up!
[comment]Just VOTE! PLEASE!! I don't want to see the US turn into an authoritarian dictatorship.
[comment]Let’s not get cocky!
[comment]Biden will gain some ground the next few months albeit slowly.  Luckily we get to replace one asshole with another - yet a lesser asshole.

[comment]No man can walk so long in the Shadow that he cannot come again to the Light.

[comment]Fox News is acting like state media more than ever, broadcasting the trial without sound and with conservative pundits "explaining" what is happening by using GOP talking points. It's total bullshit. It's like the two sides are arguing from different realities. This is why Nancy Pelosi (to give some credit to her political foresight) wanted to hold off; she knew the Republicans would be shredding the Constitution on the senate floor. Almost half the GOP senators skipped out on the trial entirely the first two days. The right is claiming the left is partisan, and here they are with their minds already made up to exonerate.

This is how we should frame the charges against the President:

The President hijacked Congressionally allocated public funds and used them as bargaining chip in a sleazy personal deal for his own benefit with the government of a foreign nation. This is a slippery executive slope that leads to presidents openly giving and receiving bribes to influence policy, and even misappropriating public funds entirely for their own gain.

The president, like every president, is governing the whole country, not just his base. He is accountable to those of us who did not elect him (the majority in fact) and who are unhappy with his business as usual.

[comment]It really doesn't matter who is president both parties are the same and never get shit done. That and it's more important who is in the House and Senate. They make the Bill's and set the budgets. They maintain the status quo so they stay in power and we stay on the bottom. Hillary probably would have been better than Trump, but fuck the DNC for pushing her and Biden over Sanders. Blame the DNC for pissing a bunch of people off by them pushing who they want to run, instead of us voting who we want to run. Don't let either party let you get sucked in to their bs. Always vote for who you want to run, not who your party wants you to vote for.
[comment]Hillary would not have let things get like this.
[comment]And those people are doing it again with their EvRyOnE eXcEpT BeRnIe Is A rEpUbLiCan.
[comment]The Russians did a helluva job pushing this narrative in the primary and general in 2016.  If you fell for it, shame on you.  If you fell for it again in 2020, you have no excuse. 

If Bernie Sanders loved his country, he would have understood what the FBI told him about Russian interference on his behalf and suspended his campaign.  What they are doing (and did in in '16) is triangulation.  Use Sanders to poison the well in the Democratic primary, suppress support on the left, then prop up Trump while pushing the false "Hillary/Biden is corrupt" narrative to stoke up the plurality of dumb dumbs on the right to have enough of a plurality to win in a low turnout situation.

There's a reason Trump had Rudy Giuliani do what he did in the Ukraine: he didn't want to face Joe Biden in the Fall.  Getting Biden out of the way was the goal that made him impeachable.  

Because it always goes back to Donald Trump.
[comment]With the amount of love Wall Street had for HRC and Bill I think they are not the savior that we had hoped for. The reality is no political party is in a position to deal with this. The closest thing would be what this party calls a revolution that no one wants. 

A question that I felt like they missed in the debate and the thing Biden keeps talking about when asked about Yang (not the MATH). He says Yang has a vision for the next industrial revolution and it is upon us. That should maybe be the focus. I know we fear that airlines going BK is bad. Instead of infusing money into the corporations that are profit over people we should maybe hear what Yang is thinking is coming, something Biden agrees with, and then maybe the money we are printing is used for this approach. Giving Casino's, Airlines and others this money that just evaporated and did nothing to stabilize the market and think about how the people can be a part of owning the next iteration of those. 

The what we could of done is not important. What a Democrat should do is look at the future. Where are we heading vs the past and using whataboutisim, that is the other side. We gotta be thinking about tomorrow not 2016 or 2008.
[comment]Hillary would've only been slightly better. Our system is broken.
[comment]Actually Joe and Hilary supported the Irag war like a republican....
[comment]STOP BLAMING THE PEOPLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM!

Seriously, get over it. It’s almost 4 years later - start focusing on the future, not the past. You aren’t going to change anything by making people apologize and explain themselves for not voting Hillary - especially when the people did vote for her but the electoral college flipped the results. 

There’s so much misplaced anger here and you’re just driving people apart in a time that we should all be rallying together.
[comment]Hilary hate is a real disease. How anyone could think she and trump are the same or that she’s worse is beyond me. It seems people still haven’t learned their lesson.

We sold them those weapons.... 😂😂😂😂then went to war about it. Stupid war that should not be forgiven so easily
[comment]But her emails!
[comment]After the developments over the last four years of this despicable administration, I feel like these discussions are almost moot.

The Republican party have fucked our system so fully that it's almost useless for their adversaries to continue. When we win, they dig their heels in and prevent any progress we attempt. They showcase their trademark faux feelings of being offended, and then begin the Fox News rollercoaster of misinformation and vitriol. I can't decide whether I blame the lawmakers for being so comfortable lying to their constituents or their voters for willingly believing such hateful bullshit.

Thanks to Mitch McConnell, Donald McGahn, and the Federalist Society, nothing can be accomplished anymore. They've changed the rules, pumping out confirmations for incompetent, strongly conservative judges at breakneck speed. Lifetime appointments, ensuring a small group of selfish assholes will be the only ones with a fighting chance at the pursuit of happiness, for at least the next twenty years. 

I realize it's what they want, but I can't help it; I've lost all hope and can barely bring myself to stay informed. Even if we win, we've already lost.
[comment]They will never admit to their bumbling mistake of voting for the anti christ
[comment]It's fucking unbelievable that any Democrat could make the analogy of someone being "wrong on the level of the Iraq war" when Democrats apparently forgot that *Joe Biden fucking voted for it*!

Hold people in contempt and have them arrested if they refuse to cooperate. I understand the need to gradually tighten the screws on Trump, but at some point we’ll need to go beyond tough talk if we want to get these goons out of office.

[comment]She is not dumb.
[comment]The irony is that after all the years of being demonized by GOP she emerges as a central force in guiding the investigation in to abuse of presidential power.

But the president is just the tip of the iceberg - the figurehead - of a greater problem. We have the president we have because of a failure of the GOP to provide any other alternative. If for no other reason than by omission the party allowed Trump to be the standard bearer for the party. But in reality he is just a red herring, a distraction while the GOP continues to dismantle governmental regulatory controls and allow big business free rein at the expense of the American people.

Time for a change.

<|startoftext|>[title]Obama Said Publicly Shaming People On Twitter Is "Not Activism"
[selftext]https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/obama-call-out-culture-yara-shahidi[comment]He's right.
[comment]Still making space for the shitty behavior of republicans, i see. This sounds noble and everything, but this mentality is why the Bush regime was never investigated for war crimes, and why republican shittiness was given space to escalate during Obama's administration. You can turn the other cheek TOO much. Sometimes you have to block the punch and say "ENOUGH, fuckers!".
[comment]I love Obama but molesting women went from “what you gonna do?” To jail mother fuckers and destroying careers from shaming people on Twitter. I get where he’s coming from but he cites ambiguities but Is missing the ambiguities of this phenomena. Also a significant amount of acceptance of lgbtq issues that came from this. Good and bad Stuff came from this just like every other thing human beings do. So moving the needle massively for at least 2 groups of people that are marginalized makes me err on the side of this is activism
[comment]That is true.
[comment]Winning the war of public opinion is very important however. Republicans prove this with their endless smear campaigns and frankly Democrats need to fight fire with fire more often.
[comment]I would think this is common sense but here we are.
[comment]Sometimes it is...
[comment]I really miss that dude.
[comment]I mean it's also the purity tests. Warren supporters hold every other candidate to impossible standards while deriding everything they don't like about their candidate as an unfair attack. Her cultish populism scares me.
[comment]He couldn’t of summed  it up better. Cancel culture on social media is essentially armchair activism for the most part.
[comment]Hey, where did we land on that Kony 2012 thing?
[comment]I miss having him as president but dude, if he would've clapped back more often and quit seeking compromise with bad-faith rat-bastard republicans, we might not have had to be in this mess now.
[comment]Fuck that means that like 97% of millenial and gen z activists are actually activisting
[comment]Who is surprised that Obama gets it. Just think of how much better off the country would be if there was never a 22nd Amendment.
[comment]What did he say about posting memes on Reddit about Hong Kong? Because if that's not activism, then I don't know what to believe anymore!!
[comment]Obama has a small point that it is not enough to simply shame bad language on twitter.  He goes way off the rails when he then claims:

" “This idea of purity, and you’re never compromised, and you’re always politically woke and all that stuff. You should get over that quickly,” he said. “The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws.” 

Isn't it funny how dems are always told to compromise but Republicans NEVER do since Newt Gingrich?

&amp;#x200B;

Given that the ideologically pure Tea Party kicked his ass for 10 years straight, took the house, senate, judiciary, blocked his nominees, blocked his legislation, dismantled much of his legacy, then took the white house and put a criminal in there who is now stacking the courts with judges who will likely never be removed.  You'd think Obama would have learned that all his compromise with Republican Right Wing Tea Party has only made them stronger and Dems weaker.  Sometime I wonder if this guy was secretly Republican all along.  He reminds me of those cowards who appeased Hitler and Confederates pre-war, and all the compromises only made the evil people stronger, bolder until it blew up into all out war.
[comment]Only 22% of Americans use Twitter. 10% of those 22 are making 80% of the content on Twitter. Twitter is not real life, and we need to stop acting like it is.

[Source](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/)
[comment]So nice to hear a president that speaks in complete coherent sentences again
[comment]Yeah, 'direct action' would be burning their house down yourself.
[comment]It’s not activism, but it’s not necessarily bad either! 

Some people/institutions should absolutely get roasted all the time in every context imaginable.
[comment]but,, how else will the "woke" ones let us know who to hate?
[comment]The Twitter verse simply needs to be ignored.
[comment]Then publicly shaming them in real life isn't activism either. But that's what protests are and you can literally do both.

Because that's how free speech works.
[comment]Oh look, a Boomer who doesn't get with the times.

It does count as activism, especially considering the undeniable IMPORTANCE of social media to the Millennials. Sure, a Boomer sees it as a little distraction on the side, but to the younger generations?
[comment]No shit. Young progressive twitter’s “cancel culture” is beyond stupid and the most any of them will ever do for political activism.
[comment]Yeah, but I remember 2 or 3 protest who genesis was Twitter. So, I disagree with the president on this. Twitter has motivated many to run for office,  and get support and funding. Ifnit were not useful Trump would have been on it for the last decade.
[comment]The truth hurts.
[comment]Trump could learn a lot from President Obama if he wasn't so freaking jealous of him. If Trump had just an ounce of the class and integrity that President Obama has,  then he probably would not be in the situation he is in now. 
And, frankly,  no one should insult anyone in any way when they know nothing about that person.
[comment]&gt;Obama went on to say, "This idea of purity, and you're never compromised, and you're always politically woke and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly."

&gt;Calling for more nuance in difficult conversations, Obama said, "The world is messy, there are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids and share certain things with you."

Glad he's saying it.
[comment]I disagree, calling out bad actors and publically shaming them is absolutely legitimate activism. It's definitely not the only thing a person should be doing to effect change, but I disagree with, B-Money on this one.
[comment]Lol, idiot.
[comment]But bombing the middle East multiples times a day during your entire presidency is?

Of course, I’m not one to automatically assume the constitution is important to others; it’s certainly a mixed bag, and a racist bourgeois one at that. 

I’m of the opinion that if we decide to get behind politicians who stop diverting the blame away from who is really responsible for our societal ills (monopoly enterprise, intelligence agencies, bipartisanship - in that order) and start taking steps to really help the working class, there’d be a less dense accumulation of grievance and therefore less raw material to be churned into misdirected hate by politicians and talking heads on both sides

[comment]She’s a grifter and a con.
[comment]To me she seems believable that something happened to her, though at this point I couldn't say what. Contradicting details and confusion over what exactly happened, and how they responded, isn't exactly unusual, and neither is suddenly coming forward about it much later. There is reason to believe something traumatic happened to her based on what could be found through some past testimony and documentation from her divorce.

What made me finally lean in Biden's direction, as an outside observer, are the logistical problems for him to attack her in the way described, the apparently impossible fund raiser story, and the lie she told about her education. As an outside observer, I can't in good conscience say Biden likely did it. I'm glad some journalists took it seriously, and were able to put out a more clear investigative report (like PBS), woth extensive interviews with past colleagues and experts. That helped some in me change my opinion.

<|startoftext|>[title]Virginia will eliminate a state holiday honoring Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. It'll make Election Day a day off instead
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/virginia-ends-confederate-holiday-replace-election-day-trnd/index.html[comment]Sweet. Election Day should be a paid holiday nation wide.
[comment]Yay!!!
[comment]"But how will we win if we let people vote?" -Republicans
[comment]What — legislators did something sensible? I think I finally landed in a universe I can enjoy!
[comment]My mother belongs on /r/insanepeoplefacebook. She said this is a precursor to the left coming to take all of our guns away.

She's a midwesterner who has transplanted to florida and is semi-retired. She lives in a boomer echo chamber where any mention of removing statues or removing public adoration for the confederacy is somehow the left planning a takeover and indoctrination. It's downright looney.

I got tagged in one of these where she was all "see"? 

I typed in a public post that both Obama and Clinton each had 8 years to take our guns and couldn't even get that done. Gosh, what shitty presidents.
[comment]I have a feeling this could enrage Republicans and turn state red again OR (if enough people vote) state could be blue for a long time.
[comment]Yup yup. Yup. Hopefully passed before 2020
[comment]Good.  Election Day should be a day off nationwide.
[comment]Well good for Virginia!!! Now can the rest of the country do the same for election day?!?!
[comment]Its unfortunate that people such as myself still won't get this holiday off work. But this is a huge step in the right direction.
[comment]This day was actually Lee-Jackson-King day in Virginia until 2000. Yes. You heard it right! It celebrated Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson...as in Lee and Jackson of the Confederacy AND simultaneously Martin Luther King..of...I don't really need to go on. Do I?

Is/Was Lee-Jackson Day a day people get off work in Virginia? I didn't think so. 

I don't predict this is going to make too many people angry except maybe in rural areas? Now, tearing down the statues is a totally different ball of wax.
[comment]Robert E Lee is a goddamn hero. He could not bring himself to fight against his homestate of Virginia. He is also the reason why the Civil War ended at his surrender and shot down southern ideas of continued insurrection following the surrender of the south. The union would not have reunified without him.

The Civil War was fought over slavery, but that is not why Lee fought.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that this day should probably be removed, but don't make him into a villain.
[comment]How bout the next one be the Day of Straight Up Compassion.
[comment]This is an amazing development.  Voting is always the most patriotic holiday.
[comment]Those infamous historical figures should be talked about so people don’t repeat history, but I am glad they aren’t being celebrated and that Election Day is a day off (as it should be). 

I’ve had parents who watch the Hannity channel flip out over this, saying the left is trying to rewrite history (and yes they are boomers). I’ve explained to them how Fox News is very unreliable and that America isn’t erasing history, we are simply not celebrating the confederation. We will learn about them and not forget about that time period, we just aren’t celebrating traitors, which is what they are. Maybe if people grow up seeing that these figures aren’t being celebrated than the whole “the south will rise” mentality will start to fade as well as bigoted ideas.
[comment]If you wonder why you suddenly see so much news about common sense reform happening in Virginia, see [this](https://i.imgur.com/BpAwiII.png) and [this.](https://i.imgur.com/nk6aXgY.png)

Virginia has an entirely Democratic government right now.

I live in Michigan. We've had the exact opposite for a solid 8 years, a trifecta of GOP control. Our roads are shit, our schools are shit, Flint happened, were still fighting the federal government over trying to keep the Great Lakes clean, it's like Mad Max over here.
[comment]You creatures sicken me.
[comment]The Confederate government issued a standing order that all African-Americans caught in uniform were to be killed on the spot or sold into slavery. There is no record of any Confederate general protesting that illegal order. Lee never tried to stop his men from murdering blacks they caught.

Robert E Lee and Stonewall jackson are war criminals. That's your heritage.
[comment]Good! I hate participation trophies.
[comment]I'm sorry to say this because I don't know you but it sounds like your mother could be a casualty or even a member of the dear leader Donald j drumpf cult following and for your mother's well being you need to stop her if she is doing this from only watching state-run FAUX NEWS because this is where most of the lies are coming from and the other news station is oan one America news this new station makes FAUX NEWS look almost normal, I mean oan is the conspiracy news channel these people are absolutely batshit crazy. And no the Democratic party or anybody else want anything to do with taking people's guns it's just a right-wing conspiracy talking point but tell your mom what isn't a conspiracy talking point but is the truth,It's that Donald j drumpf wants to take healthcare away from people especially people with pre-existing conditions and he's lying to everybody when he gets on TV and says he's trying to save it and if she doesn't believe you just get online because there's a case pending in federal court right now from the Democrats to stop the administration from taking healthcare away.
[comment]Good tradeoff.

[comment]Huh? Virginia using its brain, go figure
[comment]This is amazing. Looking forward to the day this is standard.
[comment]Well that’s two things that they’re doing correct.  
Now if they could explain how to take guns from actual criminals instead of people that are abiding by the law.
[comment]Just an FYi - Robert E. Lee was a Democrat.

[comment]No, this isn't "New Video" it's the same video.
[comment]There could be a hundred videos and these white pigs are never going to see the inside of a jail. Just the way it is. 

1. It's the south. 

2. The shooters are white.

3. It a former cop, and his son. 

4. The victim is black. 

5. The D.A. is *already* making excuses for NOT arresting them.   

6. Did I mention a white, former cop, in the south, shot a black man for no reason and the DA refuses to investigate.

Pretty much a lynching minus the crowd and souvenir snatching by the assembled crowd.

Damn, time literally stands still in the south, doesn't it?
[comment]#blacklivesmatter
[comment]Maybe someone can explain where the proof of the white guys being guilty is in the video?  I don't see it.  What I see is the black man running toward the truck, I see the video suddenly showing a view of nothing, I see the black man run around the side of the truck and then I can't see what's going on.  I hear gun shots, I see the black man and the white guy struggling over the white guy's gun... then I hear the last gunshot and the black guy finally starts to try and run away from the guys before he collapses.  But no where do I see enough to know what the hell was going on.  Yet here we have all these people dead set that it was murder...  at the very least someone explain why he was running toward the truck and trying to wrestle a gun from the white guy.
[comment]It’s upsetting how many comments here bringing up armed protesters, while the focus should be terrible police force.
[comment]Not a single armed black person protesting as far as I know.
[comment]Murica'. Claims to be first world, yet kills innocent people.
[comment]Why is this posted on this sub ?
[comment]This was a goddamned lynching. But everyone should understand that these men will not be arrested for this, much less convicted. Too many of their buddies working in law enforcement. Nothing will happen to these men unless the citizens take it upon themselves. Protesting will accomplish absolutely nothing.
[comment]We all bleed red.
[comment]Things will regress further if these two pieces of shit don’t get 20 years to life
[comment]If 2 armed men cornered me I also would be scared for my life and would fight back. You can't outrun a gun, so he probably saw fighting back as possibly his only chance to get away.
[comment]It's really important to understand what happened here. This is a hate crime. A black man was hunted down and killed by two white men after being racially profiled. If the racial roles had been reserved the black men would already be in prison. But the two white men who viciously murdered this black men are still free.

It's 2020 and this kind of racism still existed in the United States.
[comment]You can shoot and kill someone without being arrested?
[comment]How are those fucks not under arrest? That itself is a fucking crime.

[comment]But it might look bad for trump!

Which is more important? trump's image or people's lives? I think trump knows the answer to that.
[comment]This is all true, but I worry that Hillary advocating the basic tenets of doing the right thing is going to make it even less likely that Trump does any of them.

[comment]Agreed, shes right, but she has to realize that the most help she can offer is to just shut up and let others say it.  Her credibility was destroyed and her words cause counter reactions from conservatives. Just go live a quiet life in obscurity Hillary, please, for your own sake and ours.

HAHAHaaaaaa  Trump?  Yeah, that will never happen.
[comment]trump is a sociopath and would not be surprised if he becomes ever more delusional and paranoid which would lead to psychotic sociopathy something you dont want in a leader
[comment]So she's for healthcare for all?
[comment]And tell me again why this person's opinion matters, she's not president, she not in parliament, she had her chance, time to forget about Hillary and move forward.
[comment]We elected Trump not Hillary. Obviously people still don’t get the Republican agenda. I think it’s great that we get this tangible example so that we don’t have to deal with bigger masses later. This is bad, but climate change, healthcare, creating terrorists... those problems are too abstract, and harder to solve
[comment]Ugh she really would’ve been on top of this
[comment]Hillary would have been such a great president. Damn :(
[comment]I really, really wish she were President right now. 

She actually had a plan for exactly this situation as part of her campaign. We were such idiots.
[comment]Not the best candidate...but would have made a great president. I did vote for her though at least
[comment]Did Hillary turn into a Bernie Bro?

[comment]Unsurprising. If I was I betting man I would put money on this election and az
[comment]So much for the "moderate" Tepublican myth. The whole party has been marching further to the right ever since GWB took office. They've lost or radicalized all voters who were remotely moderate, so in order to keep their office, elected Republicans need to pander to the right. There are more truly moderate conservatives in the Democratic party than there are in the Republican party right now...

[comment]The lead ain't big enough
[comment]I can’t wait!  This is going to be epic!

[comment]Glad to hear. Crush her.
[comment]Awesome!
[comment]I bet Suzi is clutching her pearls.
[comment]If people actually vote this time it will be an epic unprecedented blue wave.
[comment]There’s also Betsy Sweet (D) who’s running on a much stronger platform but not getting as much attention as Gideon who beats Collins rn. Betray also promotes policies that are very favorable in this survey.
[comment]Vote. 

Vote. 

Vote. 

Vote until it hurts. 

Then vote again.
[comment]I hate seeing these polls.   While I want Susan Collins to lose big time I think polls like these attract Republicussian attention and efforts towards the specific election
[comment]I hope she and several other republican senators get voted out
[comment]Ann Coulter made the comment that Trump is purposely trying to give the Senate over to the Democrats. His actions lately make me wonder if that’s true. He is totally off the rocker right now.
[comment]Get Fucked Collins
[comment]The thought of Collins getting the boot after the bullshit she's pulled the past few years has me super excited. She's gambled her entire legacy and political future on Trump and that is going to cost her everything.
[comment]Remember the crowdpac fundraiser when she voted for that knucklehead on the bench
[comment]All I want is for a reporter to ask Collins after she loses if she "learned her lesson."

[comment]I’m afraid of polls.
[comment]While I think this poll has some flaw, this is how I think the race will end up, high single digit win for Gideon.

Again I think 50/50 in the Senate is quite likely.  Colorado, Arizona, and Maine are big trouble for the Rethugs.  And Cal Cunningham is a strong candidate who will outperform Biden in NC.  But after that things get pretty uphill.  If we want a working Senate majority, we're going to need a landslide where some of red state Senate races are in play.<|endoftext|>

We can't go on like this. We just can't.
[comment]Super predators
[comment]One light at the end of this tunnel that I see: the end of the Republican Party. Having totally thrown in their lot with Trump, the party will collapse like a used condom when he's finally gone, one way or another. The GOP has made a mockery of its previous stances on fiscal responsibility, balanced budget, family values, etc, etc. What will be left to say after Trump's gone? "We're sorry, we were out of it, we feel better now, can we play again, please?" I doubt Americans will buy into that after all the hypocrisy &amp; lack of moral fiber that has been demonstrated by the GOP and its leadership in this era.
[comment]You mean like how you're now haunting Bernie Sanders for helping you lose the election? (and, yes people, I am a Democrat who also supports Sanders and wants him to win... Like he would have done in '16!)
[comment]Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton and the "Democratic" elite are equally terrified of someone like Sanders or Warren coming into office.
[comment]Fuck. Its gonna haunt us all...
[comment]I hope they all get voted out and their party collapses.
[comment]i hope it doesn’t haunt *us.*
[comment]Lets keep asking irrelevant Hillary what she thinks about things.
[comment]Don't try to rationalize GOP actions as fear: They **support the Trump regime** and all of its crimes.  They're evil.  It's the purest reflection of their nature they've ever had.

The chaos his regime creates lets them commit crimes with impunity, and hope for even worse in the future.

[comment]Considering the movie is about the repressed working class and their struggle to survive, it did not matter what language this was in or what country it came from this nitwit would simply not understand the film.

[comment]I bet he wouldn't have any problem if 1917 won.
[comment]“Did this ever happen before” hmmm please elaborate Mr. Trump what didn’t happen “before”
[comment]The thing is though, that the movie isn't even woke in any way. It's just highlighting the greed and the class divide in Korea, so it offends Trump's Business persona, not his conservative, anti new age persona. This shows a growing fear among the rich as to the possibility of austerity.
[comment]I'm shocked he didn't mention The Birth of a Nation. The man is trash on the finest level.

Jesus, the world could be burning down and the media would still be playing these autistic games.

[comment]Hillary isn't perfect, but at least she's smart enough to not so blatantly break every oath and law. All politicians skirt the law to get things done sometimes, and that's fine, as long as most of what you do is legal and helps people. You can't just go around acting like the law doesn't apply to you, even if you believe it. You have to be smart about it, and nobody ever said Hillary wasn't smart. 

Hillary knows that as long as you're passing laws people want and that help them, they really don't care what you're doing behind the scenes to help yourself out a little. Like with Bill -- he could have screwed the entire West Wing and nobody would have cared, because the economy was great. That's how he got away with shipping all our jobs down to Mexico with NAFTA and passing that criminal justice law that put so many young black men in prison. 

Well, until all the factories closed down up north and people started getting pissed about it. Maybe Bill isn't such a good example of a sneaky liar.

[comment]Why are so many of you calling Bernies campaign over? A MAJOR crisis is happening right now that may shift perception of both Biden and Bernie. This is unlike any primary year.
[comment]As an Australian, the only place I can find anything positive about Biden is in this subreddit.
[comment]Not necessarily bad for for Biden at this point.  Trump, for all his buffoonery, has been able to dominate the media cycle.  Sanders is a senator, so he is getting some airtime.  Biden is essentially a private citizen, reduced to putting out Wayne's World style videos shot in his house.
[comment]Of course he does. He has nothing to lose as he has already lost.
[comment]I honestly don’t know what he’s thinking.  If the goal is to influence the platform, it’s better to do so by leaving on a high note, not spending the final months getting blown out in state after state.  Sanders is a good “idea guy” but he’s not an effective messenger.
[comment]God, he's beyond redeemable. A man who hates our party joins our party in order to start a revolution against our party that failed miserably wants to debate the defacto nominee chosen by our party? Just say no Joe.

[comment]The media hasn't changed at all.  It serves power.

It pretended Trump was a legitimate candidate, even though he clearly wasn't.

It pretended Hillary Clinton was some kind of opposite equivalent of Trump, even though the criticisms against her were trivial in comparison.

It pretended Trump was "elected," even though the whole goddamn world watched the coup unfold.

And now it's pretending other things in preparation to see Glorious Leader For Life Trump installed in power forever.
[comment]I have to say Hillary for bad press. But she didn’t help by not being genuine. She has always been very closed off and lacked self reflection. She came off as cold because she campaigned not to lose instead of campaigned to win. 

For better or for worse presidential politics is a cult of personality. The presidents of the last 40 years have been the person who presented as being a genuine person and showed their personality, flaws and all for the American public to see.

Clinton presented as stiff. And her lack of interviews didn’t help. She is doing more candid interviews now.
[comment]Listen to her interview with Howard Stern from 2019. If THAT Hillary had run she would have easily been president. I liked her before. I loved her after.
[comment]I always felt that her unlikeability was always a third party branding that worked really well.
[comment]The fake propoganda machine on the right made her out to be evil like Trump tries to do with everyone that opposes him.   How much better of a president would she be than the current one....
[comment]It's totally irrelevant whether she's likeable or not. What matter are policies and ideology.
[comment]I think that's only half right. By keeping Hillary on a tight leash, only doing certain kinds of media &amp; interviews, her handlers kept America from really getting to know her. Much of it seemed planned to avoid the overdone email questions that were so ubiquitous. It made it look to much of the public like she was hiding something. Her campaign didn't play to win, it played to not lose. Anyone who watches football knows that can be a foolhardy strategy.
[comment]Thank you ‼️
[comment]Amen. It's unreal to me how the press turned her into some sort of monster.

When she says that people generally dislike her when she's running for something, but like her when she's working, she's not kidding.
[comment]It's amazing to me how many people on the left still think all the debunked garbage about Hillary is true and call her "evil".
[comment]But none of those were major party presidential nominees. I am not saying all politicians have that skill.
[comment]The ones who aren't telling her to disappear are saying this, anyway.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defense-team-to-close-arguments-complicated-by-bolton-reports-11580215229[comment]😀 Best News I’ve heard in a while!
[comment]Nope. Sorry.  I refuse to get my hopes up.  I’m not letting Lucy pull that fucking football away again.  Not again.   Sorry.
[comment]&gt;The (3) senators said a drawn-out trial could lead to more Democratic attacks and hurt their re-election chances, the people said. 

Yea just forget that oath they took to ~~protect and defend the Constitution~~ act as impartial jurors.
[comment]I'll believe it when I see it.
[comment]It’s said we have to hope the right thing happens instead of it happening on its own.
[comment]Nope.  Sorry Mitch, not buying it.
[comment]I’d love to see those turtle tears.
[comment]Well.  Let me think.  We need four.  Romney and Collins both seemed interested in hearing from Bolton.  That's two.  Murkowski as well.  Three.  Pat Toomey floated a one-for-one deal to bring in Bolton and a White House witness.  That would be four.  But as a Pennsylvanian, Toomey is a snake and I don't trust him.
[comment]Is going to be 51-49 or 50-50 with a Pence tie break. We ALL fucking know it.  No one will protest.  We should be out in the streets by the MILLIONS. All the roads in DC should be shut down by millions to protestors.  The reason Republicans get away with all of this is because they are right about one thing: No one fucking cares enough to get cold, or wet, or do anything to remove themselves from Dancing with the Stars for an evening.
[comment]So when does the vote happen? Democrats should call for it now if they have the votes before McConnell and Trump strong arms them.
[comment]I don’t give a shit. Honestly. It’s all bread and circuses anymore, and it’s beyond the point of annoying that more people haven’t realized this yet.
[comment]Nah, no chance.  Collins is a pathetic loser who will vote against doing the right thing, as always.  Romney is blowing hot air too, he'll puss out and vote against witnesses in the end.  Murkowski will follow suit.  No chance.  The only thing you can count on is for these pieces of garbage to continue being pieces of garbage.  Nobody in the GOP cares and they never have.  It's all for clicks on a news article, as always.
[comment]Neat.


Keep applying pressure. Don't back off.
[comment]If this whole trial isn’t a blatant coverup, why would the GOP want to block witnesses?

[comment]"McConnell Says GOP Doesn’t Have Votes to Block Impeachment."

The usual slimy republican trick.
[comment]I'm not optimistic about this. I'm ready to move onto the election and vote them all out. 


Why? Regarding witnesses, what difference at this point does it make? 

Their defense has been thus far a journey into the narcissist prayer:

- "He didn't extort the Ukrainians."
- "If he did extort them, it wasn't like 'EXTORTION-extortion', it was more like 'extortationismology' which is different and not even a negative thing"
- "Ok even if it

[selftext]https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/12/17/half-of-active-duty-service-members-are-unhappy-with-trump-new-military-times-poll-shows/[comment]Criminal filth like trump would put his boot on your neck regardless who the fuck you are. Hands down, barr nunn
[comment]This is soo untrue
[comment]Most active duty dont read military times or (insert branch) Times magazines.  Most of the base papers and stars and stripes most dont bother with either because its mostly stuff around the base or things we knew about a week ago.  

"Polls" in general are pretty unreliable, especially online ones which doesnt verify if youre active duty or not.   But hey, if you want to spread it as fact, go for it.
[comment]only half? well, that seems to be accurate in relation to the overall national sentiment
[comment]That seems low but then again he is the Commander in Chief* so there may be some active duty personnel that feel compelled to voice approval without actually feeling that way.
[comment]The way he shits on the military, their leaders and their heroes, I’m surprised it’s only half.  Pray that he never sends them off to war and that they get caught.
[comment]Its more like masturbation, half the people admit to doing it, the other half lie.
[comment]Sad to say that this lines up with the “we’re heading for a civil war” theory
[comment]Should be 0 for Cap Spurs
[comment]Unhappy with the draft dodger?   I wonder why? Could it be that he has no idea what he is doing?
[comment]And the other half should be discharged.....
[comment]He’s going to get re-elected
[comment]The thinkers and officers in the military are already solidly anti-trump. They know he’s destroying our credibility and hamstringing our standing. If we nominate a good candidate like Joe Biden, I imagine we’ll win the military vote, which has been a GOP base for a long time.
[comment]Half is pretty proportional to the country. I'm actually surprised it isn't more, because he makes their jobs a lot more difficult.
[comment]This is so skewed. So roughly half of 1630 military personnel, out of over 1,000,000 military personnel. This is literally less than 1% of all active duty military.
[comment]What was Obama and Bush's approval rating for reference?
[comment]So President Bone Spurs, who was deferred from military service five times, who has no sense of sacrifice or allegiance to country, and who denigrated American war hero John McCain even after McCain spent six years in a POW camp but refused to leave when given the chance until his men were released first, is still liked by half of active-duty service members? WTAF?
[comment]I work in the defense industry, which a lot of people would probably assume is very pro-Trump/Republican. While people are normally very circumspect about discussing politics at work in our industry, I've noticed that people have really soured on him since the big shutdown last year.

That was a **huge** deal at my company, and while my company managed to cover expenses during the shutdown, a lot of federal employees and other contractors we worked with weren't so lucky. It was really bad, and everyone blamed Trump for it. 

Now on the extremely rare occasions that politics comes up in the office nobody *ever* has anything good to say about Trump. Probably doesn't help that he keeps fucking up global supply chains. Seriously though all our company wants is a normal President who will keep things relatively calm and business friendly. Trump isn't that.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]Lifelong Republican here. Trump lost my vote in November. His arrogance, lack of professionalism, low IQ, and "talking out of his ass" that the coronavirus is "under control" has lead to the death of thousands, and thousands more to come. Yeah, he put travel restrictions in place, but he didn't take this seriously, and still won't. His leadership at this time is pathetic, he should shut the country down, stop being an asshole to the press, take responsibility every once in awhile, and take this more seriously so other republicans do too. Hundreds of thousands will die because "he had it under control, like a miracle it will go away". COVID-19 has revealed who he truly is and I regret voting for him. He's an idiot.[comment]Welcome to the world of objective reality. Enjoy.

 .... we're screwed
[comment]Finally! Now he can do something in addition to waiting around for the rapture.
[comment]We are so fucked
[comment]Luckily he has experience in this stuff guys!

"The people are sick, let's send them to a camp with a few priests and God will cure their sickness," Mike Pence probably.

GG America

Maybe he'll pray the virus away lol pray the gay...pray the virus...pray for trump lol all the same to this lunatic!.

[comment]That seems like the Trump administrations MO. Take someone who has demonstrated they are incapable of doing a job, and give them the job.
[comment]Only the best people, folks
[comment]The really good news about all this is that if we continue the infighting, the Trump/Pence disaster will get a second term and this will all get a lot worse. Simply because no one could get the fuck over themselves and vote blue, no matter who.
[comment]Don’t worry pence will pray the coronavirus away.
[comment]Is there really any Trump supporters who honestly feel that Pence and Trump are the right guys to deal with this.

My only saving grace is that this is a global problem and that global leaders are working on this
[comment]To be fair, that was mostly about his abject disdain/bigotry towards homosexuality. Just like Christ?
[comment]Well america is fucked... who else wants to lead the free world ??

[comment]If it fails, at least 45* has someone else to blame. That will be a good enough reason to fire and replace him with either Nikki Haley or his daughter Ivanka.
[comment]No love lost for Pence but this is a pisspoor example of "enabling" the spread of HIV. 

In controlled environments (like hospitals and medical clinics), clean needles are virtually 100% effective in preventing the spread of disease. In practice (on the street, in rural, heroin prevalent areas), not so much. Very simply, the intravenous drug-using population is too high and/or too sick to adhere to an effective, antiseptic injection regimen. Clean needles come in packs (5, 10, whatever), and once the package is open the clean ones are indistinguishable from the dirty ones. To people without any experience self-administering injections of any kind, the thought of being extremely careful with needles seems like a no-brainier. This is not the approach intravenous drug users take towards their health. 

It is extremely disingenuous to claim that these deaths due to disease communicated by dirty needles all would have been prevented had Pence himself supported a clean needle program, and really seeks to turn the tragic deaths of these poor people into statistics to support a particular political point.
[comment]Mike Pence is a fucking idiot.
[comment]I’m sure he thinks prayer is the best cure
[comment]Never trust a man who calls his own wife "mother."
[comment]Astounding. Pretty much rolling out the welcome mat for mass infections. Response will continue to suffer. AND, with trump publicly putting pence in charge, it means with things go south (which they probably will), there will be a scapegoat. Trump will walk away (yet again) without repercussions while the rest of the nation, yet again, suffers. Simply astounding
[comment]Couldn't think of a worse person for the job, which is always Trump's point. Maybe this is his idea of edgolord  humour.
[comment]They’re playing themselves by eventually killing off the oldies that voted them into office in the first place
[comment]Pence will distribute lots of hope and prayer for those of us in areas that will be impacted by the virus.  I don't exepect anything else.
[comment]HIV isn’t his his fault, it’s a sexually transmitted disease and if they get it it’s their own goddamn fault
[comment]Well the orange orangutan always said and to this day still says he has the best and the brightest people in his administration, this is just another one of those best and brightest people that he's talking about. And if you believe what I just said you're either one of his cult followers or just a straight-up dumbass hahahaha.

[comment]The reason that Trump can’t say what he thinks the crime was is because it would be “Obama improperly tried to get dirt on a political rival to influence an election.”

Which is what Trump was impeached for.

He also can’t say it because Obama didn’t do that—none of this information came out prior to the election.

We have the dumbest president ever, we really do.
[comment]I can admit the facts, that top Obama Administration officials did unmask the fact that Michael Flynn was contacting the Russian Ambassador in direct violation of the Logan Act, but that isn't particularly a crime.

To think that there are people right now, as we speak, dying from a serious illness with little to no help from their government and this is what one half of their government is focused entirely on is just absolutely maddening.

[comment]Trump needs to control the news cycle every day. He cannot allow it to cool off.  So he's going back to the tool box. 

Trump will try to take up valuable time on newscasts every day because as long as the media is dutifully reporting Trump's fake news, they aren't talking about the 2000 Americans who are dying every day or the 80,000+ who've already died.

[selftext]https://www.theweek.com/speedreads/917538/democrats-raise-more-money-sunday-than-during-every-2020-primary-debate-election[comment]From Portugal, please remove that man. This is horrible for the whole world.
[comment]You’re welcome
[comment]And a lot of those dollars are Republican dollars from fed up Republicans I bet.
[comment]Let’s hope it’s enough.
[comment]Every dollar donated to Democrats is a dollar wasted. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the Democratic party is filled to the brim with enablers and "let's work with Trump-ers".
[comment]I think it should be noted that the last three months aren't necessarily good for the Democratic Party's chances of taking back the White House. Often disenfranchised voters don't vote Democratic: they just don't vote. People who feel unrepresented by the system don't vote. People who feel that neither party will change things for the better don't vote. And the Democratic Party does a lot at the local level to chase police union support.

There are a lot of people who believe, "he's an idiot who's wrecking the country, so Biden's a shoe-in for 2020." But then, that's what they said about Bush vs. Kerry in 2004.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Fox News is worried about legal action after misleading viewers about coronavirus
[selftext]https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-worried-about-legal-action-after-misleading-viewers-about-coronavirus[comment]let's bankrupt them
[comment]Fox News needs to be bought out and all its employees given non compete clauses for 20 years.  Then the company needs to be liquidated.  Just completely uprooted and then dismantled.  

Fox News and it’s copycats are unamerican degenerate propaganda for degenerate troglodytic invertebrates
[comment]Trump already said 200K dead would be a good result. So I’d expect at least that many based on whatever they finally showed him that got him to listen, possibly the refrigerator morgue trucks gathered outside his childhood home’s local hospital.
[comment]Sue the fuck out of them. Sue then into bankruptcy. Sue then into oblivion. Sue them into irrelevance.
[comment]I'm out of the loop here and could not find the original article about what is happening. Could someone summarize it for me?
[comment]Fox News license should be revoked. They have a license at the pleasure of the US citizens. They have abused their privilege for far too long. It's time to revoke their license.
[comment]if my 75 year old parents get sick, I am pressing charges against  Fox News for man slaughter, in my parents get sick.   My parents have told me directly that because they believe Fox News and Fox News is telling them its not a big deal.  I believe that the media is in position of authority and should be held responsible.
[comment]The Murdochs better be worried! They enabled every damn failure of this stable genius!!
[comment]So should the rest of the media, their approval rating is like 13%.
[comment]I hope Rupert Murdoch has nightmares every night of being in court the rest of his miserable ugly life over this.
[comment]The reason fox started moving to cover the corps was that Rupert Murdoch was prohibited from having a huge birthday party for himself. He then decided to let his anchors cover it, but downplay it significantly.
[comment]I’m not as optimistic as other commenters that this situation is finally going to wake up the Fox News crowd. They’re really good at playing to their base and spinning information, even when they’ve been caught blatantly misleading people about something, they still find a way to spin it as being someone else’s fault. I truly think they’re responsible for trump being elected and not being removed from office because they’re so good at getting people to rally behind their carefully crafted worldview, creating an entire culture of people who live their lives by misinformation, who then go on to support politicians who buy into and peddle the same false narratives. It would be an incredible display of justice if Fox finally suffered consequences for all of the lying and intentional manipulation of public opinion that they’ve been engaging in, without consequences, for so many years.
[comment]Good! They should be. I hope they are sued into oblivion.
[comment]Sue them into insolvency.
[comment]They basically yelled out that there was no fire in a theater when there really was an inferno.
[comment]What about the 5 million other lies they've told?
[comment]They are worried about legal action when they should have been worried about people dying because of their lies. They don’t care about their own viewers, only the money they make off misleading them.
[comment]Sue them, they have deserved this before but now the biggest Trump Thumper of them all is glibly tampering with people lives.

On the other hand if you’re one of those people that only listens to Fox then maybe you just reaped what you sowed.
[comment]Let's grab them by the covefe hey ? Karma...

[comment]Karma Rupert dahlink.
[comment]No one in the comment's even clicked the link
It's literally a convo between Joy Reid and Gabe Sherman....that means nothing.

Brainwashed fools.
[comment]And they should be worried. If they assisted in people getting killed over false information they should be taken off the air and sued into oblivion...
[comment]Sadly, I don’t think it is an issue. Fox has been misleading viewers since mid-80s. If legal action works, they would have been bankrupt and shutdown for uncountable instances in the past. In addition, Fox is currently the designated propaganda channel for the current administration, DOJ will protect it until a democratic president takes office (if it will ever happen again).
[comment]They always mislead viewers.<|endoftext|>

Consider signing and sharing to show your support and rally behind  this idea!

[comment]He just likes it since he’s a Trumptard, and it exposes our grandstanding.
[comment]I don’t think this is a good idea. This will play well with people who are already agreeing that Trump should be removed, but it will just further embolden Republicans who are claiming it’s some partisan exercise. I don’t see how this can help us win over anyone who doesn’t already agree with us anyway.

If you think somebody who’s already thinking that Trump is getting railroaded by partisan Democrats is going to change their tune when they read that they’re not passing the articles on to the House, I think you need to remove yourself from your partisan bubble.

It was a great move to impeach Trump. It needed to be done. But this won’t help anything and could make his base even more energized come November.

[comment]If Mitch McConnell stubs a toe three times a day he wouldn't really notice it because elves feet are very callous.
[comment]Trump and the GOP were complaining since day one that he wasn't getting a fair trial, then Moscow Mitch flat out stated he wouldn't be a fair juror, so Nancy is just making sure he gets the fair trial he was so desperately looking for.
[comment]The House should look into Trump's emoluments violations and tack that article of impeachment on to the list in 2020. They can deliver *all* the articles of impeachment to the Republican Senate some time in 2020 when it's most inconvenient for them.
[comment]Are we sure this is it and not an attempt to sabotage Bernie and Warrens campaigning efforts in Iowa right before the state caucuses?  Just sayin worth a thought. Convenient that Biden and Pete would be helped by this.
[comment]Maybe the hold up has something to do with the Supreme court having to hear his appeals in the three cases on March 2020.
[comment]Color me skeptical.  Mitch and Trump aren't rational or moral.  They will gladly pretend like there is no impeachment as long as the articles aren't delivered.

The Democrats are the ones that wanted to push things through by the end of the year.  Trump and company were glad to let the courts settle things, which would take months and months.

<|startoftext|>[title]If you watch Trump this week he looks dejected, as if he is thinking how this could happen to him. He doesn't care about any of us. Not even his base. He is no leader. He should just resign if he knows he can't cope.

[comment]He has the virus and looks sick
[comment]He hasn't even ONCE mentioned having any sympathies for the people afflicted with COVID-19 or have lost a loved one.  The man is severely emotionally/intellectually/developmentally impaired and fails as a leader.
[comment]Coping means you have a strength that enables  holding on. 
Trump is weak. He isn't coping. Ivanka tells him  he is. He isn't. I look forward to the bastard completely losing his ****.

[comment]The fastest response  ever since Obama left him in such bad shape.

[comment]It's insane how awful things have gotten to the point that Pence being President would be a huge relief. At least he is literate and capable of taking in new information. But it could be the difference between millions of deaths and tens of millions of deaths worldwide, or hundreds of thousands vs. a million plus in the US.
[comment]He can't resign because he'll be subject to finance crimes in NY state. He needs to win so the statute of limitations runs out and he can't be prosecuted.
[comment]Id respect him 100% more if he resigned.
[comment]Being President aged Barrack like 20 years. Even when you are doing the worst possible job you can do it probably is stressful. When you have to rate yourself you are stressed and lonely.

[comment]If we really look at this. Tariffs led to a protein shortage in China forcing the market to offer protein alternatives like wild meat. Ok the Chinese government banned imports from the US in the midst of a swine Ebola that removed millions of Chinese swine from the markets. The US banned certain imports from China. Thankfully not trump ties or Ivanka hand bags but the Chinese reaction did impact imports of US pork to China hence leading to the “wild meats” in local Chinese markets. So in a convoluted way our fearful leader is ultimately completely responsible. But rated his response a 10 when he is solely in a large part responsible for the mess we find ourselves in.
[comment]It would be nice if we could focus on substance rather than aesthetics. Trump's policies and appointments have always been where 99% of the harm originated, and it's far easier to convince people on the basis of issues rather than hectoring and moralising.
[comment]You are right. 

I remember a coworker had a saying : "Lead, follow, or get the fuck out of my way". If he can't do the job just leave.  Pence can pray for Donald.

[comment]Donald Dump
[comment]Exactly what I was saying the whole time. He doesn't even care about his base. He can watch his supporters burn alive and wont bat an eye while counting the bills in his wallet.  

So if he doesn't care about his base, and obviously no one else, then what is his role in our government anymore? 

To be honest, the reason why I classify myself as an independant/apolitical is because I'm not really as smart or experienced as many other politically motivated people. I don't know what economy works. I don't know what type of laws or ideals lead to a better or worse society down the road. 

But I just want someone who isn't dismissive, arrogant and irritating that will do something. Whatever it is just someone do it. 

In my personal opinion, I think action is better than constant dead lock due to fighting between Democrat and Republican. So far the only economies I know about I learned in a textbook. In my eyes, I think why not try something, anything and see if it works. If it turns out bad then use the other sides ideas. Whichever one works the best then let's use it.

But I feel like the reason why it hasn't happened yet is because political party clashing prevents anything from happening and thus now no one can see who's ideas are better for the country. 

Am I wrong? Don't we all want to achieve the same goal which is make a better life for people? What middle ground is possible?
[comment]He sees the writing on the wall. Even he knows he fumbled this one in his own end zone. The universe literally gave him an opportunity to be a hero as we have no choice but to look to our government right now. Except he set himself up for failure so hard and he can’t actually handle it so he’ll forever be cemented as an absolute failure even to the people that didn’t wanna believe it before. And he’ll have no way of rationalizing it in his head either.
[comment]Exactly, Its hard to believe that there are people that actually still support this idiot!!
[comment]Why does he look dejected, I thought he was bragging about the economy not so long ago.
[comment]All he cares about is the market.  He is deluded when he says "there's tremendous pent up demand" and that will somehow magically make everything better.  Never mind that only 50% have any stock market exposure at all, even if it rebounds 20% it will still be in the shitter.  

Meanwhile in a month or two there will be countless millions who haven't worked in weeks and with so many Americans going pay check to pay check they will have no money for food and have to resort to begging or soup kitchens.  Rent payments will not be made, mortgages will default, cars repossessed, people will be evicted.  Property crime will spike and we'll either see marshal law in places or vigilantes.  People of color will of course be scapegoated for this "foreign virus".  Without anyone shopping tens if not hundreds of thousands of small businesses will go bust and millions will be out of work.  

Even worse people will be dying in droves because they are sick at home and can't get to hospital and even if they could the hospitals are full and have so few respirators that 90% of those needing them will be triaged to die. Many, many families will lose much loved elders and immunocompromised members of their families. 

And there Trump sits, smugly thinking throwing $700B at banks and billionaires will magically cause the market to uncrash and everything go back to normal again.  Meanwhile the rich will get richer and the poor get poorer because the rich have huge disposable assets the can throw into a rebounding market and make bank.  And his base?  They will still love him and swallow all the bullshit, lies, and Soylent Green he feeds them.
[comment]He was outclassed by the job on day one.
Ref- trumps comments - exiting day 1 briefing
[comment]I’m going to go out on a limb and say he and Pence are absolutely tired to the brink of exhaustion and terrified about this virus. He has a lot of lives in his hands and he knows it. Show some sympathy.
[comment]Saying can't stand the man is an understatement for me. He walked into a relative slam dunk of decent economy, world relations, etc. We need a leader NOW. Not tomorrow, next week, now. We don't need someone who is more interested in saying he takes no responsibility and while taking the credit for having a stellar response. If it didn't portend bad tidings for the little guy who won't get bailed out, it was almost laughably pleasant to watch the stock market nose dive while he was talking today. We went from we have it under control two days ago to this won't be over until July or August.

[comment]Pelosi for President. Pence and Trump gotta go together.
[comment]Is anyone else CONVINCED he is lying about his negative test result?! 
I think he “cares” all of a sudden because it’s impacted him personally. He can’t see past his own nose so either he or one of his kids had tested positive. I’d bet my hat!
[comment]This is because Fox News is telling him it is bad.  Not because the CDC or WHO, or his own intelligent services.
[comment]Keep Trump in office please, I don't want to live in a counter with any more Christian indoctrination. Pence will make sure we'll need to pray more to rid ourselves of the virus.

<|startoftext|>[title]Opinion: Black millennials who refuse to vote are falling for a political fraud
[selftext]https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-17/donald-trump-black-voters-election-politics[comment]I know too many Black men who do not vote because they are disillusioned by the political system.

I try to encourage others to vote but it often falls on deaf ears.
[comment]I don't think it right to point out any one group and accuse them of committing greater offenses, crimes even, if they don't do X (vote in this case) compared to other groups. It is discriminatory and not worthy of the Democratic Party for which this is clearly trying to appeal.

I do think everyone ought to vote, but if you aren't interested in politics, if you don't know the issues, if you don't understand them, if you live in a deep red or deep blue state, etc. all factor into whether or not it even matters. You shouldn't vote if you don't know anything about politics, parties or the candidates.

In California (this was from the LA Times) the Democrat will win - period. In truth, voting itself is irrational at the individual level - but rational at the collective, societal level. If you are in a swing state - then your vote is worth a lot more than the votes of most Americans and therefore you have a greater logical incentive to vote.

I'd personally say voting for a 3rd party candidate is a vote for the major party you dislike the most. Not voting, regardless of race or other identifying characteristics, is a failure to live up to the obligations you have as a citizen of a  democratic society. Yet, I think it dangerous to point out any one group and claim they are uniquely problematic if they do not vote.
[comment]To their detriment.
[comment]When people tell me they don't really like politics, I tell them people have devoted their entire life to making you dislike politics.

[comment]Any millennial who refuses to vote is failing themselves. If you feel you are a persecuted minority of any kind, then you should def vote. 

Don’t be stupid. No, no one is here to coax you and tickle you until you act in your own interest.
[comment]No one should not vote because the system sucks.  If you don't vote , you contribute to the system sucking

dont be brainwashed by ads, or rogue news channels or websites - use your mind
[comment]Eh. I’m split on this. I think everyone needs to realize that they can’t sit out if they want meaningful change, but the amount of shit minorities get through voter suppression efforts is really something. Makes me really glad that we have people like Holder and Abrams on our side to fight for fairer elections. A personal thought, though; why is the focus only on blacks? Hispanics vote at a lower rate and don’t get articles like this. I’m hispanic, and none of my siblings have ever voted in an election. It sucks, but hopefully this time I can help get a couple additional Dem votes.
[comment]Voting should be a national holiday and two days long on a weekend. That short time democrats controlled House, White House and Super Majority Senate they should have enacted this.
[comment]I have a different opinion. We should make sure everyone has a reason to vote. If people aren't voting, it's because the politicians don't appeal to them.
[comment]Voting should be a requirement to maintain benefits for non disabled, or keep your citizenship 🤣
[comment]maybe theyre just apathetically stupid...theres that possibility...millennials aint the brightest lights in the room...
[comment]So the Russians silenced the black vote in 2016? This article misses the mark by a decent margin.  Hillary Clinton was uninspiring and heavily flawed.  That's why black millennials voted third party or stayed home.  

Turnout would have been sharply better had Bernie been the nominee, especially among black millennials.  Every poll indicated it to some degree<|endoftext|>

Thanks.
[comment]Well, you removed the only people that could have stood in his way.

Even Republicans have said that they would have voted for Tulsi Gabbard...but no you all HAD to have Biden.  Hell I am a Trumper and even I would have thought twice if it was between those two.

She is :.

1. A veteran ( republicans \*\*love this\*\* )
2. Suspended her campaign to serv and then restarted once she was back from duty ( republicans have wet dreams about a candidate like this!\*\* )
3. She is young and fit, not just cute. With Biden and Trump can you say that they will last 5 years or survive the coronavirus if they get it?
4. She some supported limits on abortion ( Again, she would carry republicans ) 
5. Does not like foreign wars after having to actually be in a warzone as a marine.

Compare those thoughts to Biden or Bernie.

You Idiots!

[comment]I just cannot conceive this man's greed. There's just no end to it.

I mean, you've got money. You're set for several generations. You don't have to work ever again. 

You've got your condos, hotels, Mar-a-lago, the brand and golf courses. I know the bottom has fallen out of the realtor market. But if you sold at any time, you would still make enough bank to buy God's foreskin and pay off Jesus' mother to sign a PDA.

Why keep on f'ing over the entire world over? You born into money. Why keep acting like it's running out?

I can understand the Kushner family. They're basically f'ed from making that stupid purchase with 666 building.

But Trump?
[comment]Are you crazy? Your just saying things. No sources, no arguments. The man’s in worth $2.1bn, he has a gold toilet ffs. The federal government is crazy in debt there’s no money for him to take, even if he wanted it..
[comment]Great intellectual response my friend. Im curious as to the time frame it will take to create more of your brilliant insights.
[comment]I really hope Biden makes some kind of attempt to right the ship if he wins in November. The country can't heal if politicians help sending the message that rampant corruption incurs no punishment.

[selftext]https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/04/the-death-of-iowa-110655[comment]Agreed. I've never been big on starting with a caucus, but this just is ridiculous.
[comment]&gt; “This will probably be the last caucus we’ll have to worry about,” David Yepsen, the longtime Des Moines Register scribe and dean of the Iowa press corps, wrote on Twitter.

Wow 

And then the article goes into to say the GOP may keep it, but was still “despondent.”

I mean if it kisses away IA for the Dems, that’s bad in the National, but give it to OH, PA, NC, MI. 

More electoral votes in the national and I would wonder what the GOP with their primary would do as a result of the Dems were spending so much of the year in PA for example. That would be a huge advantage
[comment]The primary system has been broken in the US for decades and it's why we get candidates that don't reflect the general population's desires. 

Live in a big state like NY and by the time the primary vote comes to you, there are no choices on the ballot because only one candidate is left. 

Mix up the process and order every year so every state, big and small, get a chance.

[comment]For decades, the person who got the early lead in the process was nothing more than the person who could promise the most ethanol subsidies. I don't know why everyone was ok with this in the first place.
[comment]Sanders of course is partially to blame for this. The Unity Commission changed the rules in response to his last series of baseless conspiracies, creating the complex reporting mess that caused last night. 

And he’s declaring victory due to the confusion he himself created.
[comment]Nation-wide primary vote with ranked choice voting. Everyone votes at the same time, the best choice rises to the top. No state gets to be in charge of setting the course of the race.
[comment]Fantastic to let it fuck things up this go around though... amirite? Why have a solid red state start anything off for the D's? That is just plain stupid.
[comment]it’s humiliating. if you’re an American paying 0 attention to politics it’s pretty hard not to agree with Kelly Anne Conway’s tweet “Can’t run a caucus. Can’t run a country.”
[comment]I'm a Trump supporter and will never get tired of winning.
[comment]&gt; Since 1976, both parties have held their first presidential nominating contests in Iowa, and **the Iowa state legislature passed a law saying that its caucuses need to be held at least eight days before any other nominating contest.**

https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/why-iowa-and-new-hampshire-go-first

There's a law in Iowa to go first...so...they **will** go first next time.
[comment]When CNN was discussing Pete's victory speech something they said stood out and is more of the reason why Iowa is not as critical as advertised. They said the Caucus was 95%+ white, Pete might do well with that group, but his test is how will the other more diverse states treat him. Small part of the overall story is all Iowa is.
[comment] Iowa should NEVER be first again...ever.
[comment]Total, 100%, ridiculous screw up. And why in the hell does anyone think the first actual voting mechanism should take place in a completely unrepresentative of the American population state?!  I’m a 73, retired and a Veteran who loves my country but hates everything trump.
[comment]It should be a regional primary. Iowa/Wisconsin/Ohio/Indiana. Then new England then Southeast then everybody else.
[comment]Why don’t the states rotate who votes first in the primaries?
[comment]They need to get rid of the over complicated caucus system completely.
[comment]Completely undemocratic.  It’s a bad joke.
[comment]Iowan here. Good. Send those fucking parasites (from both parties!) somewhere else.
[comment]I remember years ago (2004 or there-abouts) there was a push for the primaries to be reformed for smaller states to go first in one lot, then larger states, then larger still and the largest last.

Iowa and New Hampshire would still be near the beginning as they're small, but they would need to exist with other smaller states at the same time, states that have a far greater diversity (NM, DE, HI, SD). Yeah there will be some whiter-then-white in the mix, but it will still be better then these two states having such an over-influence on things.
[comment]Why is everyone blaming the state and not the party?

[comment]When trump always does that, it's a pretty safe bet. 

I predict the ocean will be wet tomorrow.
[comment]Hope so, last time he did the two handed reach for his water and I thought he was about to croak.
[comment]if conway's right, i can hardly wait.
[comment]Just imagine just as trump starts his "speech" Nancy just waltzes up and hands him the impeachment paperwork during "his moment" and talks over him for the camera about his being impeached.
[comment]What do want to bet he'll step up sniffing away, almost as if he was high on something. Oh wait.
[comment]this isn't a prediction, this is a simple statement of fact.
[comment]I wouldn’t doubt Pelosi is banking on it
[comment]And his base will,    
A) Love it.   
B) Not see a problem with it.    
C) Wonder why he doesn't arrest Pelosi while he's there.    
D) yeah, all the freaking above...
[comment]Especially if the articles haven’t gone over to the senate
[comment]Of course, and the republicans won't stop applauding...
[comment]That seems like a safe prediction
[comment]Democrats need to taunt him and help bring out the maniac. Let everyone see him on full display. This should solidify them with independents
[comment]I wonder if the Dems have the courage to yell "YOU LIE!" at him? I doubt it, and that's a big part of their problem.
[comment]Youtube will break if he does.
[comment]I hope so.
[comment]What’s new?
[comment]State of the Union (SOTU)
[comment]Anyone who says Pelosi doesn't know what she's doing just needs to STFU, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the fuck out of it as she finally pushes him over the edge literally live in front of the entire nation as he loses it publicly because she refuses to send the Articles to the Senate until the traitors agree to an actual fair trial and will keep adding more until he does. Impeach, Rinse, Repeat. It takes a lot of cleansing to remove shitstains.
[comment]It will probably be over by then because Pelosi won’t be able to hold off that long. McConnell and all of Trumps Republican stooges will acquit him and in Trumps mind that means exoneration. He’ll spend most for the address crowing vindication and how the evil Democrats attempted to overthrow the greatest president in all of history. Oh...and the beautiful wall is almost done.
[comment]The Democrats have made a joke out of impeachment
[comment]I'd say that's a safe bet
[comment]This is different from his other SOTU speeches, how exactly?
[comment]i’m glad I don’t have to sit through it
[comment]It is almost a certainty that it comes off as a rally vs SOTU. These are the moments that define Presidents, can you speak to the people and convey that you represent them even those that would never vote for you. This is going to be an us versus them moment.
[comment]Maybe Miss Nancy will require him to send it in writing, instead.
[comment]I’m thinking the same thing.  He will be unable to concentrate on anything with the Speaker glaring behind his back! I think Nancy has set him up nicely!
[comment]I've always thought that if you take a very unflattering picture of Trump, showing his fat ass playing tennis in his tidy whities comes to mind but there are many many others, and just put that picture on billboards around Washington and Florida that he has to see them and the meltdown will go nuclear. Just a thought.
[comment]As opposed to his unhinged, delusional, narcissistic meltdown over some other perceived slight.
[comment]Trump will not go off script for SOTU. he’ll slur his words and mispronounce things, but he’s not going to go off script and start ranting.

You guys do know that George Conway and Kellyanne Conway are a social media influencer power couple, right? This isn’t some marital feud on full display. He’s saying things he knows liberals will like. Everyone should stop paying so much attention to him.
[comment]Nancy Pelosi has as much right to do this with the Articles of impeachment as Mitch McConnell had when he denied Obama the ability to name a new Supreme Court Justice and 140 other justices Across the Nation.<|endoftext|>

[comment]The status of the economy is not necessarily reflective of who’s in office. The economy was already improving before Trump got elected, and it has continued doing so.

[comment]Even after counting the unpaid Garret's and the Lisa's.  Its a small portion, but still they are counted.

Who is counted as employed?

People are considered employed if they did any work at all for pay or profit during the survey reference week. This includes all part-time and temporary work, as well as regular full-time, year-round employment. Individuals also are counted as employed if they have a job at which they did not work during the survey week, whether they were paid or not, because they were:

* On vacation
* Ill
* Experiencing child care problems
* On maternity or paternity leave
* Taking care of some other family or personal obligation
* Involved in a labor dispute
* Prevented from working by bad weather

These people are counted among the employed and tabulated separately as *with a job but not at work*, because they have a specific job to which they will return.

Not all of the wide range of job situations in the American economy fit neatly into a given category, however. What about the two following cases?

* Garrett is 16 years old, and he has no job from which he receives any pay or profit. However, Garrett does help with the regular chores around his parents’ farm and spends about 20 hours each week doing so.
* Lisa spends most of her time taking care of her home and children, but she helps in her husband's computer software business all day Friday and Saturday.

Both Garrett and Lisa are considered employed. They fall into a group called *unpaid family workers*, which includes any person who worked without pay for 15 hours or more per week in a business or farm operated by a family member with whom they live. Unpaid family workers comprise a small proportion of total employment. Most of the employed are either wage and salary workers (paid employees) or self-employed (working in their own business, profession, or farm).

In addition to estimating the number of employed people, the survey collects information about the job characteristics of the employed. For example, the survey gathers and provides data about workers’ industry and occupation, hours worked, usual earnings, and union membership.
[comment]Yet, he’s going to win again because the Democratic Party can’t produce a worth candidate or find a message that will apply to the majority of Americans. Thanks DNC.
[comment]Donald Trump is a con artist.
[comment]Look at unemployment though, it’s not like things are getting worse in terms of job availability
[comment]I'm a longtime southern Democrat and I honestly have to say he will be getting my vote this time around
[comment]Funny thing is that the job numbers are put out, and revised downward 2 months later and have been since he took office. His spokesman inadvertently spilled the beans early last year. Dimwit Donnie has it done so he can brag then when caught, uses the line fake news. Most of media overlooked and didn’t report it then because he was bitching about mueller, and everyone else as he does. Blows me the maggots could give a damn about anything he does.
[comment]Not surprising, this man wouldn't know the truth if it kicked him in the balls, oh wait, you gotta have balls first!!!!
[comment]And yet, the unemployment rate is the lowest it has ever been. Hm... Who's telling the truth?
[comment]The fact that jobs *happened* while Trump's unelected puppet regime occupies our government isn't evidence he "created" them.
[comment]Because there were less jobs to create. We have more jobs than people, of course he wouldn’t create as many. This is about as basic as it gets, is it that hard to understand?
[comment]But it still created jobs right ?
[comment]No surprise, I mean, what is Trump actually doing on a daily basis??  Nothing!!  He has his hours of "executive" time, a few photo op, meaningless meetings with world leaders who suck up to him but privately laugh behind his back.  He golfs and rakes in MILLIONS of tax dollars into HIS pockets.   He holds his lie-fest rallies &amp; stiffs all the towns for a $100,000's for HIS security!!  He doesn't read any of his daily briefings, he doesn't understand anything, he has NO vocabulary, no education, no nothing but unending greed &amp; vindictiveness.  So how COULD this waste of air accomplish anything, let alone creating jobs?
[comment]Why don't you compare Obama's first 3 years with trumps last 3 years
[comment]Obama's 1st 3 years we lost jobs.......
[comment]And it's probably only going to go down.
[comment]To be fair, Trump didn’t have as large of an unemployed population in 2017 as Obama in 2014.  Makes sense job growth would slow the closer we move towards 0 unemployment.  If you look at unemployment rate to job creation trump has a higher ratio.

You can pick stats to prove any point if you’re smart about it.  Not saying one president is better or worse.
[comment]That's a stupid point. Yes, Trump's policies suck, and yes, the economy is not working for the middle class. 

However, the recovery started with Obama, so of course he has seen higher job growth. This is not surprising at all, and really says nothing about the economy, neither good nor bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Obama to endorse Biden for president today
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/obama-endorses-biden/index.html[comment]This is a big fucking deal!
[comment]**Here is the text for those who dont want to click the link**    

&gt;(CNN)Former President Barack Obama will endorse Joe Biden on Tuesday, a source familiar with the plans tells CNN.

&gt;Obama will make the endorsement of his former vice president in a video message, offering why he believes Biden is the candidate needed at this moment of crisis in America, a person close to the former president says.

&gt;The endorsement reunites the former running mates and positions Obama, whose endorsement of Biden was seen as a forgone conclusion once Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race last week, to be one of Biden's most powerful surrogates in the race against President Donald Trump.

&gt;It also marks the public re-emergence of Obama into the political arena. The former president kept a low public profile throughout much of the Democratic nomination fight, but he was active behind the scenes.

&gt;Two people familiar with Obama's video say it is intended as more than a simple endorsement of his friend and former vice president. His message is designed to address this particular moment in America and around the world, particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt;Obama will acknowledge how frightened people are and explain why he believes Biden is the right person to lead the country in this time of crisis, the sources said, and the candidate who must defeat Trump.

&gt;Obama will also speak directly to progressives, praising the spirit of their movement before outlining why he believes they should embrace Biden's candidacy. The former president will also offer a full-throated praise of Sanders and noting what his candidacy has meant for the pursuit of liberal ideals.

&gt;Obama in November said he had spoken to all of the candidates during the campaign, often giving them advice both before they announced their bid and after they dropped out. Advisers to the former president said his advice was often the same: Consider why you believe you should be president, what impact it will have on your family and whether you can actually win.

&gt;Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race

&gt;"We have a field of very accomplished, very serious and passionate and smart people who have a history of public service," Obama said at a private fundraiser in late 2019. "Whoever emerges from the primary process, I will work my tail off to make sure they are the next president."

&gt;Obama had long said he would get behind the eventual nominee, but the former president's deep affection for Biden was well known to all those who ran against the former vice president this year. Biden even jokingly posted an homage to Obama on "Best Friends Day" in 2019, featuring a friendship bracelet that featured the names "Joe" and "Barack".

&gt;That relationship, though, did not keep Obama from giving counsel to other candidates.

&gt;As Sanders worked to determine the future of his campaign, Obama and the Vermont senator spoke multiple times, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. Sanders endorsed Biden on Monday in a livestream, pledging to help him defeat President Trump.

&gt;"We need you in the White House. I will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe," Sanders said to Biden.

&gt;In the few moments where Obama did speak out about the race, the former president warned voters of worrying too much about the bruising nature of a primary, reminding them that he and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton had a tough primary in 2008.

&gt;And the former president told the candidates to avoid going so far left that they go beyond where voters actually are.

&gt;"My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are," Obama said in November, specifically saying he doesn't think candidates should be "deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven't heard a bold enough proposal."

&gt;It is this period of the campaign, however, when some supporters of other candidates, especially Sanders backers, feel like their hopes were dashed once their candidates dropped out, where Obama's team believes the former president can be most useful.

&gt;"He is uniquely positioned to galvanize the party around the nominee and increase voter turnout so that a Democrat is successful in the general election," Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, told CNN in March.

&gt;Jarrett said that they believed it was "important" to let all the candidates "stand on their own two feet" but that once a nominee was selected, Obama would use the support he enjoyed from a "a broad spectrum of the Democratic Party, both the progressive and moderate wings" to bring the factions together.

&gt;Obama's popularity inside the Democratic Party was clear throughout the presidential campaign. A number of candidates ran ads featuring either images of Obama or the former president's voice, including Sanders, who had in the past been critical of Obama.

&gt;But the extent with which Obama can reach out to Sanders' supports is questionable, given many of the liberal leader's most vocal proponents see the former president as someone who squandered the movement he built in 2008. Even former Obama aides question how successful he will be in reaching Sanders' more diehard proponents.

&gt;Biden was not shy about his admiration for Obama throughout the 2020 campaign. Biden often described himself as an "Obama-Biden" Democrat and, in speeches across the country, would calmly refer to the former President as "Barack," sometimes before correcting himself and calling him the president.

&gt;The former vice president even used part of his first major rally as a presidential candidate in 2019 to laud his former boss as "an extraordinary man."

&gt;"I watched up close, his character, his courage, his vision," Biden said. "He was a president our children could, and did, look up to. ... He was a great president."

&gt;This story is breaking and will be updated.

[comment]Hope we see this for all Ratpublicans up for re-election clean house!
[comment]Bet she's getting "concerned" now probably on the verge of being "troubled"
[comment]This is a good sign but I would like to see the gap a little bit larger because I would imagine Susan Collins is going to have a huge advantage in terms of name recognition than her opponent.
[comment]I thought she said she would retire!?
[comment]How is she only trailing by 1%? How can so many people STILL support her? How is the margin not higher?
[comment]Bye Bye Susan, your immoral dirtbag
[comment]This is the way.
[comment]Maybe one day we’ll learn to put her name (Sara Gideon) in the title
[comment]McConnell and Graham need to go too.
[comment]Good. Vote them all out
[comment]She has never done the right thing, it's why she is Republican.
[comment]Good. Fuck her.
[comment]Just donated to Sara Gideon. Fuck Collins.
[comment]As as as as she should should! “I I I thought Trump would would change change”. Please how much money did he give you!  She is a sell out vote her out!!!
[comment]Good. See ya bitch!
[comment]She looks like a character outta Bewitched.
[comment]Paybackproject.org   She needs to go! along with the other 9.
[comment]Seriously we should go to Sara Gideon's webpage and donate $5. This is a huge pickup.
[comment]*Happy tippy taps*
[comment]Donate five bucks to her opponent. I did. Fuck Susan Collins
[comment]Woo hoo!!!!
[comment]Time to double down on those donations!
[comment]Come on Maine vote Susan Collins out of office maybe she'll have to take a perp walk from the Senate just like they made the good man lieutenant colonel vidman do from the White House. If Susan Collins does take a perp walk there's a real reason for it unlike lieutenant colonel vidman he didn't deserve what he got nor did his brother or anyone else involved in the impeachment of the orange man / orangutan.
[comment]Good.  Her "concern" is fake just like all the principles that the GOP say they support.  Vote them all out.
[comment]Bye Susan. Felicia can stay.
[comment]Good. Fuck her.
[comment]It is too early to be a threat.  Although the fight is starting early in Maine.  It appears that it will be a great match.
[comment][Donate to to her opponent, Sara Gideon, here.](https://saragideon.com/)
[comment]$5 coming Sara's way from Dallas TX!
[comment]The only reason they acquitted Trump was to save their seats. Perhaps a big miscalculation and there could be many Republican senators sweating right now.
[comment]Couldn’t happen to a nastier person.
[comment]I really hope trump fucks everyone in the party out of being re-elected.  Such sad, pathetic times.
[comment]Good she’s a spineless loser who plays games lets get her out
[comment]Every republican who stood up for Richard Nixon lost their next reelection campaign by roughly the same margin the had won it in the previous election. Spinless party promotion over the countries best interests does have consequences. How members of the Senate and US House of Representatives don't have at least 1 staff member who knows this is simply mind-boggling.
[comment]Well... I'm sure she very disappointed about that.
[comment]Hallefuckinlujah!!!
[comment]Couldn't happen to a better person!
[comment]Sara Gideon. The challenger’s name is Sara Gideon, goddammit.
[comment]She is a horrible person!
[comment]She's a spineless hypocrite and I hope she gets the heave-ho.
[comment]Excellent!
[comment]Do you think she learned a lesson from this?
[comment].... how should a Mainer vote?

Steaming pile of dog shit?

or

The Democratic Candidate......
[comment]CSI OPENING: YEAHHHHHHHH!
[comment]Excellent
[comment]Byeee Felicia
[comment]Good. Let her learn
[comment]Good!

<|startoftext|>[title]Hillary won every demographic besides white people making over 50k/yr. If anyone's been left behind by the system, it's her supporters. Trump's supporters are mostly white evangelicals. "The system that left them behind" is democracy.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/edoverbeek/status/1199046243957104645?s=21[comment]100% true
[comment]Winning in the demographic isn't enough. Bernie's key point here is that many poor white voters, especially from the rust belt, either didn't vote or voted Trump. A majority voted Hillary, but it is clear enough voted Trump that she lost the rust belt. Bernie can get those voters.

&amp;#x200B;

Also,  "The system that left them behind" is capitalism. The greed left them behind, and the failure of the US's system, which claims to be democratic, but is mired with rich money.
[comment]Her only downfall was that she is a woman.

How many more thousands would it have taken to overturn the Electoral College.
[comment]Email
[comment]"White people making over 50k/yr" is literally the description of the electoral college
[comment]I’ve never blamed millionaires for voting in their best (tax) interests. I’ve never understood people making 50- 200k also voting in millionaires best Interests.
[comment]Trump has did more for this country than most other presidents no matter your skin color, your religion, including the LGBT community. believe what you want but I'm a American a Christian and a conservative I love my country and I love my president. You didn't see us trying to impeach Obama for everything thing he said or did now please show a little respect for the president. If you respond please tell me why y'all have so much hate for our commander and chief.
[comment]America is a religious state bordering on theocracy.

How are you so far backwards?
[comment]I wish this fact got more coverage. The richer a white voter was, the more likely he or she was to support Trump.
[comment]Our system is Not democracy as a relative continually tells me. Hillary won by three million votes. We need a constitutional amendment. Or a revolution.
[comment]I spoke recently with a life long evangelical family member. Hates Trump. Doesn't like how he disrespects women, the military  (especially McCain ), and just the overall nastiness of the man. If you want to start a dialog with someone &amp; you're not sure where they stand, say something like 'but yeah he does tweet a lot'. You'll know in seconds how they feel.
[comment]Bernie would have beat Trump.
[comment]What about the majority of eligible voters that did not vote? What do their demographics look like?
[comment]I think that is an oversimplification. While I agree that there are some obvious differences between those who would support Trump or Hillary, I think the bigger story is who stayed home. Those are the people who feel left behind. Not even half of eligible voters showed up. We don't need a top-down approach to solve that problem either. We need a solidarity approach to solve that problem. What are the demographics of those who stayed home and those who didn't even bother to vote?
[comment]I'm pretty sure that's 50k combined household income.....which is a ton of white people voted for trump
[comment]This is not true,why do people on Reddit believe these lies?Search it up.
[comment]I’m a white man who makes over 50k a year and voted for Bernie.

Hoary was too right wing for me...yes she’s a democrat, but she is still hawkish on foreign policy.<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/kushner-cleans-up-remark-saying-hes-not-sure-he-can-commit-to-election-being-held-as-scheduled[comment]Trial balloons...it’s their plan to stop a fair election...just has they have always done.
[comment]Clear as Kushner.
[comment]He has no legal authority. None. 
The election doesn’t need his commitment to happen. 

That being said you can already see what POTUS is trying to do with his comments regarding mail in ballots not being allowed to count. 
The GOP and POTUS are going to try everything they can to maintain their power. The courts are going to be busy ruling on a lot of proposed voter suppression related tactics that the GOP will use to disenfranchise voters. This is a calculated plan on their behalf.
[comment]WTF? The federal government doesn’t control the elections nor when the president has to leave office.
[comment]Why did the president's Eskimo brother get a security clearance?
[comment]His family has a proven ability to be above the law as this administration continues to function and aspire to be authoritarian, so these remarks are troubling to me.
[comment]Bet they have the Constitution printed on the ass-wipe in the Whitehouse..
[comment]Well then I guess I'm not sure we can commit to not throwing him in jail.
[comment]Why should anyone care what this punk-ass rich kid says? What are his credentials? What does he contribute to society? Nothing.
[comment]This dude said last week that we defeated coronavirus and can move on to other things. Now it will effect an election 6 months away? 

Strange
[comment]Let's reschedule the election just for Jared. He can "vote" two weeks later.
[comment]Slumlord Kushner should be put in prison just like his low life father.
[comment]Yeah Kushner I am going to need you fuck to the off right about now.
[comment]If the election doesn’t go forward as planned trumps term expires anyway and Nancy Pelosi becomes president. Trump doesn’t have the authority to stop this election so Kushner certainly can’t do anything.
[comment]The election must occur if he wants a chance of staying in office as if it doesn't then the president and his vice president are removed from office anyways by the constitution automatically.
[comment]Kushner is more or less the president right now. The next AG needs to scrutinize every single action this dip dingle has done in the last few years.
[comment]The Fuhrer has made him top Nazi, and he has absolute authority until we all actually do something about this hostile fascist takeover.
[comment]He has none, along with brains.
[comment]Kushner KNOWS shit about Trump, for sure. Like the most disturbing, horrible, incestuous stuff you can imagine. Trump lives in fear of the guy because he could destroy him. He leverages this to run the government from the shadows and he’s every bit the narcissistic, silver spoon failure-upper his father-in-law is. I’m amazed every day that this isn’t a constant story in the news.
[comment]&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't have any authority over the election if trump cancels or tries to postpone it he will go straight to jail as per the constitution THIS WON'T BE FUCKED WITH!!!
[comment]Forget about what legal authority he has because we all know he has zero, zilch, NADA, none whatsoever I just want this question answered WHO THE FUCK DOES HE THINK HE IS? THIS FREAKING DWEEB, THIS SOFT AS COTTON LITTLE FUCKING BOY WHO WOULD CRY FOR MOMMY AND DADDY IF HE EVER HAD TO GO OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD.
[comment]Isn't there a deadline for having the election? I was pretty sure the deadline is written into the constitution. There is no question about what happens if somebody were to cross the deadline. Not sure why Kushner is not taking a deadline like that serious. Crossing a deadline like that cannot end well. Americans take our deadlines very serious.
[comment]He looks like the mannequin with makeup on to make him look human
[comment]Kushner HAS NO AUTHORITY OR POWER SO NEITHER TRUMP TO POSTPONE ELECTIONS.. HOPE PELOSI PUT STOP TO ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
[comment]Cuomo cancelled the NY election. That precedent.
[comment]If the election is delayed, there should be a revolution, the fed should be overthrown.
[comment]Go ahead and log off for me Kushner
[comment]Trump’s 4-year term expires in January. Cancelling or postponing the election won’t keep him in office. Without an election, his term will simply run out and he and Pence will both have to leave office. The 2nd in line in the Presidential Succession is the Speaker of the House, so then Nancy Pelosi would become President.
[comment]I’ve already requested my mail in ballot online for VA.
[comment]Who cares what Paul Reubens has to say.
[comment]He has an opinion. That's it. No one should have given his opinion any notice because his opinion has no impact, power or control over what *will* happen.
[comment]Time to resist a tyrannical government that’s overreaching.  Where all my tea party People at?
[comment]You can't fix stupid.
[comment]No legal authority.  But I so desperately want to see him as the drag queen that bone structure deserves to be.
[comment]Why do they hate America so much?
[comment]He’s your impotent boy king in waiting and don’t you forget it.
[comment]What does he have to do with us voting? Who is he? Wait are, aren’t these the guys that want us to go back to work? So why can’t we vote?

<|startoftext|>[title]Fifty Thousand Americans Dead from the Coronavirus, and a President Who Refuses to Mourn Them
[selftext]https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/fifty-thousand-americans-dead-in-the-coronavirus-pandemic-and-a-president-who-refuses-to-mourn-them[comment]Where is the empathy? Where is even the inkling of understanding that this is fifty thousand FAMILIES whose lives have been unexpectedly upended with loved ones torn away from them, dying alone surrounded only by plastic sheeting and beeping monitors as they struggle to gasp their last breaths.. knowing that their end is here.... their bodies then stacked in hallways and  chairs and mobile cooling trucks parked on the street. These families won’t be able to gather and mourn, comfort each other, or celebrate those lives lost or properly say goodbye to their grandmothers and uncles and husbands and sisters. These families are also struggling to pay rent and find food and necessities and wondering if they’re going to lose their house or car too. — where is that sorrow or sadness or grief that our countrymen are needlessly dying in numbers beyond our greatest tragedies... 9/11, Vietnam... where is the comfort? Does he even know what we are going through? No. He does not. Nor does he care, because the rating for his briefings with incoherent ramblings about injecting bleach in our lungs are higher than the finale of the bachelor.
[comment]Just give their relatives some ice-cream tbh
[comment]Classic Republican not caring unless they're directly impacted.
[comment]I don't follow him closely because he makes me ill, but not once have I heard him express sympathy for the deceased, suffering, and their families.
[comment]Just to put it into perspective, more Americans died from COVID-19 yesterday than died from the attacks on 9/11/01.
[comment]Not even the lame a f "...thoughts and prayers" bullshit from this POS. 45 is the worst.
[comment]He wished Kim Jung Un good health though.
[comment]"More people die from the flu every year." Well these are people dying on top of that. These are people who *didn't* die from the flu season we just had but who did die from this.
[comment]People don't need words and drama. People need action. Not huge corporate bailouts, peanuts for the peasants, and a premature end to an already loose lockdown. That's the elephant in the room nobody wants to address.
[comment]If only the Republican senators had done their jobs a few months ago .  The House did theirs

Think about how many American lives would have been saved with different leadership
[comment]Lysol.  

By three o'clock he will say he never said the stupid shit he said yesterday because he knows there's a third of this country that will ignore it ever happened if he said so.
[comment]Anyone else see a leadership void in the news reporting too, though?  I usually watch PBS Newshour because in the past they had pretty much focused on facts and stayed away from “breaking news” and sensationalism, but in the trump era, even Judy Woodruff just keeps repeating the stupid stuff trump says.  Last night’s show was a low for that news program. I know it’s hard to not take the low hanging fruit, but we really need someone to rise to the occasion and provide actual newsworthy information to the public. Leave trump’s latest dumb comment to the political news outlets.
[comment]This is beyond the point of obviousness that this con man isn't qualified to be the President of the United States. He should step down immediately, including Pence, and let someone capable of leading to LEAD!!
[comment]They should have eaten tide pods like he instructed.
[comment]I've seen zero emotion from Trump during this whole thing.  Andrew Cuomo's briefings in NY are what I watch daily, and you can see the pain in his voice and face as he talks about the deaths.  Trump not so much.  I hope this will open the eyes of every voter when they vote in November.  And I hope everyone who wants to can vote by mail -- that's something else the GOP is trying to stop.
[comment]A serious lack of empathy.
[comment]Fuck le fatty trump
[comment][50,000 people used to live here](https://youtu.be/RRYmVb33VU0)
[comment]So important people need to mourn for those who died? I think he has better things to do than mourning.
[comment]This is on the heads of everyone who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[comment]50k is getting close to 20 9/11s and 10k bengazis. .
[comment]People are asking where is the empathy this POS doesn't have empathy you should have known that 3 years ago, and none of this matters to any of his followers these people are so fucking blind and foggy eyed that they not just can't see how bad of a person their dear leader is they don't want to see how bad of a person their dear leader is. That is the definition of a cult following the followers do not question the dear leader and everything the dear leader does is ok and everything  the dear leader says is the truth, even though they are mostly lies it doesn't matter to the dear leader's followers because that is his base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]One Democratic Senate staffer mourned the apathy. “Our phones aren’t ringing,” he told me. “Nobody cares. It’s the saddest thing ever.”
[selftext]https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/opinion/sunday/trump-senate-impeachment-trial.html[comment]I'll keep calling my senator (Toomey), but this is so discouraging. For anyone else who is calling their senator - have you had any productive conversations with staffers or do you just stick to a script?
[comment]Why would you call your dem senators?

It’s the gop senators whose phones are ringing off the hooks. You can’t even get though to Cornyn or Cruze. The lines are busy and the voicemail boxes are full.
[comment]Typical NYT.

#BidenJacqueline2020 !!!!
[comment]I’m not calling my Democratic senators because what else are they going to do? And I’m not calling my republican congressman because I have lots of times before to be completely dismissed by some college kid intern. He obviously and arguably, actively doesn’t care about his constituents. I do call his Democratic opponent, I go to town halls and debates and I donate money. We’re not apathetic but there’s not point in preaching to the choir.
[comment]I already trust my senators to do the right thing. I guess I could call them to say good job! But I’d rather re-elect them instead.
[comment]They shouldn't be surprised that most Americans only call when there's a problem. Right now our problem is not with the Democrats
[comment]HMMMMM wonder who that is because I called my Democratic Senators this week and was told that the phones are ringing off the hook!
[comment]It’s not that we don’t care it just that the process is out of our hands now.
[comment]I don't think it's apathy in the subject it's being jaded by the process. No one I know doesn't care. They just think Republicans have no spine and won't do anything about it so they've lost faith in the system.
[comment]Maybe they shouldn’t have been calling for impeachment from the day he took office then. Now he actually did something so bad and they can prove it nobody has any outrage left.
[comment]I called both of my Senators in support of witnesses testifying. But, my senators are Grassley and Ernst so that was a waste of minutes.
[comment]I called my GOP Senator. Leaving any type of msg or VM was not an option. Told to go to website where you get generic response bot email to any complaints.
[comment]The democrats don't need the wake up calls, and the republicans aren't picking up their phones.
[comment]Every time i get upset about something i donate to a democratic challenger of these traitors. My bank account doesn't like it but its the only way to feel any control...
[comment]Is it really apathy or well deserved cynicism over the apparent prearranged result of this "trial"?
[comment]My senators are Warren and Markey. What do you want me to say to them?
[comment]Seriously...I have two Democrats for senators.
[comment]Kinda clickbait title...who is supposed to be calling Dem senators?
[comment]At some point, the Democrats have to take winning and holding the Senate seriously.
[comment]Unless it's Jones or Manchin, why would you feel the need to call them? We expect them to do the right thing.
[comment]It's not that no one cares. Everyone knows the score. #moscowmitch will see that trump weasels out of the charges. 100%. So....why bother.
[comment]I call my 2 Rethuglican senators every other day. Why the hell would anyone call dems?
[comment]I call my republican senators every day.  I only have republican representatives.  Who the hell else would I call? We know who is going to vote which way..it’s not the democrats that need to be spoken to.  This is the dumbest quote.
[comment]I called the other day, and I was put on hold, then transferred to a live person. I'm in SF, CA, so, any call I make, is kind of pointless. Write a letter to Red state senators. It's the only way they'll get it if you're not a constituent.
[comment]Let me say sonething that I'm sure all of you already know, if we as Democrats, independents and Republicans but more importantly as Americans that voted for this guy (I didn't) in 2016 but now realize that he is a danger to our country and to all Americans and even to the world, if we don't all band together in 2020 and vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who he or she is then we're going to have more years with this deranged lunatic and it will only get worse and if you don't want to vote Democrat then just don't vote I'm sorry I even have to say this because I'm not a doctor but I'm thinking he suffers from some type of chronic disease that will only get worse with age. Like Maya Angelou said when someone shows you who they are believe them the first time and the people who voted for this lunatic did not believe him the first time but I hope you got your shit together now and believe who he really is, and that's a danger to our country, all Americans and the world. Vote DEMOCRAT IN 2020!!.
[comment]We know how this is gonna end. No amount of phone calls is going to mean a damn thing.
[comment]Or some Republican staffer was talking some shit, and wants us blowing up the Dem’s phones. A better question is why weren’t sycophants of this shit show blowing up the Dem’s phones, hmmm ?

I wrote the house managers ( emailed ) to thank and congratulate them on a stupendous job !
[comment]I don’t have a Democratic senator. Therefore, I’m not going to call them. They don’t have to listen to me.
[comment]Call Dem Senator and say what exactly?
[comment]Uh, okay, I guess. I am a voter who cares and also expects my two Senators  to do the job they were elected to perform. I shouldn't have to call them to remind them of their duty to preserve democracy and defend the Constitution from all threats, foreign and domestic.

<|startoftext|>[title]Trump Budget to Propose 'Savage' Cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, &amp; Social Security While Hiking Pentagon &amp; Wall Funds - "This budget is Trump's pledge that as long as he stays in office, slashing Social Security, Medicaid, &amp; whatever's left of SNAP will remain a White House priority."
[selftext]https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/02/10/trump-budget-propose-savage-cuts-medicare-medicaid-and-social-security-while-hiking[comment]At this point, I’m not at all sure I’d care if Trump straight up had a heart attack and died. If that sounds horrible, oh well. Only death will make him stop. He always does his worst and lies about the rest. His followers are little more than a brain dead bunch of morons who could care less what he’s doing, as long as their party is in power, their ideals are represented, and they get to “own duh’ libs.”

My Mother, just like everyone else who pays taxes in the US, has paid into SS her whole working life. She relies on SS and Medicare to survive. That miserable sub-human piece of waste said he wouldn’t touch “Entitlements,” as he refers to them. We all know they are what people deserve, because it’s THEIR money! He’s going to try to cut them, anyway, because it’s what his puppeteers want. Fuck him, fuck Republicans, and fuck every enabling piece of garbage in his God forsaken, morally bankrupt administration.
[comment]Nothing like cutting off the poor , elderly,and disabled while giving your friends tax cuts and building your war machine .. Sadly his followers effects will believe it’s what’s best for the country .
[comment]I know once those cuts are made they will never be replaced.

The only good part of this is it might kill off some of the Fox News voter base that much quicker.
[comment]Since he isn't crowing about this his supporters don't know and won't find out until it happens. Even then though like the farmer they will stay behind him as long as he keeps spewing hate.
[comment]Any details on the cuts?
[comment]Go for it I guess. I applaud them for doing what we all know they wanted to do.
[comment]He lied at the SOTU bigly.  I live in a very rural area that is very Trump.  They don’t like to admit they screwed up voting for Trump but cutting SS and Medicare and Farm subsidies will affect everyone.  I mean any smart politician would never announce cuts like these during an election year.  Trump is so arrogant he thinks we are all a bunch of rubes and will vote for him anyway.

Wake up America
[comment]This needs to be attached to every single election across the country. 


A republican in the house or senate will pass this budget.
[comment]Here's what I hate the most about all this:

It's changed me. 

Now, I never really cared about politics for 83% of my life. Then, 10 years ago, I met a friend who has become family. That person, John, was ALWAYS politically active. His whole immediate family is. They have paid attention when I wasn't, fought for programs I used when I didn't, supported teachers when I thought they were fine.

But a decade ago, I was shown the excessive waste of military spending, the government contracts that line the pockets of "elected officials", that they were "elected" through gerrymandering and voter suppression.  I was shown the myth of the Welfare Queen, the disproportionately affected and segregated poor due to flat-out racism and greed. I read the criminalization and weaponizing of an herb, that was shown for millennia to be beneficial to the medical community, for racists ends. And I found how how much all that succeeded, and exactly how fast.

And it changed me.

I want to protect the poor, because greed has made them, and greed has cherry-picked them specifically to be the poor. But if you are a Trump supporter, I'm done helping your ass. Everything he does, he does because it benefits him, and that is nothing at all like the Supporter cheering for it. 

Millions of lives will be turned to the worse now that his power is unchecked. And I see this Administration as the Xenomorph to Weyland-Yutoni. Everyone thinks they can weaponize the monster for their own ends, destroying everything in their path because "they control the monster."

But do they? When tRump comes for their Senate seat, they will turn to Mitch, who will say, "That's not my problem." Then they will be out and a crony will be in. And that will happen over and over, until Mitch alone is left. Then, tRump will want something that cuts into Mitch's interests. Maybe it will be doing away with parties at all and having only State sanctioned appointees to
[comment]Fuck Trump.
[comment]Let's not even pretend that the GOP cares about the average American at this point.  Screw it right.
[comment]Just like Jesus /s
[comment]America and the rest of the world are under attack by this man and his criminal friends.  Is there no patriot within an arms reach of him?
[comment]Let him do it. Let him fuck it all up! Of course he’ll still find a way to blame democrats for the increase in homelessness and unemployment rate. Not to mention the number of uninsured related deaths. God it costs SO much just to live here! I almost want to check out early to avoid growing old here because that costs even more!!
[comment]Why does Trump HATE Americans so very much?
[comment]In all honesty these cuts should pass. The majority of his base and red states will suffer while the majority of blue states will find a solution to take care of its citizens. 

The only bad thing is republitards will start a massive influx migration to blue states. Then they will demand changes in democrat local governments trying to have what they ran from.
[comment]/s  Thank you so much to all those stup.... no scratch that... manipul ... no people don't like to be called that either ... uhhh... fooled ... OK ... misguided ... yes... people that voted for Trump or did not, for whatever reason, vote for you know who.  Can't say her name because this would upset some people too and probably be voted down.

[comment]The dumbass Republicans who vote/d for this subhuman species don't understand that social security and Medicare are NOT ENTITLEMENTS(although they use that word to make it look like it's a giveaway) they are ours WE PAY INTO THEM you DUMB ASS MOTHER TRUCKERS for drumpf. When you get to the age that you may need THEM you dumbass motherfukers won't be calling THEM entitlements anymore, that is if they are still there when you may need THEM!! You're right wing troll subhuman dear leader is not just trying to screw with Medicare/Medicaid and social security your subhuman dear leader is also screwing with the affordable Care act, for the right wing idiots that don't know the true facts and probably don't care about facts and the truth, it's your dear leader Donald j drumpf who is the piece of shit that's trying to take away coverage for anyone that has any pre-existing condition/s it's not the Democrats, just ask yourself this why the fuck would the Democrats try to take away pre-existing conditions from the insurance policies we are the ones that fought so hard to get it, I mean you guys can't be that stupid,deaf and blind to really believe the Democrats are trying to do this?!! Please someone tell me that they aren't that stupid. But I don't think anyone can tell me and that's really sad..

<|startoftext|>[title]Why Pete Buttigieg Enrages the Young Left.
[selftext]https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/01/pete-buttigieg-enrages-left-liberals-2020-091479[comment]This is interesting and actually makes me like him a bit more. Mayor Pete maddens me because of the last election. It makes me crazy that a man can get this far with no experience. Of course the ass we have as our president now also has no experience but is that what we are going for?
[comment]This article comes close to realizing the point and then misses it completely.  It’s about some left-right spectrum.  It’s about money in politics.
[comment]The young left does not trust those whose campaigns are largely financed by Wall Street. Any other young lefties are welcome to chime in.
[comment]Because he's a bought and paid for political hack, just like most of the others?
[comment]Why &lt;Anyone not named Bernie Sanders&gt; Enrages the Young Left.

Literally put any candidate name in this title and the result is the same.  It's why the young left tore down Kamala with Racist and Sexist lies and attacks.  It's why they tear down Warren.  It's why they tell lies about Biden.  It's why Sander's supporter gleefully went all in on Pizzagate, and Benghazi, and Hillary has a brain tumor and killed Seth Rich with it conspiracies.  

Just look at the people posting shit about Pete in r/politics and here.  Look at their histories.  They did the same thing with every candidate, some going all the way back to 2015 posting Seth Rich conspiracies.

It's not Pete, it's not the Democratic field.  It's them.  Trump cultists and bernie cultists control to much of the conversation, and their hearts are twisted with hate and bile.  Just look at this fucking article that pretty much only quotes twitter, as if twitter is real life.  

I have yet to see anyone Prove that Pete's funding is from "wall street", or what the even means.  His platform is decidedly left wing, but they call him republican.  If you ask them what policy he has that is even close to republican, they just say "okay boomer" or dox you, or downvote you into oblivion.

But luckily, unlike their last few victims Kamala and Warren, Pete seems to shrugging this off.  And they still haven't pushed Biden down, who has been in the lead since before he entered the race.

The "young left" are mentally diminished malcontents that simply worship a messiah.  It's sick.  They are no different from Trump supporters.

It's all about their messiah and the cult of hate they belong too.  If Buttigeig falls in the polls and someone else rises, they will cut that person down too.
[comment]I think the huge privilege that Pete Buttigieg has that no one mentions is his Christianity and Military Service. Both of these things are often used by the right wing (and many centrists) as a way to indicate who the “real Americans” are. 

Military service (prior to the repeal of DADT) is incompatible with an open and honest life for LGBT folks, in order to be a military veteran, Pete had to lie about himself and hide his spouse from his coworkers. This speaks to Pete’s ability to stand up for the truth.

Christianity is literally the enemy of LGBT folks, they have been trying to strip us of our rights for longer than I have been alive. How anyone can be a proud Christian while also being gay speaks to Pete’s willingness to compromise what he believes to be right, to go with the crowd. 

I feel like Pete Buttigieg is a huge sellout to the LGBT community. We do not need to be veterans or Christians to have a seat at the table. If people can’t accept us for who we are, then those political institutions should be overturned. We shouldn’t sneak in the back door and pretend we are part of the crowd.

[comment]Pete got 2% of black vote. He needs to bow out after South Carolina.
[comment]Here's an idea: since Bernie Bros hate the Democratic establishment, why don't you create your own party? You could call it "the socialist party."

Sorry. I'm a Democrat. I won't vote for a socialist.
[comment]Feel the Bern! 🇺🇸✊🏼🔥
[comment]This is well-written and is not attacking Buttigieg, but  is attacking Buttigieg's argument, which you can read more about in the article.

Read the article.

Bernie has won over many, many people, seems to be growing the electorate. He won Nevada, and 41 percent of the vote was from new caucus goers.

Attacking him as someone who wants to burn down the party is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Sounds like Mike's not a big fan of The Donald which makes him alright in my book.
[comment]I remember Stop and Frisk.  Not gonna vote for him.

But.  This did make my opinion of him, his campaign, and his motivations, shoot up dramatically
[comment]I have my opinions of Bloomberg but he deserves credit for this if he follows through. Trump has to go
[comment]I will be voting for him in the primary.
[comment]Gonna need all the money the dems can get. Sux that campaigns are run on money but look at how much foreign ruble Trump has gained.
[comment]I mean I love this. We can use all the help we can get, but is it legal for a third party to pay for staff? How does this work?
[comment]good on him
[comment]I agree with other posters I have my own thoughts on Mike Bloomberg, but if and when he does this he's got my respect for doing this. Other than that I still think he should've stayed in the Republican party, just a thought.
[comment]Didnt he use prison labor as a call center? Could this play just be to get good PR?
[comment]Bernie would never
[comment]No campaign should accept.
[comment]Translation: If I can't buy my way into the presidency, I can buy my way into someone else's.
[comment]Im just happy this is bugging the shit out of the dummy.
[comment]Does this asshole do anything besides write checks? That’s his solution to every problem.
[comment]Anything to get more votes.
[comment]We’ll see about that
[comment]What I like about Bloomberg is that he hasn't smeared or attacked any of the other Democrats. He's focused on Trump.
[comment]Compare Michael Bloomberg to Shelton Addelson who got a 600 million dollar tax cut and immediately kicked back 100 million dollars to the Republican Party.
[comment]Bernie Sanders has entered the chat.
[comment]If this is/stays true Bloomberg just became my current #2. Now I just need to research his policies.
[comment]Whoever? Let's pick any Democratic thing, from billions. Whoever, whatever, whenever, wherever, whyever, however.
[comment]$100 says he goes back on this promise after Bernie wins the nomination.
[comment]Cool, he can drop out now.
[comment]This is the first and only respectable thing Bloomberg has ever done. 

Let’s hope he actually pulls through and isn’t talking out of his ass. You know, like a donkey.
[comment]Trump keeps proving that he is the best president, maybe in history. It’s going to be a tough road for dems.
[comment]Bernie in the house!
[comment]I wonder if Bernie or Warren would accept his support
[comment]Uhhhh. That works I guess?

Could have put the money toward that without wasting it on his own run, but ok.
[comment]We have got to get Trump out of office. Let's take the help.
[comment]He could do this without running too.
[comment]I seriously, seriously doubt he would do this if it’s Bernie or Warren. Just being honest.
[comment]I hope the party rallies behind whoever the nominee is...

[comment]Actually, the numbers here are likely far worse than anyone knows since we're so short on available tests. Trump knows we're short but would rather have lower numbers than actually help people.
[comment]America First!
[comment]So much Goddamned winning.
[comment]Haven't you heard though? He doesn't agree that we have the most cases. Problem solved, whew!
[comment]Yeah, we kinda suck at this
[comment]HA! You don't that every country is as honest with the figures do you?
[comment]I mean, this isn't super a reliable stat since there isn't likely widespread testing in places like India or Botswana, and China is obviously underreporting their cases.
[comment]Extremely hard to believe China's numbers though.
[comment]Most countries do not test much though.
[comment]Orange don't listen, orange don't care, orange just wants continuous adulation regardless of merit.
[comment]That’s because we are testing more and actually reporting numbers. If you think we have higher numbers than China you are sorely mistaken. Stop spreading misinformation. Now downvote me.
[comment]china is lying, and we have done more millions more tests than any other country.
[comment]Tiger blood# winning #coffefe
[comment]This is true for confirmed cases but cases are going massively underreported in numerous places like Ecuador, Brazil, China etc
[comment]36% of known cases.
[comment]Hey is this garbage upvoted? It’s very clear that China has the most cases.

[comment]Only a scumbag with no conscience would use this crisis for his own political gain. But we already knew he is a scumbag, he's been telling us so for years.
[comment]Guess what...Trump does not give a damn!
He personifies the worst of american society and we put him in charge. He is all those thugish things we despise but due to our hipocrisy we pretend we don't care. With others it is the end of the world, but if it is Trump, that is OK.
We have to vote better next time, and that include having normal people candidate for office, like our forefathers envisioned.
[comment]Why is this narrative being peddled daily?  No way we have the most cases.  We just happen to report what we have truthfully. 

Stop with these threads. Waste of time on every level.
[comment]Would Trump administration develop more effective countermeasures had we known the real numbers from China early on?  In order to ask this question, at the least, you need to believe that Trump is capable of governing and leadership. Just by looking at what he’s done with the amount of data available to him, I have no confidence in him at any capacity to lead this nation. He surrounded his administration with people not qualified for the task at hand. That’s #1 in my book of leadership.
[comment]The Obama administration walked incoming Trump administration officials through a hypothetical scenario in which a pandemic worse than the 1918 Spanish flu shut down cities like Seoul and London in early 2017, Politico reported.

During the briefing, Trump administration officials were told such a pandemic would likely lead to circumstances such as shortages of ventilators and that a coordinated national response would be "paramount," according to documents obtained by the publication.  The Hill
[comment]To be fair, thats probably due to a lack of testing in 3rd world countries
[comment]https://i.redd.it/xi6jq0ldxst41.jpg
[comment]Using this site to make political points is stupid regardless of your political standing.  


I hate Trump with all my  heart but please refrain from using countries self reported statistics as evidence of anything. There are obviously alot of lies coming from plenty of countries. Deaths are reported differently (for example I read in Swedish news recently that UK, Italy, Spain and Netherlands only count deaths in hospitals, not in elderly care facilities).  


And even so, saying you're #1 based on these stats is also stupid. You're obviously twisting them to your own biased purpouse. There are countries with way more deaths per capita, wich is the measurment that counts here.  


Please stop making these stupid attempts of political points. If you want to make people change their minds about Trump make valid ones, not points that even a child can see is extremly biased.
[comment]Amen on a grandiose scale!!! He seems to think if he just screams stuff looking and loud enough we'll all start to believe it! I cannot even believe he still talks About "winning "when the death toll is over 30,000. There is no  "winning"scenario here.  No matter when or how this ends, we have only lost on every metric by which to measure success or failure. and Now he's urging his supporters to protest,  throwing the second amendment around as though it's the most important thing to society at this moment.... this man and all who follow him are straight up losers, and they'll never be anything more.
[comment]He must not be reelected or selected. Can't happen. Words defy me with this one...

The GOP is not a political party.  It's a Russian-backed, insurgent occupying force.

Until Democrats figure that out, there are going to be many years of "calling on" Republicans to do things, followed by Republicans laughing at it and doing whatever they please with impunity.
[comment]Graham can jump on that train as well, hell in reality all GOP senate members should if they vote against. The evidence is there. Impeach this asshole!
[comment]That’s like saying there’s honor among thieves .
[comment]I love "calls on". It means exactly nothing, to anyone, anywhere. People making noise to hear their own voices, I guess. Complete waste of time.
[comment]Apparently Mitch hasn't read this article. Also must not remember the oath he took. Patriot my ass!
[comment]Even with Chief Justice Roberts overseeing the Senate trial with rules set by Republicans during the Clinton impeachment, there isn’t much he can do to force McConnell to keep it an impartial proceeding.
[comment]They need to send this to an actual trial with judge and jurors picked from American voters. Otherwise it will be a sham just like they are saying.
[comment]Moscow Mitch doesn't give a shit about an oath.
[comment]Republicans already said that they don't plan on even pretending to do this fairly or to be unbiased.  They will not recuse themselves, they will not get rid of Putin or Trump.
[comment]Good. Democrats need to be running ads on TV calling out this disgraceful behavior. Republicans villainized Pelosi, Mcconell is 10x worse.
[comment]The whole impeachment is a big sham IMO.
[comment]If the Democratic leadership had any backbone, they should have locked up all those Trump officials until they testified. They didn't because they are weak or too blind to see that the lawless Republicans will continue to flaunt the law. It's almost too late. Will they suggest kindly that Trump step down when he runs for a third term? They are no better than Republicans if they do nothing but appear shocked and do nothing.
[comment]This isn’t a criminal trial, every senator is not impartial. This is just another dumb attempt that will fail miserably.<|endoftext|>

[comment]He finally made a speech (Mar 14 noon est) where he did not shift blame or attack any democrats

He still only thanks his loyalists - but he mentioned "and working with Nancy Pelosi" but did not thank her.

Just curious if bill passed contained  any sneaky things not related to Coronavirus

[comment]How can he possibly be re-elected, saying stuff like that? Wait, don’t answer.
[comment]Just a note, for anyone who didn't already know.

[Texas has vote by mail.](https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/reqabbm.shtml)

To be eligible to vote early by mail in Texas, you must:

* **be 65 years or older;**
* be disabled;
* be out of the county on election day and during the period for early voting by * personal appearance; or
* be confined in jail, but otherwise eligible.

Republicans are afraid.
[comment]And if we retake the White House and Senate, we need to bury them with that realization:

- Expand the size of the House of Representatives, which will favor a continued Dem majority and offsets the plains states in the Electoral College
- Admit several if not all of the territories as states. +2 Dem senators for each one you add.

The short-term effect is a prolonged Democratic majority to begin undoing the damage of the Republicans since the Reagan administration. 

The long-term effect, which I believe is key for the future of the country, is that the GOP will have no choice but to triangulate and broaden its appeal. We can’t go on with these right-wing lunatics who deny reality, and this structural change plus demographic changes will force them to moderate back to what they have been previously or cease to exist in a meaningful way.
[comment]We know
[comment]This isn’t true. Instead what would happen is that the Republican Party would be forced to adapt, and instead adopt a platform and political strategy that is actually majoritarian. The Republican Party would still exist, but it would be fairly different from the way it exists right now.

Although I’m probably just being pedantic here.
[comment]Parties would adjust their program. A two part system always converges to 50/50. Just like two ice cream sellers always end up next to eachother in the middle of a beach. 

See: Pareto optimum.
Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a situation that cannot be modified so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off.

[comment]I would be careful about relying on polls. Most polls showed Hillary winning in 2016 and look what happened there.

I think it’s great that we’re ahead, but let’s not allow ourselves to get lazy in 2020. If we don’t reach out to working class voters in the Midwest like we failed to in 2016, we will not win. Period.

[comment]I dont like trump at all, but I'm not opposed to every policy he proposes, the thing I cant get over is how obsessed he is with his image, and his constant bullying of people who question him.  I have people in my life who try and cause me problems, and for the most part I'm too busy to engage them.  Trump is the president of the United States of America,  I'd think his workload would keep him occupied enough to not have time to worry about things like polls and what people think of his 'tan' or how he eats steak.  Maybe someone should take his phone away so he can stop tweeting and focus on his job.
[comment]This one-term loser is going down hard.
[comment]Wow does fox not want viewers bec I doubt they love the polls either
[comment]I hope it's good for us if even Fox News has him losing.
[comment]What was the response of Fox News and of the pollster?
[comment]It’s not quite State Run Media... yet.
[comment]Facts and numbers are stubborn things. Viruses are even more stubborn
[comment]What a loser! Is he going to fire everyone who is against him? Like almost the whole America?
[comment]Ffs  lmao
[comment]I'll quote Lizzo...Truth hurts.
[comment]Narcissism. Just the most blatant case of all time. Instead of trying to understand the cause of any issue he always shoots the messenger.
[comment]If anything, this is a play to make sure his voters think his grasp on the White House is so tenuous they mobilize to vote. It could also be a play to convince Dems their vote isn't that important since even Fox is showing he will lose.

He's stupid like a fox.
[comment]This dude is a child. What an absolute embarrassment to this country
[comment]Lol that pic in the thumbnail is particularly bad
[comment]i mean, he was also supposed to lose in 2016. these poils are misleading
[comment]I'm concerned about the accuracy of all the polls that show each Democrat leading for the general election.  Right now each Democratic candidate is spending their money just to win the primary. The RNC has tons of money that they get to keep dry to use for the general election. It makes sense that the Democratic candidates would be ahead now since they are in effect campaigning. But when only one is designated as the nominee then they are going to get the full brunt of all that RNC cash being spent in the general campaign. That and the fact that in any election the incumbent is going to have an advantage has me very concerned.
[comment]Let’s just fire his nasty dumb ass instead!!!!!
[comment]Yeah we all know how good polls are with trump
[comment]I love the thumbnail photo, he looks like the spoiled little child that he is, who is not getting what he wants right now.
[comment]Maybe these Fox polls are a tool to scare them to make sure the trumpers go out and vote. Considering the expected democratic voter this election. Just a thought.
[comment]Fox news is not doing enough to protect Trumps fragile ego.
[comment]This made us laugh hysterically.

You can't make this garbage up.

Just.....wow....Fuck this guy.
[comment]Hard to fire away the truth trumbo, such a pathetic human...
[comment]Fox News praises him at every turn and he just casually calls them corrupts.
His allies are crumbling just like his little facade
[comment]Of course Fox has the worst polls, but just look at what they have to work with! Personally, I feel sorry for them.

[comment]He always fires the messenger of bad news. Nothing new here. He wants yes men, even if they lie.
[comment]Man. He so badly wants to be a dictator. 🤣
[comment]but wasn’t he doing badly in the polls when he took the whitehouse in 2016?  i mean, it’s obviously not a deterrent.
[comment]He looks like my mother in law in that picture.
[comment]He will find a way to cheat to win this election or dispute the results and the Republican Party will just sit there and do nothing.
[comment]He's such a giant baby.   Look at him.  LOOK at him. 

How do his supporters not see this?    I will never forgive them for this shit.
[comment]He can be behind in the polls and still win the electoral college, a la 2016, obviously. For FOX News to even publicize their poll, is nothing more than a prod to the base to maximize their voter turnout. He’s an idiot to criticize the polls, rather than lament to the base at his rallies that fact. He will probably change that tack once his handlers realize it as well. The issue is, we have to focus on swing states. At the same time we have to emphasize how important it is to elect progressive down ballot candidates all the way down to dog catcher.
[comment]Don’t worry.  Bernie will lose the nomination and his base will vote for Snoopy or something, and we’ll see 4 more years.  OR Bernie will get the nomination and 3/4 of older voters, including democrats, will be terrified into voting against a socialist.  Oh, and the youth vote won’t turn out, no matter what, just like it never has in all of history.

It’s crazy how much paper waste there is from snail mail as well. 

Sincere question - what is the modern case for keeping USPS?  What people or use cases is it serving that digital and FedEx can’t do equally well?
[comment]You forgot a zero in there popeye. Each person would need to donate ~110...not 11.
[comment]Send your parents or grandparents a card or letter in the mail! They would love that and you’d be able to use those stamps!!
[comment]Done! (I needed them anyway)
[comment]I’ll buy a book tomorrow.
[comment]I bought two, so whoever can't afford one -- I got you, fam. :)
[comment]Ordering now. USPS is awesome, even when the majority party pulls every dirty trick to try to take them down, they persevere.
[comment]How about charging for stamps to use every time you send and email?  Yeahhhhhj!!
[comment]I bought $33 worth yesterday!
[comment]I've been trying to order stamps for the past hour, the USPS store is down! A good sign I should hope!
[comment]Bought $25 worth last night, I probably won't use them anytime soon but glad to help stick it to the Republicans.
[comment]Bought two books this morning.
[comment]Ooh, just found a batch of Disney villains postcards and stamps!
[comment]grand idea, but the problem is that the Federal Government has consistently been plundering the USPS for years. If everyone did as you said, they'd just take that money and funnel it elsewhere.
[comment]Hey people! Are you tired of starving with the given corona lockdown?

So are we!

Luckily for us! We've come up with the perfect solution!

That's why weve started guilting redditors into buying stamps.

UPS: Just because your starving doesn't mean we don't deserve your money more.

Seems plain as the nose on my face that this is damaging our country and these republican assholes gotta go.

And by go I mean go to jail.
[comment]&gt; The Georgia senator laid out an apocalyptic view in the eyes of Republicans if Democrats take back the Senate, warning they would seek to make Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico states, try to abolish the Electoral College, add four justices to the Supreme Court and create a "single-party system." 

I love how he doesn't know the official Republican platform supports statehood for PR.  What is the problem with making DC a state other than partisanship?  


Abolishing the EC requires such a high bar it's not even on the cards even if Dems win the senate.
[comment]That's if shitbird Brian Kemp doesn't steel the election for Trump by cheating like he did in 2018.
[comment]Even though headlines like these give me hope I just worry that it will make Democrats complacent in November when is more important than ever that as many Democrats as possible vote this year.
[comment]Really, the stupidity is really strong in Georgia, look, opening up just three weeks after they closed, they're a recipe for disaster, with odds like that trumbo has to win there 😆
[comment]And if they lose Georgia once, they're not likely to get it back.  Once you unrig the voting machines, the GOP will struggle.
[comment]That explains why they want to open up the state so damned fast.
[comment]Damn right.
[comment]It warms my heart too but lets not be overconfident.   Don't underestimate the other side especially when they fight dirty.  Being the underdog inspires
[comment]All of those reforms are excellent ideas.... yeti he is partially right if they happened the Republicans would not win another election for years until they drastically reformed themselves....
[comment]If Biden pick up Abrams then the surely will lose GA
[comment]also, Republicans have owned Georgia since about 1997, and people are becoming disenchanted with the way they are running things....
[comment]Never underestimate republicans ability to suppress the vote.
[comment]Perdue is awful but if I were from Georgia, Loefflers appointment would really anger me. Most of the GOP voters in the state wanted Doug Collins, and none of the Dems wanted her. Plus she’s an extremely rich carpetbagger from Illinois, and her only connection to Georgia is via being a co-owner of a basketball team there.
[comment]Georgia won’t be won by Biden in 2020 but the demographic shifts and Biden’s African American turnout are promising and it could be much closer then normal.
[comment]Texas and Florida too.
[comment]Georgia, so hot right now. Ohio is so 2004.
[comment]If the state becomes a major hotspot after opening early, voters are gonna take their revenge at the ballot box.
[comment]Maine is going Blue. I know die hard republicans who won’t vote for Collins. She is horrible and toes the party line. Mainers want s senator who cares about Maine.
[comment]Republicans in Georgia added 4 justices to their state supreme court under governor Deal when they took control of the state. Such hypocrites.
[comment]Bout time!!
[comment]"The Democrats have made it that way."

Yeah sure blame us, you hiring a learning-disabled gameshow host had nothing to do with it.

[comment]Yeah me neither Bernie
[comment]The unappealing guy at the bar past last call still trying to get into the bartender's pants who won't take no for an answer.
[comment]&gt; The Sanders movement has remained genuinely indignant that it was unable to win the nomination and steer the party in a direction opposite of the desire of most of its voters by exploiting a divided opposition.
[comment]Bernie's entire strategy was to get a plurality by obtaining 30% of the vote in a fractured, segmented field.  That strategy collapsed when the field went from 12 candidates to two plus Tulsi Gabbard.

His team knew he would never get a majority.  He knew too.  He needs to quit and throw his support behind Biden.
[comment]Bernie and die-hard Bernie supporters need to accept that he isn’t going to be the nominee. But he and they did push the party left on many things and they should recognize that. I think they all need to check out Joe’s platform. Some of them they’ll balk at, but a lot of them I think they can throw their weight behind. He is a big supporter of unions and the PRO Act and supports universal healthcare if not a single payer system. His rural America platform is very sound and progressive as well and revives a lot of old new deal farm policies. For the rest of them, we just give them time. Most will wake up to the fact that four more years of Trump won’t lead to revolution, it will probably kill the progressive movement for another generation and further the new gilded age we live in.
[comment]You guys actually support Biden? So ready to be downvoted to hell. I can’t believe you morons exist. Thanks for ruining our chance at having a good candidate. I’m so done with this biased-toward-Biden  sub.

[comment]me too
[comment]This means that given a chance to simplify and speed up the process, 30% of voters still want to literally make voting more difficult and time-consuming for themselves.  I have no faith in people who make decisions like this.  They are not redeemable.
[comment]This is why trump wants to bankrupt the USPS
[comment]Like what voters want matters.
[comment]RIP USPS.
[comment]'Entirely' vote by mail?  I feel this number would be higher if the question was phrased differently. 

Like "would you support a vote-by-mail option?"

I feel like that last 30% aren't even all crazies, just people that might have any number of reasons not to lose in-person voting completely.
[comment]As an aside, surprisingly, [Texas allows mail in voting](https://my.lwv.org/texas/voting-elections/vote-mail), if you are:

* Sick or disabled

* Out of the county during early voting and election day. 

* In jail but otherwise eligible to vote

* **65 or older**

Republicans are afraid.
[comment]Whatever happens nationally, this is the first presidential election in which mail-in ballots will be accessible to all in the Obama-to-Trump swing state that is Pennsylvania. It gives me a little hope.
[comment]Daily reminder that 70% of people wanted witnesses to testify during the impeachment.
[comment]The only sensible thing to do is to consider all the facts. Here’s the opposing view. 

https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/heed-jimmy-carter-on-the-danger-of-mail-in-voting-11586557667
[comment]I know several people that had mail-in ballots thrown out by a republican AG because their signatures didn’t match. The only ballots thrown out in Missouri were in major metro areas, wonder why. I can see this being a major problem in GOP controlled states.
[comment]Funny how this idea wasn't pushed during the last few primaries. Now that it helps the Dem agenda they're game to vote by mail, but not at the peak of a pandemic outbreak.
[comment]Prior to the pandemic, I was not an advocate of this (Though I have always supported expanding access to voting in general.).  Now I am.  It's a public safety issue.

However, I do think we would be smart to include basic measures in the legislation and the system that's rolled out to ensure that people's votes are counted.  We don't want to see whole mail bundles of voters' ballots getting lost on the way to their homes or back to the election counting centers.  My concern is mainly that it'll happen to majority minority districts in the major cities and stuff, but we might be able to get some bipartisan support for protections if we pointed out that Republicans opposed stimulus funds for the post office and it is the post office who will be responsible for delivering people's votes (Quietly, in the cloak room.  No Democratic elected official should say that second part in public.).

So, specifically, these are the measures that occurred to me (It's possible that others can do better):

&amp;#x200B;

1. If a voter doesn't get a ballot within a certain time frame, he or she can request another via the Internet or via postal mail (Both options should be offered for the *request*.  I don't believe voting via Internet can be made secure enough considering the way a certain foreign power was able to hack things the last time that were less vulnerable.).  If the first lost incoming ballot gets delivered after the second is requested, that's fine- the voter should only face sanction if they mail both back.  If they get two, pick one and mail that one and only that one (Doesn't matter which one).  Enough time between the initial mailings and the election should be allowed for some voters to notice they did not get an initial ballot, request a ballot, and get it mailed out and sent back.
2. Each ballot would come with a unique "tracking number" on the inside, for use by the voter.  This would be similar to package deliver services.  Essentially, the voter would optionally be allowed to write down the tracking number and then use the Internet to get status updates like you can be packages.  Examples of status updates would be "ballot has been received by the election commission" and "Your vote has been counted".  If it takes more than a set period of time to get to the "Your vote has been counted" part, the voter would have the option of striking the first ballot and requesting a second- but in that case, only the second ballot would count.
3. Limited polling stations should remain open (with appropriate social distancing) for people who's ballots by mail all seem to be lost in transit, as a failsafe.
4. We may want to consider a sunset provision so that this applies to this year's elections and maybe the 2022 elections, but that it has to be reenacted to continue beyond that.  This could be a concession to Republicans to get them to go along with the bill and evidence that our main impetus here is public safety during the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

One issue that is probably going to arise is that it may be up to the states to determine  whether voting by mail is allowed.  If that happens, the blue states will allow it, the red states won't, and it'll depend who's in power and what the local political considerations are in the swing states.

If the federal government is not allowed to directly mandate that vote by mail be allowed, we could at least try to pass a suggested framework for doing it, along with funding to implement it that will be released to states that pass something within that framework (The framework may allow for some variance from state to state as long as the general concept and protections are adhered to) that we will release to them when and if they do so.

There is also a vague possibility we could tie other federal funding to the states to passing these types of voter laws.  For example, it used to be that the legal drinking age was up to the states, and many states set that age at 18 and not 21.  Highway funding from the federal government was tied to states increasing the drinking age to 21, and all 50 states have a uniform drinking age of 21 now.
[comment]I'll bet the percentage of people who support abolishing the Postal Service without a fight is single digits.

This 2019 poll showed 74% loved the Post Office, 18% thought it did a fair job, and only 8% giving it a poor rating.  That's a 92% approval rating.  It was the most popular agency listed, ahead of the Secret Service, CDC, CIA, and NASA.

&amp;#x200B;

[comment]Why didn't we do this before Bernie dropped out so we didn't have to send Wisconsin out into the pandemic?
[comment]It’s irrational to oppose this as a Republican too. Studies from the slow implementation of vote by mail in Washington showed a relatively small increase in total voter percentage (2-4%) in the places it was implemented in. Some of the marginal increases came from rural counties which had difficult time voting due to lack of access and some of the increases came from younger voters. Also, Republicans are so worried about voter ID over an irrational concern of illegal voting, in Oregon you register through the DMV so wouldn’t this help? Republicans are just being annoying and obstinate for no reason and endangering the public in the process.
[comment]Personally, I’d like voting by mail to be a more accessible option, but the ability to vote in person isn’t one I’d want to lose.
[comment]The number is eerily similar to trumbo disproval number of 70%, you don't win elections with numbers like that right 😂
[comment]Why can’t they make a govt website where you can put in your social security number and info  to register and vote online??
[comment]Yeah and a similar percentage want legal weed. 

I’m waiting still waiting for both issues to get fixed, like a teenager all dressed up waiting for my date to arrive.
[comment]Ignorant here.  So how would that work?  I get mailed a ballot to my address from the DMV?  How does anyone know I was the one that actually filled it out?  I've never voted absentee so I don't know how it works.
[comment]The Russians are licking their stamps as we speak.
[comment]It's probably just the 70% of voters who will vote for Biden, but somehow Trump will still win in the electoral college.
[comment]...and there will be virtually NO FRAUD either.
[comment]This is going to lessen for a while,then start getting bad again by election day. It's going to be a nightmare. I'm planning to look in to vote by mail. I demand to vote,but I also don't want the 'rona.

[comment]I now HATE republicans.  I knew they were bugs, but I had no idea how low they could go.
[comment]Rep Adam Schiff:

&gt; "The withholding of military assistance to get these investigations, which you now have acknowledged Ambassador Volker was wrong for the president to request. The idea of withholding that military aid to get these political investigations should be anathema, repugnant to every American because it means the sacrifice not just of Ukrainian national security but American national security for the interests of the president personally and politically. My Republican colleagues all they seem to be upset with this is not that the president sought an investigation of his political rival, not that he withheld a White House meeting and $400 million in aid we all passed in a bipartisan basis to pressure Ukraine to do those investigations. Their objection is he got caught. Their objection is that someone blew the whistle, and they would like this whistleblower identified, and the president wants this whistleblower punished. That’s their objection. Not that the president engaged in this conduct, but that he got caught. Their defense is, well he ended up releasing the aid. Yes, after he got caught. That doesn’t make this any less odious."

Murder.
[comment]I'm so heartened by how many people behind the scenes after so smart and ready to defend democracy
[comment]That speech also came right after a Devin Nunes pile of word-vomit that had me so pissed off. No wonder he had a little fire in him too when he gave this little closing speech. It was spot on and much needed after so much Republican lying and just...bullshitting.
[comment]My concern is that this is going to be Clinton Impeachment 2.0, with some acts which really cross the threshold of impeachable offenses.

&gt;The bad news for Republicans is that impeachment, whether they like it or not, is a fact-based process. On that score, they’re losing badly.

As long as they hold their line in the Senate, he might be Impeached, but the Republicans are going to be desperate to keep him in office. I'm concerned that this will only amplify and encourage abuse of power by the President and future President's by demonstrating that they are unaccountable for their actions.

Nunes and the other Republicans aren't taking this seriously. Every time Nunes opens his mouth he talks about how the TV ratings are bad. He doesn't give a care at all with respect to what is at risk and what this does to weaken the balance of power in our Government.
[comment]An American hero.
[comment]Schiff is a very bad liar.
[comment]I dont know how Schiff manages to keep a straight face when Nunes goes off on his word salad bullshit rants. I'd be tearing my hair out sitting directly next to him. Gotta give the man credits, his tolerance for bullshit is unmatched.
[comment]Did he really? You guys know that nothing will come of all this, right?
[comment]One thing that stood out to me was the stark the difference between the closing remarks of Devin Nunes and Adam Schiff. Nunes stumbled through his remarks, which were simplistic, accusatory, dumb and, frankly, dishonest. It got me to wondering if representatives can be charged with lying to Congress, because all of the Republicans have gone on the record with varying degrees of dishonesty during these hearings.
[comment]All of them are culpable and should be charged appropriately. If not, never forget and vote them out asap.

[comment]The question is, where will her voters actually go?  Do they go to Biden, or do they go to Warren because they want another female candidate?  I know Pete's base isn't going to be a clean break, either.  Not everyone is as influential over a given voter base as Jim Clyburn is.  I guess we'll just have to see if another John Kerry wins the primary.
[comment]Wow that’s really disappointing I was really excited about her running. But now maybe I’m glad she’s not running why is she supporting Biden that’s too bad if you want anything to change you’re sure not gonna get it with him.
[comment]Let’s get this loss on the road
[comment]Klobe!
[comment]Couldn't be more obvious that the screwjob against Bernie is in full force. Fuck him over again and watch Trump win...
[comment]As much as I want a woman to stay in this race and win, I’m not seeing it with Warren. Hopefully after Super Tuesday she will exit this race and get behind one of the other candidates. She doesn’t have a path to the presidency, not even close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Cuomo Slams Protesters: ‘Get a Job as an Essential Worker’: “The illness is death. What’s worse than that? This isn’t just about you... It’s about we,”
[selftext]https://www.thedailybeast.com/andrew-cuomo-tells-protesters-to-get-a-job-as-an-essential-worker[comment]I saw a commercial just yesterday. Domino's is practically begging for people to come work for them as delivery drivers, as they have so many orders for delivery. I'm sure other restaurants need it too. There are places hiring on the spot. 

These protesters don't want to go back to work. They want underpaid employees to go back to work for them. Pathetic. Cut your own goddamn hair and make your own fucking onion rings, you so-called "rugged individualists."
[comment]The Federal government has over 500 jobs in COVID-related fields listed today.

[https://www.usajobs.gov/coronavirus](https://www.usajobs.gov/coronavirus)
[comment]None of these are "spontaneous" they are all orchestrated by right wing groups, all with ties to trump and his re-election mega donors.
[comment]Cuomo is the leader we need right now!! Spell it it out for the stupid..just ugg, people need to step up right now &amp; not expect life to be fixed for them
[comment]Worse than death is permanent intubation, amputation, blindness, multiple organ failure, lots of covid19 "survival" outcomes that would make me choose euthanasia instead.
[comment]Headline from r/conservatives :  
&gt; N.Y. Governor's message to unemployed NY workers - "It's not all about you"
[comment]I mean when all non essential businesses are shut down that leaves a narrow field of options for jobs for other people. Does he really expect to funnel all those people working in clothing and furniture stores to work at grocery stores? There’s simply not enough jobs for all those people out of work. 

I understand people’s frustrations and be laid off (I was furloughed) but telling them to get a job as an essential worker is kind of tone deaf. Then again I’m not defending these racist stupid protestors by ANY means, I just relate to the frustration of being canned form my job.
[comment][this guy is making it seem like Cuomo is NOT talking about the protestors ](https://twitter.com/BenjaminPDixon/status/1253002916174139392?s=19)
[comment]Soo close to a Bernie quote lol
[comment]Cuomo for President please.
[comment]I feel like these protests, orchestrated by GOP insiders, are going to be a **huge** political blunder for them.

\&gt;80% of people want to stay indoors and follow the experts on social distancing to wait it out. Then they open the news and see a bunch of MAGAites with Confederate and Trump flags protesting this and endangering people. Way to turn public opinion against you.
[comment]So whats going to happen in a month when evictions start again?  After this is over some people will be put out and lose their houses. Its like people dont even want to try to get back to work. Yes the protest or half politically motivated and half motivated by people who are going broke, their mom and pop business about to go under. That measly $1200 is not enough. We cant live like this forever we have to start. Start out slow.
[comment]Cuomo needs to tell the people who he means by "we", and see if they agree.<|endoftext|>

[comment]His worst 30 days... so far!
[comment]Can't wait until his coloring book comes out!
[comment]No matter, he'll just keep charging on through, making the despicable decisions he's known for, all the while we hear crickets from the GOP...except a bible verse here and there from Rubio or a little hand wring from Mittens. Fuck you 40% of American that support DJT.
[comment]He is going to be fucking re-elected through the electoral college.
[comment]I just hope there's a camera on him when they ask the Secret Service to stand down, and WHOever puts the handcuffs on him. He will absolutely freak out like a spoiled little girl.
[comment]He’ll survive because even if the Dems find a spine and impeach, the republicans will not remove him from office.
[comment]And that's when the next thirty days said, "Hold my beer."
[comment]He’s sure in my thoughts and prayers!

Just kidding he can fuck off. 🤣😂🤣
[comment]How the literally eff is this a bigger deal than the numerous felonies outlined within the Mueller report? 

Answer: Because Trump and the GOP had spent two years conditioning their base to dismiss the results of the Mueller report. A fact that is an utter condemnation of our legal system today.
[comment]I keep hearing this type of stuff and than nothing happens
[comment]This is bullshit.  We have been seeing this for 1,000 days.  "He is melting down," "Its falling apart."  There have yet to be ANY consequences for Trump. None.  

What the fuck is Congress doing? Its time to fucking arrest all these assholes who are openly defying their subpoenas.  Put people in jail. DO SOMETHING to show us you are not going to allow Trump to continue his assault on the Constitution!
[comment]And if the Dems continue their in-fighting, Trump might get another 4 years of terrible weeks and months as President.  

Rally behind one candidate already and let's get *one* Democratic candidate to take Trump on.
[comment]A Gallup poll today announce that 52% of Americans want Trump impeached and out of office.
 
And this is just one week into the investigation, imagine how things will get when all the juicy stuff get released to the public.
 
We're at the point where the Republicans have to ask themselves how long can they justify to their constituents that they enabled Trump.
 
They want to get reelected in 2020, and you know in 2022 and 2024 a big question for re-election will be, how much did you enable Trump?

<|startoftext|>[title]The impeachment trial proved Republicans will hold onto power no matter what. I worked in US intelligence and I'm worried The only way Trump and his associates can prevent themselves from going to jail in 2021 is to remain in power, no matter the actual results of the election

[comment]Concur, the government is in jeopardy of takeover by authoritarians who don't give a whit about anything other than keeping in power. They don't even really agree on their ethos, other than to maximize their individual wealth and they don't really care where it comes from. Unless the population at large rises up against this, I think the Grand Experiment ends in failure.
[comment]Agreed.
[comment]This is what is going to happen. Out of office = in prison.
[comment]Makes me wonder why there aren't any things in place to prevent a tyrannical government from doing this.
[comment]Bill Maher has been saying this for years. He consistently asks people on his show how we will prevent it I have never seen a guest come up with a solution.
[comment]Why is he afraid of prison??  According to Trump he's never done thing wrong...so what is the problem??
[comment]“At any rate, liberals need to build strong network ties to law enforcement and the military, and get prepared for those inevitable claims about a “hoax” election. November 3, 2020 is an important date. We shouldn’t underestimate how wrong it could go if Trump’s renewed sense of emboldenment gets even more powerful.”
[comment]so if it is true that republicans will do anything to remain in power ...such as ignore the results of the election... then just how awful will be the things they do once they retain that power for another 4 years?!!!
[comment]Man fuck Trump
[comment]One bullet is all it takes
[comment]Hahahaha the fuck? Is there even a difference between this shit subreddit and the even shittier subreddit r/politics?

Dumb liberals. Trump is going to win because you’re party, once again, is out for Bernie to lose. Hell, they’re willing to support a mayor from Indiana! Oh, wait? but he’s gay! Yay diversity! 

Don’t get me started with cranky old pelosi. I’m starting to think she’s in cahoots with trump because by god her behavior is something else. Your party is in absolute disarray and I’m saddened to see such delusional optimism. Just as this whole impeachment trick. Thanks for wasting our tax dollars for nothing you stupid blue fucks. Only DUMB voters who don’t understand the political system took that news seriously. Good god, your whole party is an absolute embarrassment and representation of entitlement.

TELL me, ladies and gentlemen! How fruitful is the green new deal. And try to convince me that this type of madness of thinking ensuing in your party is an Ok thing. Because frankly, trump looks to be in an even better position to win than 2016. I’ll sure as hell vote for him.
[comment]I am sick of people saying "history will judge." History is written by the victors and I don't seen any indication the Republicans plan on giving up power. The media is complicit as they ignore the threat and promote the idea that this is just another election; vote your pocketbook.

Russia is at war with the United States. Vote your country.
[comment]Or they just won’t go to jail. Because. You know. It’s rich assholes in the government and Rich assholes In the government never go to jail.
[comment]Oh yeah he'd start a war for sure to keep his election going.
[comment]Yeah, dictator. We’ve been saying this for years.
[comment]But there was no crime or even something trump did or said that was wrong or bad. This was a with hunt from the Democrats to try and get trump out of office since they cannot beat him any other way. It's sad to see the democratic party stoop so low.
[comment]Same goes for the Democrats funny how politics work
[comment]NOPE. NOT GOING THIS ROUTE. Nope. This is not Sticking with me. I think WOMEN and Regular Democrats will vote him OUT. #VOTE
[comment]Won’t the military just march on the Capital??? It leans right but who wouldn’t want to be the hero who preserves the republic. Anyways, if America’s gonna becomes and Empire, I really hope it doesn’t form around House Trump and Trump Jr.
[comment]Will the Democrats go after them IF they can take 2020?    Has anyone expressed that they will/should?
[comment]*IF* Trump were to lose the election, he will claim its faked or foreign interference in which he will want an investigation and will ensure to not step down until after it is complete.

Get your butts ready for a wild election year.
[comment]Isn't it funny how people are back to the accusation that Trump is going to lose the election and will refuse to accept the results of the election? They were saying that for an entire year leading up to the 2016 election, and it ended up being the Democratic candidate that refuses to accept the results. How many times are people going to create a hypothetical situation in which Trump refuses to leave his position? 

It's just sad how many people still buy into this narrative, despite it not happening the multiple times they've made the accusation
[comment]Did anyone think anyone wouldnt  hold onto poqer no matter what?
[comment]I’m finding myself wondering if we’re headed for a military coup. And in which direction.
[comment]Trump would not be the first. Ceaser crossed the Rubicon with his army for this exact reason.
[comment]This is the exact reason why I don’t think the 2nd Amendment should be infringed upon. It’s entirely too possible for any government to become a tyranny.
[comment]we cant rely on the intelligence community nor should we expect a good portion of the military to help us either--mark my words trump will go down in infamy as ther face of 21st century avarice, greed, and evil

[selftext]https://www.newsweek.com/53-percent-republicans-prefer-trump-lincoln-1474864[comment]We can't remain a united nation with that level of stupidity.
[comment]To be fair, 53% of republicans think the wrong side won the civil war
[comment]it's safe to say that 53% of Republicans are flaming anti-American racists
[comment]Wtf?
[comment]Of course they do I mean Lincoln got rid of their slaves
[comment]Republicans are delusional.
[comment]Believe it or not, Lincoln is not that popular with racist whites in the south
[comment]Yeah that would be the 53% who think Lincoln did a bad job because they’re racist
[comment]and the other 47% think he's better than Jesus. The cult of Trump commands that level of stupidity.
[comment]Conservatives hate Lincoln.  This is no surprise.  T_D regularly shits on him for being a "tyrant" and "literally the worst president of all time."
[comment]Ironic that 53% of Republicans thinking Trump is a better president than Lincoln is the most compelling argument for States Rights I've ever seen, in that I want nothing to do with them and they can fuck off and fend for themselves.
[comment]Because it's a cult
[comment]Racism.
[comment]I caught about 10 minutes of Fox "News" at a relative's house over the holiday.

It was all about Trump's triumphant visit to Afghanistan, how much he loves and supports the troops, and how he's working a deal to bring our boys back home and make the locals fully responsible for their own country without any US support at all.

It'll happen any day now, we promise...

And still, they kept on harping about how badly Obama had messed up by having us go into Afghanistan, how he'd screwed over the troops by leaving them there for years, and how he was a complete failure at international politics.

So basically, the exact opposite of the truth.

This is the "manufactured reality" that a third of the country is being force-fed daily, over and over and over again until becomes their reality, and everything else is dismissed as "fake news."

Sigh.

Fortunately, they changed the channel to some random home renovation show, which is its own version of manufactured reality...
[comment]You remember how the GOP treated Lincoln, with  grapeshot to his skull.
[comment]But every dictator has a core of dimwits that follow them.  We saw Kanye's visit to the Oval Office, and he well represented the mental processes of most of Trump's voter base.  

He represented less well the billionaire base who regard Trump as their rather dumb guard dog, and Putin, who considers Trump's election as Russia winning WW 3.
[comment]Yes it’s a shitty cult almost as shitty as the sample size of this crappy poll....IJS
[comment]Of course they do - shocking part is that it’s only 53% and not 90%
[comment]Jesus Christ, how tf
[comment]A significant number if them are trolling. They're doing it to own the libs and sabotage the hated liberal media.

And then another significant portion are in the Cult of Trump and likely have hard feelings about the War of Northern Aggression.
[comment]Fucking how?
[comment]Given the current population of Republicans, I’m not at all surprised they aren’t enamored with Lincoln. After all, he fought to end slavery and they really want it back.
[comment]I hope the South really does rise again and this time we just let those dumb assholes leave.
[comment]Helps to note that even though Republicans have traditionally loved calling themselves "The Party of Lincoln", the policy stances and foundational tenets of the party system were pretty much a mirror image of what it is today. Lincoln and most Republicans of that era would be Democrats today. All of that "Party of Lincoln" b.s. is just trying to tie their horrible organization to a predominantly beloved president so they can say "see, we're just like that great man."
[comment]Probably more than 53%.  Source: am Republican and agree.
[comment]"Think" might be too strong a description as to what is going on in their heads, actually.
[comment]The traditional Republican of the 1960s was actually more educated and darker than today.  They were country club whites and an emerging black middle class and northern.  Eisenhower got in the low-40% of black votes.  Nixon got 37% of the black vote.  Then Goldwater started saying Lincoln wouldn't like his current party's stance on civil rights in 1964.  He slipped the party's standing with important coalitions

Then 1968 Nixon and the Southern Strategy and the Republicans have been playing the same song since: hate sells to the stupid and we can keep the rich in by bribing them with their own money.  African Americans?  They didn't need them with the former Southern Democrats becoming Republicans by the day.

Today, 2019, the Republican Party has pigeonholed itself as the party of the few billionaires and the uneducated poor whites they can scare into believing minorities and immigrants are coming to take the jobs the billionaires already plan to take to China.

Vote against any and all Republicans you can in 2020.  They can't be trusted as dogcatcher and definitely not trusted to govern responsibly.
[comment]This is your brain off facts
[comment]I love the “See, Republicans aren’t racist, Lincoln was Republican and he freed the slaves!” argument.

Even though we know the parties pretty much traded places since then.
[comment]Does that also mean that 53% of Republicans miss slavery?
[comment]Well of course, Republicans aren’t massive fans of the whole emancipation thing
[comment]53% of Republicans are too stupid to exist.
[comment]My father is one of them. :(
[comment]To be fair, Lincoln wouldn't have a place in what the GOP has turned into under Trump. Hell, I don't even think Reagan would fit in now.

[comment]How is this a suprise? The way they go on about immigration and anyone not in their group, I'd think they'd put Lincoln's courage and tolerance at the very bottom of the list. Now Andrew Jackson may pull closer to the top.

1. Fired the pandemic task force to prevent situations as these to happen, and if they happen to have a plan ready to act from day 1
2. Actively prevented scaling up testing so the numbers would stay low on purpose for political gain
3. Publicly denied the crisis and misinformed the American public
4. Privately knew this was a calamity partially of their own making and profited of the misinformation and advanced knowledge of it

Get involved in the campaign. Get involved in a 3rd party organization that supports the Democratic ticket (Mom’s Demand, Sierra Club, NARAL, NOW, etc).

Join a Postcards to Voters group and plan to start writing and not just once.

Make calls or send texts for the Biden campaign.

Get involved with an Indivisible group or local Democratic Party at the state and county level.

I have seen what trump’s campaign is doing and they are VERY organized. We can’t underestimate them.

Support Amy McGrath’s campaign and let’s not forget we NEED to win the Senate as well.

But the only way this happens is if all Democrats come together along with Republicans and independents joining us in defeating this narcissistic demonic entity, wannabe dictator and his cult of followers. For the health, safety, well being and even the lives of the American people this has to be done Donald j drumpf has enough American blood on his hands for the way he and his administration have handled this catastrophe / pandemic and he/they need to be defeated in November otherwise there may cease to be an America we all recognize.
[comment]Democrats need people online, I hope the younger generation (not that I'm old lol) really get involved they are the ones that can push us to the winner's circle/white House we need a strong online presence to overtake the Republicans and the Russian hacks/bots. we as Democrats have to be like Republicans and not give a fuck about rules, Republicans fight dirty they put out dirty ads they freaking lie all the time about everything they use every trick in the book and we as Democrats need to be the same way and even bigger and better at doing it there are no fucking rules for 2020. We need a big presence on Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and every other online social networking site.
[comment]I'm no political strategy expert, but "sacrifice grandma to the economy" might not have been the best message to shore up his support with seniors.
[comment]Its easy for people to say they don't like Trump and wont vote for him.... Until you put him next to Biden. Same thing happened with Hillary. This is going to be about who is hated more and ends up losing, not who wins.

[selftext]https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Nancy-Pelosi-Trump-morbidly-obese-malaria-drug-CNN-15279305.php[comment]This is the kind of stuff that gets me through
[comment]And suddenly my it’s like a breath of life has entered my tattered body.
[comment]She's way off. As a fake physician, I truly believe that the doses is way too low. 

Doubling or tripling the dose should prevent all cases of covid-19, the flu, syphilis, and aids. This will make trump bigger safely.
[comment]Time for the media to lambast Democrats (and only Democrats) for not being civil.
[comment]Shhhhhhh. Nobody tell him.
[comment]If I understand correctly, Trump's likely BMI is a little above 30, which would make him obese but not morbidly obese.

[selftext]https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/bloomberg-trump-fake-hair-obese-spray-on-tan-little-946685/[comment]I'm liking Bloomberg more every day.
[comment]The more Mike draws fire away from Bernie, the better the odds. Even if he knows he can’t win, he should keep pushing forward and taking digs at Oompa Loopma mushroom dick.
[comment]No one has tinier fingers or a smaller mushroom dick than Trump though.
[comment]Who do you think fairs better in a national election vs. Trump, Bernie or Bloomberg?

Bernie is too left for me, I’m really starting to really like Bloomberg the more I read about him and his platforms. 

At this point, fwiw I don’t think either is beating Trump
[comment]This is the only way to fight Trump.  I’m sick of hearing people call him out for “falsehoods”.  The man’s a fucking liar and he’s lying.
[comment]I’m really trying to convince myself that Mike is 100% playing a smoke and mirrors game, with the sole purpose of trolling the shit out of Trump until election day. I am trying to believe that he is throwing his proverbial hat in the ring just to be bulletproof glass between the Dems and Trump’s slushy-ass bullshit. Mike has (legitimate) beaucoup $$$, which we all know is fucking catnip to Trump, precisely bc he feels more threatened by Mike’s money than anything else. At the end of the day Trump knows he’s a fraud and a hack, and will sacrifice his last molecule of “non-renewable body battery” to attack his enemies — perceived *and* real. 

The realist in me knows that Mike’s intentions are anything but selfless &amp; altruistic...but if it means getting to watch Trump lose his shit day after day after day until November – well, then, God bless.
[comment]Wasn't there some government photos taken of 45 where he had them photoshop longer fingers, slimmer waist, etc. I'd never before ever heard of photos of US officals being retouched for publication.  Maybe team Mike can get the pre and post images with commentary by the artists. 

Oh, and now that Republicans have legalized all forms of bribery, maybe someone can leak medical and personal and business tax records. Really only applies to folks that keep that stuff away from the voters.
[comment]Trump doesn't like Bloomberg because he is everything Trump isn't like...a billionaire and self made.
[comment]Yes! Hes our junkyard dog.  BITE BLOOMBERG BITE!

No you can't be president but keep doing this and you'll get my respect
[comment]It feels childish to stoop to Trump’s level by retaliating against the personal barbs he spews, but Trump got elected in the first place. So, maybe some people really do respond to and vote based on who’s winning a playground rock fight.
[comment]Subscribe me to this shit immediately. 

Sextuple bankrupt reality-show narcissist, beauty pageant pervert, Twitter-obsessed snowflake.
[comment]Manlet seething after being called short lmao.
[comment]Lol nobody gives a fuck about bloomberg, y'all dems are so desperate to shoot yourselves in the foot again its pathetic. Pay attention to your base and not your corporate masters and y'all might win this time. Screw around on bernie again and watch your party lose power forever, he's only way out in front.
[comment]TBF Bloomberg is super tiny. Way too petite to get elected.
[comment]Well, let’s see what happens when we punch back after they go low.
[comment]The tribe may control the world, but one of theirs will never be an American president.
[comment]Never thought I'd say this but God bless Michael Bloomberg!
[comment]I just want Bloomberg to host SNL now
[comment]Ah yes. Reacting to childish language with even worse childish language. This is better than the superbowl.
[comment]I'm so conflicted. On the one hand, I'm glad to see someone just attacking him...since policy debates against an overgrown man-child seem to have little impact on voters. On the other hand, I'm deeply saddened if this is the new (low) normal for political debate.
[comment]This is awesome! Now I know that sounds tacky, and it is, but I’m weary of three years of Trump name calling and getting little, if any, pushback in return. It’s not the way Democrats do things but Trump has turned politics into a different form than in the past. 

I guess the question is do we adapt and respond in kind or adapt in a different way?
[comment]Your party is more worried about Trump being orange and gender pronouns than winning elections.

[comment]Careful people. Stepping into Abe’s shoes, needs very big feet and balls. 
He liked to wrestle professional wrestlers in person.
I bet he would burst into a loud booming laughter seeing Trump hiding behind his phone “Twittering” and “Tweeting” his petty grievances
about people not being nice enough to little Trumpy.
[comment]Everyone's overlooking one big fat elephant in the room when comparing either one of these men to Lincoln and that's racial segregation, or rather their support of the states right to choose it.  

Joe Biden gave the eulogy for Strom Thrurmond.  

Just STOP, please.  Or at least dont compare him to Lincoln...    
We need him because white nationalists control our future.  Period.  Stop pruning his image to fit our dark reality as we bow down and fall in line for "the better and only allowed choice" once again
[comment]Who *isn’t* Abraham Lincoln when compared to Donald Trump? Hitler? Ted Bundy? Stalin? The list is *not* long...
[comment]What is he if he's not compared to Donald Trump?
[comment]While I guess I will be voting for Biden in the election (and then feeling sick to my stomach immediately) this headline made me roll my eyes so hard.
[comment]There’s a lot of people who have always had Biden as their first choice...
[comment]Jesus, he's easily the WORST candidate the Democrats have run since John Kerry and he's going to make a terrible President. He's not going to do 1 Progressive thing while in office, if he somehow manages to win in November (which is a big fucking if).
[comment]yeah the fuck right. at absolute best he's a straw man for 4 more years of Mr T. never be deceived that the rich will allow you to vote away their wealth. it's all farcical. we're so used to the term 'lesser of two evils' that we lose sight of the fact that THEY'RE BOTH EVIL
[comment]Vote Blue. The planet can only take so much damage from our species. I will vote for whatever candidate that has the green platform, I’d vote for Elmer Fudd over Trump if candidate Fudd believes in climate change and slithers over the lowest possible bar of not rolling back existing energy regulations.

I once told my Trump supporter mother-in-law I would not only vote for Trump again, but in person help carve his face on Mt. Rushmore if he became the greatest eco-warrior president we’ve ever had, even if everything else stayed the same.

I’m normally not a single issue voter, but in 2016 I started working for a company that operates on the cross section of life sciences and environmental sciences, and my eyes have been seriously opened up to the trouble our planet is in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Top U.S. Marine orders all Confederate symbols be removed from Corps bases
[selftext]https://www.newsweek.com/confederate-flag-marine-bases-general-berger-1489485[comment]There’s no place for relics like this is our armed services.
[comment]They were an enemy of the United States. Republicans seem to forget that.
[comment]Good job jarheads!!!!
[comment]The heritage argument is absolute garbage. I've heard people say, "Heritage not Hate." But the truth is it's a heritage OF hate. You can't justify wanting to own and abuse another human being without hate in your heart or at least some sense of superiority that stems from disdain.

Some want to say the Civil War wasn't about slavery, that it was an economic war. That's also a stupid argument because, OF COURSE, it was about economics! It was about free labor and profiting off of it. The Emancipation Proclamation wasn't just in the interest of human rights, it was about trying to cripple the Confederate economy by reducing and eliminating free labor.

Look, there's a place for history. It's called a museum. I think all Confederate relics should be housed in museums because it's important never to forget. But they should all be removed from public spaces because that makes it appear as a celebration.

I think the naming of some places using Confederate figures like generals should be reviewed and changed. This isn't about erasing history. It's about preserving it the right way so that we can be educated about it without celebrating it.
[comment]They should kick out anyone they see posting them. There is no place in the military for separatist or fascist ideology. If we can keep people out for bone spurs, then we can keep people out for dangerous ideology. It's arguably more important.
[comment]Makes utter sense.  The union defeated the confederation. It should be looked upon as at least socially treasonous imo. 🤷‍♀️
[comment]Americans aren't comprehending what's going on. Young racists who want to join the militias are encouraged to get basic training in the military and then they are more useful. And they can even proudly proclaim themselves veterans even though they lied when they swore the oath to protect the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.

God help us if these people ever get control of the Air Force. Oh wait...
[comment]Wait what? How were these flags even allowed to fly on US military bases? They were an enemy flag?
[comment]I have two great sources for people who say the Civil War was about anything other than slavery.

1. Here are reasons for seceding in their own words [https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states)
2. Here is the famous "Cornerstone Address" given by the Vice President of the Confederacy [https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/)

Although I teach American Literature and not American History, I have my students read these primary documents to smack them with some reality.

When we read "On Civil Disobedience" we talk about acts of civil disobedience and protest through history. I ask them to compare people taking a knee to the protesters at the Unite the Right rally. Invariably, I have students who look at Colin Kaepernick and call him a piece of garbage, say things like, "If he doesn't like it here he should leave", "He should just be happy that he can live here". Then those same people look at Neo-Nazis parading around with the Confederate flag and Nazi flags and will say things like, "Well, they have freedom of speech."
[comment]These bumpkins have always existed but they kept their stupid shit in the barracks where it belongs if you need a binky.
[comment]This wasn’t ALREADY a rule????
[comment]Prediction: 45 will override this soon.
[comment]The only place this belongs is in a museum where it can serve as a warning from the past.
[comment]Yall like to pretend this country isnt still as racist as it actually is. We know the truth though.
[comment]Only until the election and then its back to marines doing hoo yah and high fives for trump and the racists at the gop
[comment]How was this not already the policy???? Good lord.
[comment]I really hate how these hick fucks use the "battle" flag as their "Confederate flag". They should use the real one that is 75% plain white to show how they really feel about people of color, just like the flag intended to be. There's your heritage you ignorant fool.
[comment]*brushes hands off*
Racism has finally been defeated today. We can all go home now.
[comment]The real news is what took them so long?
[comment]When the General says so, it happens. No debate.
[comment]It's not the flag/country they've pledged an oath to uphold.

Matter of fact, the ":stars and bars" lost.
[comment]It's the equivalent of someone flying an ISIS flag; it's the flag of an enemy that sought to destroy this country. An enemy that was defeated.
[comment]The thing I love is that flag isn't *the* confederate flag.  It only appeared in the \~50s and was a response to the civil rights moment.  If you really cared about your history you would fly your family's flag!
[comment]Good for the Marines and hopefully if it's not already will be removed from all other military bases and then maybe somebody can tell that fucking orange orangutan we have in office in Washington to quit kissing the asses of white trash supremacist and nationalist and thinking these people are fucking heroes or whatever else he praises them for they're nothing but trash!! But then again 40% like this guy because when in a cult you have to agree and do as the dear leader says or you will be out of the cult.
[comment]Is anyone brave enough to see how r/conservative is handling this?
[comment]Worth noting, it isn't the flag of the Confederacy. It is a BATTLE flag. The fight is over. They LOST. Who builds memorials to LOSERS.
[comment]I might have an unpopular opinion in this case, but generally my problem is much less with the flag and more so has always been with the people I see flying it. They're usually just trashy looking people and I know for a fact a lot of these people wouldn't be flying the confederate flag if it hadn't become a controversial thing in the mainstream after the Charles church shootings.

To be fair though, the commonly used confederate flag isn't the main confederate flag. What we commonly see  (and correct me if I'm wrong) is the confederate battle flag, which from what I've gathered represented the troops in battle whilst the 'actual' confederate flag was more representative of the confederacy and slavery. Granted, I get the feeling the people flying that flag don't even realize that.
[comment]Its surprising to hear they were even allowed in the first place. Flying the flag of a defeated enemy army on your military base? Odd
[comment]cool but can we please keep them in storage or in a factory, i feel like it would benefit our kids better if we have our history preserved than destroyed<|endoftext|>

Trump voters and non voters tend to be selfish and emotion based. They aren't going to drop Trump/vote Biden based on comprehensive arguments that it'll be in the best interests of all.


But if they're worried about their lives and their jobs they might be won over.
[comment]Democrats need to keep it up with ads like that, just telling the truth. Keep the narcissist in the white house having tantrums and looking like a pouty hypocrite child.
[comment]His buttons are so easy to push.  And he has so many of them.
[comment]Great ad. Simple but effective
[comment]The video link in the piece says no longer available. Why would it be down?
[comment]Easily the biggest snowflake
[comment]Attack, attack, attack. Never let up. Never show mercy.
[comment]You can already see that are trying to frame his campaign as not only against Biden, but, in an effort to energize his base, against Obama as well.
[comment]Trump makes is too easy.  Instead of hiding his dismay, he openly starts flailing.  Not only does he give his opponents more ammo, he lets them know that they hit a soft spot.
[comment]Because he knows he's responsible for it by blowing it off.  Other countries that started to have new infections around the same time we did are now on their way to recovery.
[comment]After talking to my Trump-supporting family I can confidently tell you that they do not care. I was told they “separate the personality from the politics,” which leads me to believe that he could, indeed, shoot someone in 5th Avenue and it wouldn’t change their opinion. “We hate him, but we’re going to vote for him because the Democrats hate America and their corruption will make us all poor communists.” No matter what happens, we HAVE to keep the House and take the Senate. Republicans will NEVER hold him accountable for literally anything. Literally their bar is so low now that as long as he doesn’t call himself a Democrat, they will keep voting for him.
[comment]He said he was playing golf to exercise 😂
[comment]Good.
[comment]If Biden can rebound from his own "youre not black" comment he could focus on just being relentless on Trumples.
[comment]His supporters at this point are a lost cause like the Nazis who fled to Argentina.

We have to concentrate on getting people pissed off enough to vote! Get them to realize this is about our lives and getting rid of a so called president!
[comment]1. Run. Up. The. Score.
2. I genuinely think this line of ads will work. The majority of people have been unhappy with him. Keep hitting these points. Studies show that while ads don't influence turnout, they work at shifting votes in favor of the candidate. We need a daisy or crying Indian ad.
[comment]Dont call him a bully.  Republican voters love a bully.  Call him Weak, Unintelligent and above all a failure.

Poke holes into the delusion of adequacy he is trying to spread.
[comment]He can dish it out, but he can’t take it.
[comment]The people defending this sound so ridiculous. "He took a day off." "He deserves a vacation day after all his hard work." What in the actual fuck? A day off from drinking Diet Cokes, watching Fox News, and tweeting lies all day?
[comment]Karma is a bitch tRump 😆
[comment]Imagine how fucked we'd be if he were a monarch with actual direct control over the nation.

[comment]Funny thing is that this is being spun as a negative ad.... no, it’s pretty much just a form of reporting. “100,000 Americans have died due to an ongoing pandemic, time for a round of golf.” The sun is a star, oceans are bodies of saltwater, and Trump is devoid of sympathy or understanding when it comes to a pandemic he had the ability to curtail at the very least, or to avoid at best something I as a layman knew was problematic at the end of January. The bastard was informed (by public accounts) in January at a minimum, yet I am sure the intelligence community was well aware of a “mystery virus” well before the public was informed. If I can offer better advice for the general public versus the president, that is a problem. I should not have more authority when it comes to advising my older (the group most likely to die) parents, nor should I be the one advising his immunocompromised sister. I’m not a health official. I am not trained medically beyond CPR, I should not have a better grasp of anything than the president. READ YOUR DAILY INTEL BREIFS LIKE A BIG BOY, YOU FUCKING DUNCE. Literally tens of thousands of lives could have been saved if Trumpy Bear had  listened for five fucking minutes worth of strategic planning in February or March. Who caught/killed Osama Bin Laden? Obama. Who is negotiating with terrorists to this day in Afghanistan? The Trump administration is negotiating with terrorists in (correct me if wrong) Qatar, 2,000 to be released in the coming days. This “deal” was made without Afghan government involvement. Not only is this stupid beyond belief, it will send women back to the Stone Age. Who negotiates with the Taliban, who killed people for listening to music? To quote Stan from American Dad: “Wow, it’s like the footloose town times a million.”

[comment]Wow! Joe Biden (presidential) is out on the streets talking to AMERICANS while tweety trump is hiding in little bunker. Need new leadership &amp; FAST!
[comment]Let's figure out a way to mobilize people to the polls in November. I'm thinking of volunteering in minority neighborhoods in swing states, Like OFA did in 2012. Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Cleveland, etc. DM me is an organization already exists or we can make one.

[comment]He still has my vote, but I don’t think Joe Biden would do it without the cameras around.

[comment]Well played, Joe. Well played. Let this ride for a bit and try to avoid microphones for a while
[comment]Joe Biden talks with and shakes hands with supporters while the demonic stays hidden in the deep dark dungeon. Donald j drumpf just did a photo op in front of a church, for those of you who did not see it he had national guard and police open up a walkway for him so he could walk his bitch ass up in front of the church in DC to look at a Bible. His demonic ass was showing it off to the camera like he does his stupid executive signings looking at it like he's never seen or held such a thing in his life of which is mostly true.

[comment]Since there’s no legal basis for an “impeachment inquiry” in which the executive branch can’t cross-examine witnesses I would say such a letter would be just fine.
[comment]Wtf does Trump have on him?
[comment]Makes you wonder what Trump used to blackmail Graham that one time they golfed together.
[comment]Taking his duty seriously by blindly supporting a man no matter what crime he commits.
[comment]If whatever Trump has on him isn't a) illegal and b) is something between him and another consensual adult, no one cares and he needs to stop protecting this treasonous ass hole
[comment]What *does* Trump have on him?
[comment]Ahhh Little pink house’s!!!
[comment]If a Democrat gets elected president and pulls the whole, " forgive and forget" instead of prosecuting all the crimes of this Administration, we are truly done for and there is no reason to ever elect any Democrats ever again. If neither party will stand for justice, we might as well step aside and let everything be destroyed in hopes that From the Ashes something decent might rise again.
[comment]That stupid closeted fag cannot simply be worried about being outed. There's got to be more than that.
[comment]Trump must have threatened to release the boy fucker tapes. Ms. Lindsay loves her some young boys.

<|startoftext|>[title]Pelosi announces House moving forward with articles of impeachment against Trump
[selftext]https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-make-statement-impeachment-n1096341[comment]Good. About time.
[comment]&gt; Trump said Senate Republicans will call Pelosi, Schiff, the Bidens "and many more" to testify.

Of course that’s how you adjudicate if trump abused his office to pressure a foreign government for help with the election.
[comment]I'm not the biggest fan of Pelosi (although I'll choose her any day over Trump) but I have to give her credit where credit is due.  Trump always liked to portray himself as this sharp shrewd strategist (or "stable genius"), but it is really Pelosi who has been shrewd and strategic.

Her intentional slow-walking and resistance to rush any of this is beginning to pay dividends while Trump and his team scramble to rearrange the deckchairs on the Titanic.
[comment]Merry Christmas!
[comment]Fast tracking this over a holiday is probably a bad decision.
[comment]Feels like a campaign move for the Democratic Party.
[comment]Finally.
[comment]This is stupid strategy on the part of the  Democrats. They’re going to get these articles of impeachment through right before Christmas, when the average American doesn’t give a damn about politics. The Republicans in the Senate will say “we’ll take up the trial after the break.” Then, after New Years, the “trial” in the senate will start. Republicans will call all their witnesses and propagandists to repudiate all the evidence that the public has already forgotten about from these most recent hearings. The Senate was NEVER going to vote to impeach anyway, so it’s just free advertisement to bash the Democrats. 


In addition, there currently 5 Democratic Senators seeking the nomination for president. They’ll be off the campaign trail for however long the Republicans can drag this thing out. In summary, no, Pelosi is not a shrewd politician. This whole inquiry has been badly bungled from the beginning by Pelosi and the Democratic leadership. It should have been over a year ago.
[comment]Honest question, do any of you truly believe Trump will be impeached?
[comment]The House (D) can put forward whatever they like. The Senate (R) will not be impeaching their guy.
[comment]I think Trump is going to fire her.
[comment]Did she say why they’re impeaching him?
[comment]I
[comment]The impeachment process is a win for the president. The entire process has to be put through THE SENATE that is run by the Republicans. Pretend we're playing basketball. I dribble the ball up the floor, I cross you over, and I have an open lane to the net, but instead of shooting the open shot, I pass the ball to the other team and expect them to score on their own basket for my team to win. The GOP is not going to score on their own net and trump will never be impeached. (Unfortunately)
[comment]If the dems has not taken up this impeachment, it would set the precedent that its ok for the president to extort another government for personal reasons.  He made the call this the day after the Mueller report came out.  

Further, yes the republicans control the senate and the trial, but Justice Roberts will preside.  Literally fast tracking decisions such as if Bolton, Mulvaney, Giuliani, et al. can refuse subpoenas.  And if they testify, they are under oath and will have to decide if they want to protect Trump or save themselves.  

Justice Roberts can also require documents to be turned over that are currently being withheld.

He still probably won’t be voted out, but is lot of info could come to light.

And I would love for Schiff to testify.  That guy is very smart.  I think he’d run circles around those idiot republicans spewing their conspiracy theories.
[comment]Its about god damn time.

[comment]Why are they trickling it out like our Republic is some kind of scripted television show that needs constant suspense and drama to drive the plot?!
[comment]By the end of this I would not be surprised is Trump is found to be in tape explicitly asking for the investigation and specifically calling it “quid pro quo“
[comment]Bolton is a real asshole.  He should have volunteered to testify under oath instead of selling books.

He also could do a sworn affidavit.
[comment]President Cunty is guilty as fuck.
[comment]How is this president not out of office for just lying. That's it.

That's all he has to do to not deserve it in my opinion.
[comment]Guiliani has said he has an insurance policy. 

I want Guiliani to cash it in. Do what's right for the country and not his personal bottom line.
[comment]Does Parnas had the pee tapes as well?!
[comment]This article does not mention Parnas once.  Why is his name in your title?
[comment]i think somebody took his stapler
[comment]This month is a roller coaster of emotions.
[comment]Bolton can't publish if Trump censors him. He can't claim executive privilege and then sell that info to the public.

[comment]Well heck, relapse the video and audio.
[comment]Democrats cheering on Bolton.  This entire world is upside down.
[comment]I have never liked John Bolton to me he's always been a right-wing crazy hack, but when someone with John Bolton's stature comes out and says he's got something against this wannabe dictator then everybody who's anybody should listen, because John Bolton has been around for 40 years and he is a real day conservative with a capital C and a war monger. John Bolton would never come out against this wannabe dictator if he did not know/think what he did with Ukraine was against the law or against our country's best interest.
[comment]Lev Remembers
[comment]Why is Bolton always holding his eyeglasses? There has to be a reason. The better to see the war on the horizon?
[comment]Omfg this whole mess.
[comment]It is like a brush fire, springing up all over. The GOP should smarten up and impeach him. Kill Trumps death grip over the party, and lie to him if he tries to screw with the party the intelligence agencies will be ordered to look over every aspect of his life as a citizen before and after to shut him up...
[comment]Stop saying you have more video and audio. Release the damn things! I say a data dump on all the senators doorsteps is the only way.

[comment]Biden is the worst.  He shouldn’t be president just because Obama wanted to win Pennsylvania
[comment]Donated again to Joe last night 💎🐊🍦
[comment]Joe knows common sense
[comment]I'm sure most of you know this already but to the ones that say or don't think Joe Biden can bring out the vote or energize the vote, what you need to do is check out who has the most votes throughout the contest so far, which is called the popular vote and that person is President Joe Biden and that's not a Freudian slip, do to Joe Biden winning I believe every county in South Carolina he is only behind 4-6 delegates at this time. So if whoever you are voting for does not win we all need to back the Democratic nominee no matter who it is, Because we have to get the orange orangutan looking, nut bag out of Washington.
[comment]Trump would eat this man alive on a debate stage.
[comment]Yeah, you are right. President Trump is responsible for the Corona Virus. He made it in his White House kitchen just so he could screw the Chinese. He has done such a poor job protecting America that people are dropping like flies in the States.  The Dems, like yourself, are simply soooo desperate to find one last thing to blame Trump for, the corona virus is the obvious choice. Vote for Bernie, please.

[comment]Good
[comment]JFC, I would hope so.
[comment]Let's face it, even Trump will vote for Biden. Calamity Trump knows his presidency is cursed and the one thing he loves about it, his Trump rallies, can't even happen now without killing all his fans.
[comment]Holy shit. I thought she was in the Trump camp. This is huge!
[comment]Just like when Bernie or Warren did it, this is not news. They have all said they would do this for years now.
[comment]No shit.  How is this even newsworthy??  What we need to see is articles about every fucking GOP politician everywhere voting for Trump
[comment]People saying this isn't newsworthy - a lot of people who were very invested in Bernie and reluctant to vote for Biden are going to be looking to Bernie's surrogates - such as AOC - to see what they decide to do. If we're going to win we're going to need everyone in our corner and unsure Bernie voters are not an insignificant cohort by any means.
[comment]Her opinion matters. Backing Biden is big. Blue wave people.
[comment]Me too
[comment]Why? And don’t mention trump in your answer.
[comment]Why is this news? She’s a Democrat.
[comment]We all will. But I for one don’t plan to stop pushing him to the left. 

He and Obama got elected promising change. It’s time the Democrats delivered.
[comment]Won't everyone?
[comment]Smart move. I really don't understand Bernie or busters. Bernie is a great choice but Biden can still change things for the better
[comment]NO SHIT?!
[comment]OMG! First Obama, than Gore, now AOC? This is madness. Why are all these democrats endorsing the democratic candidate?
[comment]Like, we didn't know that she was going to vote for Biden?
[comment]Do we have another option?
[comment]Well yeah, she’s not an idiot.

[comment]Very true statement. I was wondering about his bold and insane actions (in a first term) even before this crisis. Most presidents play it much safer in a first term. But, because of his cult following, he can really get away with anything. Maybe we will get lucky and he will go left in the second term. Nah, let’s just vote him out.

[comment].. while 41% think it’s done a good job.. huh? A .. a   “good job?”  Oh dear
[comment]This doesn't tell us why though. Some may think its overblown, others may think its "under blown." My guess is if the economic damage exceeds the death toll significantly, a lot of people will start to think it was all much ado about nothing. People won't get that if it didn't happen, more would have died. They'll just say "hey under 100k died but I lost 25% in my 401k, boo democrats and lamestream media"
[comment]"Now"...
[comment]Ohh we all know who the 40% is no doubt
[comment]Now? As in it just happened? Damn Repubtards
[comment]How is it possible for one person to approve of this disaster?
[comment]The Trump administration is trying to say this is like Pearl Harbor. Actually, it's like the Bataan Death March with our health care workers on it. Resident Trump cannot escape the consequences of his actions. The daily drip of a death count will doom Do Nothing Donnie.

Ask Jimmy Carter.
[comment]Private poll most Americans are complete idiots or can't be bothered to pay attention even in a world crisis.
[comment]History will be the ultimate judge, and I'm betting it's not going to be nice about it.  So much could've been done sooner to slow this thing down.  Closing the country off from foreign travelers faster, telling everyone to wear masks 6 weeks ago, and telling governors to lock down sooner, mandatory quarantines for all those people coming into the US, especially on the cruises.  This thing is spread through people's breath, so if we ALL cover up this will help prevent it from spreading.  If one infected person is on a train or bus and coughs or even breaths heavily they're putting that crap in the air and on every surface near them.  Anyone else comes in an touches then wipes face or mouth they now have it ... that's why I think it's going so crazy in NYC and other places with public transportation.  A bus driver in NYC videoed someone coughing on his bus, and the driver died weeks later after having it.  The thing is you can find science reports from months ago covering all this ... this administration fired most of the scientists in the cabinet and put his friends and financial backers into the positions.  They're not listening to the science.  How many times has Dr Fauci contradicted Trump, even to the point where Trump cuts him off.  It's sad how anyone can think Washington has played this thing well. 

The only way out of this is to tell everyone nation wide, wear masks or face coverings or you will be fined.  And if you are infected you must be quarantined, and I'd love to see large sites for people who would like to be quarantined away from home as to not infect family.  And every vehicle used by public transportation needs to be cleaned very often.  

This is a mess...
[comment]Is majority 50.9%
Or
75%?

It makes a difference
[comment]Fuck all these polls. The only thing they ever show me is that a large portion of us are complete morons.
[comment]To the poster mnd you're absolutely right his base doesn't believe in vaccines and that's because they don't believe in science,that's why  having his right-hand douchebag in charge of things by the name of Mike pence is the worst choice anybody could have made, but why should things change just because people are dying, this POS Donald j drumpf hardly ever makes the right choices or correct decisions no matter what it is or what it pertains to.

phones. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Among the entire sample, **35% described themselves
as Democrats**, **25% described themselves as Republicans**, and 41% described themselves as independents or
members of another party.

&gt; The landline total respondents were 350
and there were 652 cell phone respondents.
[comment]Too bad the majority of Americans aren't represented by any office.  What matters in the US:  
1.  Majority of Congressional districts  
2.  Majority of States  
3.  Majority of the EC  
4.  Majority of the SCOUS

[comment]I guess I was naive but I held out hope that some Republicans were courageous enough to go against Trump... to go against authoritarianism but it doesn't seem that way.  I finally realized the Republicans are all "Trump" now.  He is their Dear Leader.
[comment]Every step the Republicans have done little more than attempt to demonize the accusers,

and complain about the LEGAL format of the inquiry, and try to drag out the procedure.

They had no valid defense, Trump readily ADMITTED to the act of trying to get 'dirt' on his political rival Joe Biden and the Biden family in exchange for funds which were already promised to Ukraine.  He held them up, and despite claims from the GOP, Ukraine has still NOT received all of that funding.

So Trump IS GUILTY of abuse of power.

Trump has ALSO repeatedly stopped members of his cabinet from testifying, while publicly declaring that they would exonerate him!

Telling his people to literally IGNORE congressional subpoenas.  This IS obstruction of justice, ergo Trump IS GUILTY of obstruction of justice.

Meanwhile, even before any evidence was made public, Senate Republicans like Mitch McConnell and Lindsay Graham have publicly and repeatedly stated that they WILL excuse Trump, will REFUSE to look at ANY evidence.  If this were ANY court trial in the nation, both McConnell and Graham would be REMOVED from the jury for political bias.

&amp;#x200B;

SO...

&amp;#x200B;

Speaker Nancy Pelosi is well within her rights to withhold sending the two articles of impeachment to the corrupt Senate at this time.
[comment]Can the Muller report now, be damaging enough to put him in jail? Now that he has been impeached by the house.
[comment]I would like to see Pelosi announce that they are going to bend over backwards and give Trump the month of January to allow witnesses. At the same time, as evidence comes in, more articles of impeachment should be added.

Bill Clinton was investigated over a land deal in Arkansas which had nothing to do with his presidency or national security. Trump should be impeached over the Trump Foundation.
[comment]Lol fair trial like this whole impeachment situation was a "fair" trial🤣🤣🤣🤫🤫🤫
[comment]So wait, she is withholding something until she gets what she wants?   Lady learns from the best.
[comment]Do you people actually believe that 3/4 of the senate will vote to oust Trump? This will be a repeat of 1998 where the senate acquitted President Clinton.
[comment]A fair Senate trial is one where they wipe their ass with the impeachment articles.

Well, we've been trying for years to get the Ukraine President to just say we're looking into the Biden's. So ya, we had to acquitt so no more people would get outted. Graham is the most worried.  Mitch is concerned Graham will find McCain  I mean God again. Other than that how's you?
[comment]TL;DR: Cipollone was in the room when Trump ordered the pressure plan, along with Mulvaney, Bolton, and Giuliani. Dems could ask Roberts to remove him due to rules, and/or ask to make him testify.
[comment]Wow, even more corrupt... Who knew... Who cares... What difference does it make...🙄
[comment]Even if Bolton testifies, we have months and months before we get to conviction. Just looks at John Dean’s testimony. It took 12 months to get to Nixon’s removal.
[comment]Arggggghhhh when will this nightmare end????
[comment]I think at this point the bastards are just laughing at everyone who couldn't stop them.

They know they won this round, so they're mocking everyone who tried to stop them.

[comment]My favorite is when Cpt. Obvious says "The cold makes him... a little "horse". Gets me every time.
[comment]Trump is 12 yard school hard bully in a old man. 
Very bizarre and pathetic.
[comment]Because he *doesn't* lead a nation.  He takes orders from Moscow and then makes shit up on Twitter the rest of the day.
[comment]Trump is truly an inferior being to be called a person
[comment]The useful idiot isn't nor has ever been a 'leader'. He's a carnival barker who was in the wrong place for all the wrong reasons. The barker is merely a tool to bring in the rubes.
[comment]He’s a dope. He’s not pandering to his idiot base. He’s actually part of his idiot base.
[comment]*“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are — nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought? — but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us, this is horrible.”*  

—Donald J. Trump
[comment]But he said he has the best words.
[comment]Trump talks exactly like an AM radio/televangelist right wing crazy. They have been yammering away like this and conning the chumps with this shit for so many decades now it all seems normal and acceptable to a goodly percent of Americans. President Trump talks just like Mark Levin. Politics for angry 12 year olds.
[comment]Not surprised to see such a stupid article in the Democrats sub. Y’all are utterly hopeless.

Hate clearly has a permanent home here.
[comment]I’d consider myself center right but nothing makes me laugh like listening to those montages of trump messing up words. I really get a kick out of the “billions and billions and billions” iykyk
[comment]Ya think?
[comment]You don't have to be a language expert to have the ability to see that Trump is an inferior person.  You just have to be better than inferior yourself.
[comment]You small and silly people need to begin keeping your eye on the real ball.
[comment]I do kinda wish he'd stop using the same adjectives. He uses them over and over it's very very bad speech. Repetitive speech is sloppy and he could pick up a thesaurus and expand his vocabulary a little bit.
[comment]Trump is a truly inferior person ~~to be leading a nation~~

FTFY
[comment]This is what happens when inferior people have a voice. Take it away and silence them for good in 2020. Lock Them Out.
[comment]John McWhorter has a podcast called Lexicon Valley, which covers linguistics. Cool to see him in the news every so often.
[comment]This is very biased. How can this be a news article when you’re basing a personal opinion on the news title?
[comment]I'm a middle school teacher and I discipline my kids for behavior that Trump does regularly. Name call, bully, lie, incite violence.
[comment]If the gene pool were a barrel you can consider the bottom of it thouroughly  scraped when it comes to a speciman like DJT. No, love him or hate him one look or listen  tells you evolution did not do him (or the unhappy world further troubled by his existence) any favors.
[comment]This article is dumb for the simple reason Trump’s dumbed down communication style is incredibly effective for him. 

His opponents should be so lucky to communicate so effectively.
[comment]the only reason he even managed to build an empire was because of his daddy’s money.  he doesn’t understand the plight and challenges 99.9% of americans face. an awful excuse for a human, let alone a president.
[comment]The problem with impeaching Trump for his illegal actions against Joe Biden, shows that the establishment didn't really care about stopping Trump until he hurt them. When he was indirectly killing people it was fine, but suddenly when he tries to stop the Democratic establishment from taking power and serving their constituents (billionaires) they decide to impeach him in vain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]The Hillary Clinton emails story comes to an end: One of the worst media screw-ups in history, and nobody seems to have learned anything. The email story shows how double standards can develop and then produce shockingly unfair coverage in ways that absolutely affect the outcome of the race.
[selftext]https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/21/hillary-clinton-emails-story-comes-an-end/[comment]Trump will continue to whine about those emails though.
[comment]Media need to learn the difference between people who know things and people who don’t know shit, and quit reporting the opinions of ignorant people as if they knew something.
[comment]How about the cover up or non story related to fixing the primaries. Debbie wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton got what they deserved. Bernie should have been the candidate. He had momentum and the support of millennials. Dems lost because they fixed the race to get the candidate that would provide the least amount of change.
[comment]I never cared about the emails. I don’t like HRC for a multitude of other reasons.

I don’t care about the Ukraine Biden thing either. I don’t like Biden for other reasons.

#justsaynotoneoliberalism
[comment]Expect Fox news to still be talking about her emails for at least the next year.
[comment]That story will never come to an end.
[comment]Can SOMEONE PLEASE INTERVIEW TREY GOWDY!!! Ask him if he chose not to run because HE KNEW that his cooked-up sack of steamed shit sandwich was a blast lot to discredit Clinton and the Democratic party!!

[comment]This but people still call trump a russian agent. There is no bias just partisan shit throwing in both directions.
[comment]This will only end when Republicans become obsessed over a new Clinton pseudo-scandal to replace it.
[comment]Media did not screw up. 

Media owned by rich republicans who are happy to let everyone believe the "liberal media" myth, will put the email stories on the front page of the paper for years.

NYT ran the conclusion to the email investigation on page 16.

Doesn't that tell you all you need to know about the "liberal media"?
[comment]She's a fuckin evil lizard person and you all know it
[comment]!!!!The crooked one!!!!

/S
[comment]It reminds me of WMD in Iraq, but in reverse. First Fox News aggressively asserted WMD was in Iraq even after it became pretty obvious they weren’t there. Once it was official that there was no evidence of WMD they stop talking about it altogether except for the occasional pundit touting some unverifiable conspiracy theory about how they were moved or hidden. Now, fast forward into the future and they speak about as if everyone knows it and use it as a reason Trump pulls out of Syria and wherever else. “We now know we never should have been there.” 

It’s going to be the same with Hillary’s emails. One day someone is going to want to investigate Trump’s email server and they’ll use Hillary as an example of how an innocent person can get thrown under the bus by the media so everyone should just drop it. If not Fox directly, some other GOP propaganda proxy.
[comment]They haven't learned anything because, as usual, the Democrats let this faux controversy get out of control.  

This happens time and again and the Left still has no answer to wild and crazy accusations from the GOP which end up getting a life of their own that won't die.

How many times will the Dems allow themselves to be character assassinated before they actually do something about it?

This happened with Hillary, with Obama and Kenya, with John Kerry and his military record, a generation back with Dukakis and the infamous Willy Horton ad and on and on and on. All this shit happens because the Dems are too timid to attack the Right and they foolishly think that the American people are woke enough to know the difference between right wing propaganda and the truth.
[comment]Nobody learned anything? It worked exactly as planned. They learned it works.
[comment]It wasn't a screw-up.  They were helping Trump to make it a tighter race when his polls were in the dumps.

It's what they always do, and still are doing.
[comment]More than anything else the media gave Trump free press and anti-Hillary conspiracy theories free press.
[comment]It isn't an article; it's an opinion piece.
[comment]Almost as bad as RUSSIAN COLLUSION!
[comment]Wait, the world is unfair? Wtf is this bullshit. I demand an arbitrary line to be drawn to that helps the subjectively decided dispossessed. No matter what possible consequences everything is on the table because we are fighting for fairness!

<|startoftext|>[title]Hillary Clinton: Richard Nixon once made this argument: "When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal." He was forced to resign in disgrace. In America, no one is above the law.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1222905260215324672?s=09[comment]I love you Hil, but you're wrong.  We've seen three years of evidence that Trump is above the law.  And tomorrow, after McConnell has the vote to disallow witnesses, he'll immediately call for an acquittal vote.  And then it will be codified into law that Trump can truly do whatever he wants if it will get him re-elected.  That *is* his lawyers argument as of Wednesday.  It's over.  It's all over.
[comment]I agree, but Hilary isn't the one to say it lmfao
[comment]God, I wish she would shut up. Has Obama chimed in and opined constantly? No, because he's a dignified person.
[comment]It’s over comrades - they’ll be jailing journalists next.
[comment]Dershowitz talks like someone has kompromat on him. He didn't talk like this before he wrote that book.

I have a feeling that all the kompromat will get released when these idiots prove themselves no longer useful.
[comment]Can she not just go the fuck away...
[comment]Its pretty clear no one is above the law, except for rich white Republican officer holders.
[comment]A lot of people are above the law to differing degrees
[comment]The audacity.
[comment]Sorry you worship the horrible Clinton who lost to the worst political candidate in history.
[comment]No one is above the law, including Hillary who is currently dodging a process server.
[comment]Wow, she said something genuine for once
[comment]&gt;In America, no one is above the law.  
  
I think we're all about to find out that isn't true anymore. Again. Just like with the Panama papers. Or after the 2008 financial crisis. Or when Epstein got away with it over and over again.
[comment]Apparently , not sure how Republicans Senators so can be so complicit.  Actually many are a lot more than complicit.   This type of complicity is what led to the rise of the Nazis and the Holocaust.

How do Republican Americans fall in line with this ?   Are their minds that susceptible to propoganda?
[comment]Call your senator at (202) 224-3121 and tell them we want witnesses.
[comment]I'm too young to know first hand, but Nixon was already out of office when he said this, wasn't he? Wasn't it during the Frost/Nixon interview?

I think that tells you everything you need to know about how far standards have fallen. Nixon at least had the decency to resign.
[comment]Vote blue no matter who.
[comment]Except King Donald I. Who, thanks to #moscowmitch actually IS above the law.
[comment]&gt; **In America, no one is above the law.** 

I think we're finding out thats not entirely true if the criminal controls most of the branches of government.
[comment]I have a hunch that they are now.
[comment]Above the law? No. Two different sets of consequences dependent upon class? Yes.
[comment]Hillary saying no one is above the law. That's just beautiful.
[comment]He choose to resign.   Also that was when there was an actual republican party ...not just an offshoot of the president. 

Also Clinton and co committed multiple crimes but never was criminally punished and neither was Nixon so fuck these criminals who never paid fines or faced time when if any one of us did half of what rhey dis we'd be serving life or financially ruined.

It is there corruption which paved the way for people like trump.  It was America's disillusionment and dissatisfaction with politicians like Nixon and Clinton that allowed self proclaimed swamp drainer trump to rise to power.  Clinton is a disgrace.  Nixon was a disgrace.  Obama is the only half decent president I've ever seen and even he has a lot to answer for.  Until out leaders start actually represent the majority over the 0.1% nothing will change.
[comment]DEAR HILLARY.  PLEASE JUST GTF AWAY.  YOU ARE DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD TO THE CAUSE.  GO SIT ON YOUR PORCH IN YOUR ADIRONDACK ROCKING CHAIR COUNTING YOUR MILLIONS IN WALL STREET SPEAKER FEES.  goddamn sigh..................
[comment]No one is above the law, but the dictator can and does shit on it.
[comment]This statement is now false.  So long as he has the Senators to back him up the president *is* above the law and can commit any crime he likes, up to and including treason.

[comment]ain't gonna get shit done with the turtle in the senate anyway. the House should go wall-to-wall Trump Crime Network.
[comment]Rip him apart constantly screw the Senate eventually he will go insane and be carted off to happy acres.
[comment]I feel if something is not done about his clear abuse of power soon then we will have an ignorant billion dollar dictator on our hands.
[comment]They can already make another article of impeachment since Its a federal crime to retaliate against someone for being a witness or testifying.
[comment]Keep the pressure on till the toddler in chief snaps. Lock him up, lock him up!
[comment]Hopefully he loses the election and they still go after him. He's a slob who really should be in prison for some of the crap he has pulled.
[comment]Impeach again.
[comment]Good! They can't just sit there and say "well we tried, time to twiddle our thumbs". They need to keep up investigating and kee0ing track of every little thing  

My question is, at what point does it become an international problem that requires a response?
[comment]Impeach over and over.
[comment]Impeached him every month
[comment]Impeach him again.
[comment]Impeach again, again and again!  Plenty of charges to bring up.
[comment]Trump should create a special division of the police for his own protection and maybe arrest a few democrat leaders with it.
[comment]Impeachment round 2... firing witnesses.
[comment]Give it up. Just try to win in November. It’s been 3 years of wasted time. Focus on doing something good!
[comment]Considering Hillary Clinton was investigated almost constantly for 25 years, I don't see any problem in dragging Trump through the mud for the duration of his presidency. It worked out pretty well for Republicans in 2016.
[comment]This douche was guilty twenty years ago
[comment]Good. He should be in prison.
[comment]Of course they are. And their utter cluelessness is going to get us four more years of that embarrassing buffoon.
[comment]Trump’s post-impeachment approval numbers are the highest they’ve been since a month after he took office.

Democrats are going to blow it because their assinine obsession, and we’re going to be stuck with that buffoon for four more years.

[comment]Vote by mail increases voter turnout.  Demand vote by mail with free postage. Like Oregon and Washington states.
[comment]Republicans lose when Dems show up to vote.
[comment]👎👎👎👎👎👎
[comment]And they vote for Biden. BIDEN ALREADY HAD A CHANCE TO FIX THIS AND HE DIDN’T DO IT!
[comment]To think if this didn't happen, Texas would have a Democratic senator and possibly Governor right now.
[comment] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBAsFwPglw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBAsFwPglw)
[comment]I get your point, but Texas had ample time to vote early, I voted two weeks ago and was the only one in the polling station. 

However, we did have people in line until 11:00 PM to vote.
[comment]House needs to investigate.
[comment]There were also plenty of reports of polling stations where they had separate machines for Democrat and Republicans and often fewer for Democrats and even though there were virtually no Republican primary voters Dems were not allowed to use those machines "because they are reserved".  Even airlines get that when the coach lines are long and no biz or first class passengers are around they can help everyone.
[comment]Good news is that more democrats cast ballots in 2020 than 2016 by a lot (1.94M vs 1.4M).  So part of the line problem was higher turnout.  Bring it Texas. And it happened in the primary so hopefully more voters are aware and vote early.
[comment]Didn't this happen under Obama's administration?
[comment]I'm laughing at the "stay classy, Texas" comment. If you think they give a damn about perception you're crazy. POWER is the only thing that matters to the GOP. Consolidated, and held onto with a death grip. If you want to see any real change with this nonsense, you have to beat them at their game by winning elections and then changing the rules like they do. Obviously the goal is to ensure the Darkies don't vote, but the working poor are just as disenfranchised. Plan out your polling place for November now. Let your kids stay home or take election day off this year. It's THAT serious. Or.... complain about Trump and Mitch McConnell until Jan 20th, 2025.
[comment]That's crazy. I was in and out in about 2 minutes. But I live in a blue state that wants everyone to vote.
[comment]And its only going to get worse as my fellow Bernie people say "I wont vote if its Biden!"  No, fucking vote and save the Supreme Court you dumbasses!
[comment]I think we should have a database or a roster that we can reference with our voter reg number to see what was recorded as our vote as a public resource.
[comment]Isn’t early voting a thing? Are they just incompetent or irresponsible?
[comment]Voter suppression is a serious problem, but I wish more people would blame Congress instead of the Supreme Court. A lot of states with the most impactful voter supression (e.g., Ohio, North Carolina, and Wisconsin) weren't even covered by section 5 because it was based on 1960s activities instead of modern day ones. We need to pass the VRA again only subject every state to the preclearance requirement.
[comment]Texas
[comment]This is blatent class warfare it is the rich trying to stay rich and keeping the poor poorer, everyone get out and vote for Bernie Sanders to end this oppression. #OnlyBernieBeatsTrump2020
[comment]The optimistic skeptic in me wants to know if this is also because turnout is higher than usual...
[comment]That's why I vote early.
[comment]Vote for Biden!  He'll make sure to do nothing about that, right away!
[comment]sucks this happened for those people. I never would have expected it. my voting experience was pretty mundane. I saw a sign while driving that says voting this way. followed it. it was at a middle school so it felt really odd to say the least. I almost felt like I was trespassing because there was nobody there( it was during school hours). It was a little empty, I got greeted by the 4 or 5 people there. Checked in with my id then voted. I didn't know who over half the people I was asked to choose were so I picked based on who's name I liked most. I was the only one there but a few more came on the way out. fort worth area.
[comment]I’m sure they are pushing to close another 250 and require a third piece of identification .
[comment]Also something that Biden wont change if elected president. He had 4 years to push for reform and did nothing about it.
[comment]Biden was VP during this time and he and Obama did nothing about it.

It’s still not close to some peoples wages, especially working on higher Saturday, Sunday, and public holiday rates, but it’s something and it’s happening now that hundreds of thousands of people just got notice on Monday (our time) that all non essential business must not remain open nation wide, unless for takeaway, so people at least have this safety net to fall back on, no questions asked.
[comment]DONT TAX ME ON THIS BAILOUT!
[comment]Hey Democrats!!

The GOP is trying to control the narrative on these bills...it's already started on CNN.

I suggest that you get on r/politics as much as you can and start DIRECTLY confronting misinformation posts  about these bills.

[comment]On lefty reddit it’s fairly accepted that anyone who voted for Bernie in the primary is also voting for Biden in the general for the sake of the country. Anyone who says they’re sitting it out or voting third party gets scolded on this website. But on lefty Facebook it’s the complete opposite case. I’ve currently got at least a few dozen people screeching at me over a comment I made where I said despite volunteering/voting for Bernie in the primary I’ll be voting for Biden in November.
[comment]Wow. It’s pretty incredible to hear Chomsky ally with a centrist Dem. Shit is real when Chomsky is telling people to vote for the centrist.
[comment]I definitely do not support trump, but jesus christ reddit..? comparing him to the nazis? Absolutely ridiculous
[comment]Everyone should be legally required to vote. If they don’t like Biden, then write in someone. Or just fucking vote for trump if you think he’s not as bad as most people know he is. But whatever...just vote!!
[comment]Or maybe, not voting for trump amounts to not voting for trump, maybe?
[comment] they always want us to bend to their will.  When was the last time there was a liberal president?  tell me why i should keep voting for a group that does not want the same things as me? if trump wins it will destroy the democrats and i don't see that as a bad thing a more liberal party will rise
[comment]Essentially, there are two types of progressives.

1. NeverBidens
2. Those who will ally with Democrats because we believe we will have the numbers to take the party over inside 10 years.

There are many, many more 2s than 1s. The 1s are just loud on the internet. Don’t worry, Biden will be elected.
[comment]Social Democrats literally killed Communists back then. Look at what happened to Rosa Luxemburg.
[comment]Lol comparing republicans and Trump to Nazis is so sensationalist that you lose independents like me. 

Another comment hit it on the head though. The Trump admin has already gotten several SC picks. With another term he will likely get another two. RBGs health is very questionable. I doubt she makes it on the court another 4.5 years. 

What are the chances the convention pushes a new candidates like Cuomo? I just wish there were someone else...
[comment]Talk like that is exactly how dems lost the last election. Time to stop trying to guilt people into a vote.

Many liberal voters vote for *moral* reasons. If they they see two candidates that they think are immoral it's unfair to chastise them for not voting for either even if one is arguably "the lesser of two evils" - evil is still evil. Now, I'm not saying that Biden is necessarily an immoral candidate, but from a morality point of view his positions on "the war on terror" in both the Bush and Obama administrations arguably are.

Now, I was too young to vote at the time, but I think I would have considered voting for Bill Clinton immoral - at least because of what's plainly known about him in hindsight.
[comment]I feel like this, "if your not with me your against me", mentality needs to stop. If we advocate for another political party with our votes, say the Libertarian party, it would make it less likely we vote for one of two terrible candidates. They are both bad, why not vote for another party that could being a good candidate in the future? Biden likely won't win anyways due to him advocating for gun confiscation and his very likely dementia.
[comment]The old geriatric Democrats who have retained their leadership positions are always blaming everybody else when they don't get the needed votes to win. This blame shifting has got to stop. Biden's campaign has failed to sincerely reach across the table and offer the ever-growing progressives wing of Democrats any meaningful reason to support a Republican-lite platform.

What does Biden and the 1990s Blue Dog Democrats expect? Adoration and enthusiasm while doing nothing for your constituents?

Biden is responsible for attracting voters to his cause. Biden needs to do a reality check on his campaign. Hillary certainly did not comprehend the dire situation her campaign for President was in. Biden better comprehend what it takes for voters to embrace Biden's candicency for President.

It is NOT good enough to simply demand progressives vote for Biden. Progressives are worried about real issues like the 10 year time frame before irreversible and dire climate events. Insulting progressives for pie in the sky demands on Climate change is a sure way of losing votes. Demanding that progressives vote for Biden while openly flouting future climate change disaster is beyond irrational, its crazy.
[comment]It’s true. I do completely understand the hesitation, especially from progressives. IMO Biden seems like a crazy choice from among the democratic candidate field we had but here we are. Sure, I didn’t get what I wanted, again, but something else I *really* want is Trump the fuck out of my government. This is the only possible way to do it now. So, let’s fucking do it.
[comment]I agree with this post.  Trump is the "Danger of our Times" and must be voted out.  When Biden gets in we can hold his feet to the fire with things we don't agree with.  But the Supreme Court pick (or at least stopping Mcconnell from approving another arch-conservative one and more other judges) and every Cabinet position i.e. the entire Federal Administration will be light-years better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Trump’s Plan For Coronavirus Second Wave Shows He’s Learned Absolutely Nothing

[comment]What does learning have to do with Trump’s attempts to win the 2020 election?

Why do so many of us liberals make the mistake of thinking Republicans are stupid or just don’t get it.

They get it.

They just have different priorities and plans than you.
[comment]What is the "actual" plan for Coronavirus wave two? Shut everything down again just as it is getting back up to speed? That would be a disaster.
[comment]At this point I believe their intent is to let this run free and let the chips fall where they may. Herd immunity....terms that found their use in vetrinary medicine to describe the status of cultivated groups of animals intended for consumption. Ironic.

[comment]But... Susan Collins...
[comment]I can’t imagine the destruction if he gets another 4 years. We’re in shambles now...
[comment]Republicans abandoned the concept of governance a couple decades ago because they came to the conclusion there is a risk of more government involved with government.  The priority became maintaining power for profits from there.

Their new motto became: "Government is bad and doesn't work.  Elect me and I'll prove it!"

They'll spend your tax dollars in response to chaos that puts their power in peril.  That spending will go to the private sector, for sure.  The cost will be a hundred dollars when it would have cost a dollar to be prepared for the chaos like Democrats recommended as a philosophy.  It costs way less money to prepare than it does to spend amongst chaos.  After all, they never let a good disaster go to waste.  Chaos is profitable.

New Federalism needs to be dead and buried with the election and year of 2020.
[comment]Has anyone considered that even if the economy comes back close to normal, his instability is what will get him voted out?  He seems to be betting the health of every citizen that the economy's recovery alone will suffice. 

I suppose America might discount his manic nature, but that seems unlikely.
[comment]Time to eliminate this viral lie spreader.
[comment]Learning requires acknowledging you didn’t already know, which he is incapable of doing.
[comment]Trump learning something about anything would be a precedent by itself.
[comment]Of course he hasn’t. Trump doesn’t learn. 

The problem here isn’t that he’s not preparing for wave 2. It’s that he doesn’t seem to want to prepare for any scenario. There are several scenarios possible including ongoing slow burn and intermittent waves and he’s not ready for any of them. 

Every scenario ends with him unprepared. It’s bad.
[comment]Hell he showed he learned nothing when they asked him what he'd do differently and he said nothing.  The man has no conscience, nor soul. He's a lost, damned husk of a man if ever i saw one.
[comment]Were already seeing the second wave.  August and September we will be at 200,000 dead.
[comment]His plan is he has no plan, sorry trumptards but the end is near...😆
[comment]He's learned to blame everyone and anything else...
[comment]He learned he can kill 100,000 americans for his pal putin without lifting a hand #TrimpGenocide of America
[comment]We Democrats need to stop with the 2nd wave crap. Wave 1 is on a major upswing yet again and there is just going to be one big, long lasting wave until there is a vaccine or Biden gets in and mandates risk reduction practices.
[comment]Truthfully? He is incapable of learning. I’m sure his grades reflect that (if we were allowed to see them).
[comment]Ssshhh...just let it happen, man! They wanna go out, fuck it. Let em. They have now volunteered as tributes to the second wave. And Trump will have to walk back everything. Again.
[comment]“If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, you ain’t black”.
[comment]He is responsible for a lot more than 36,000 deaths. He didn't respond fast enough. And when he did he did an half ass job. And now he is pushing to reopen the country when the country isn't ready. As the number of deaths grow his share of the dead grows. By the time the plague is over he will be personally responsible for hundreds of thousands of death.
[comment]This headline exemplifies the soft democrat mentality. We are almost 4 years into this and every story is written in the context of, oh look he hasn't learned his lesson, what about next time? No, fucking directly attack him every god damn time and blame his ass for it all.

<|startoftext|>[title]U.S. jobless rate has already broken Great Depression records — and most media missed it
[selftext]https://www.salon.com/2020/05/15/us-jobless-rate-has-already-broken-great-depression-records--and-most-media-missed-it_partner/[comment]What a depressing time we live in.  It's too dangerous for most people to go to work.
[comment]Death "sell" more than unemployment numbers. Watch any news broadcast on TV and compare how much time they give to crime, deadly accidents etc., compared to more positive things.
[comment]Trump is trying to control the news cycle. He needs something new everyday. That's what he's trying to create a fake Obama administration scandal. If the news is focused on that, they aren't covering the 2000 dead Americans every day. Or the 20% unemployment.
[comment]Thanks Trump!
[comment]Every Democrat needs to talk about this constantly. And the gdp numbers too. 

Obviously could too, but it's all important.
[comment]Most media is missing a lot. For the past month or more, most news outlets were "reporting" about a few hundred so-called protesters deciding states needed to open because their Leader told them so.

Meanwhile, Trump's federal government were seizing so many state's ordered protective equipment, that those states were having to find tricks arms dealers use to hide orders from our own national government.

Did any of you see any broadcast news channel cover it? I didn't.

The newsmedia have consistently focused on all the wrong things for several years now, but since Trump's been in office they've been played, day after day, week after week.

What's truly frightening though, is that as bad as they've become at informing the public of what we need to know, imagine waking up tomorrow and finding out Barr's justice department has brought multiple federal charges against cnn and msnbc and forcing them to shut down all but state approved news broadcasts. 

Too far? You think so? Look back over the past year at everything that's happened, that if you told us would happen four years ago, we would have said *couldn't* happen. But it did.

The only way we can be ready for what Trump and the GOP *will* do before November to keep Trump in office, is to make your imagination"go to as dark a place as you can. Because I promise you, they'll go there.
[comment]You think maybe there's a difference since the current unemployment is by design and the great depression was a failure of the system?
[comment]There's four times more liquidity in the stock market and as long as rich people aren't going poor, the word "Depression" isn't used in the media.  /s
[comment]Thank God we don't have debt that will cripple a generation of fiscally responsible elected leaders.  /s
[comment]Because Republicans are never held responsible for the consequences of their economic policies.
[comment]A global health pandemic makes us stay home and raises unemployment rates. Was that so unusual that jobless rates would reach historic levels? Maybe the media had common sense enough to know this was going to happen and didn’t need to state the obvious?
[comment]Anything that comes out of the dear leaders mouth you can't believe but things coming out of the government pertaining to jobs or the virus you have to think of it  being 30 to 50% worse, I can't believe I have to say that it makes me sound like Faux news.
[comment]It's possible that the media was going with the lower (but still the worst since the Great Depression) unemployment rate because the higher rate would be based on a decision, beginning in March, to reclassify workers absent from work due to coronavirus as unemployed.

The change in methodology, while perhaps useful in terms of understanding where we really stand in some respects,  and a logical enough adaption for a measurement not designed for an epidemic like this, makes comparisons with past economic conditions based on the traditional unemployment methodology problematic and may run counter to what people understand the measurement to mean.

I think it is enough to measure things the "old" way and announce an employment rate of 14.7% instead of doing it the 2020 way and announcing a measurement of 19.7%.

The last President to preside over a dip in the unemployment rate to 14.7% was Hebert Hoover (A Republican), at the beginning of the First Republican Great Depression.  The closest 21st century equivalent is when George W. Bush (a Republican) presided over the Great Recession.  Now, Donald Trump (A Republican.  Notice a pattern in party identification?) is presiding over a dip that may surpass both of them.

Some might say that it's unfair to blame a President for the economic consequences of an epidemic that is unprecedented in US history, which I might agree with if not for the fact that Trump is partially responsible for the epidemic getting this bad here.  Trump had a 69 page game plan for this hypothetical with smart non-partisan guidance in, all passed on to him from the Obama administration, and he didn't read or implement any of it.  Trump refused to take what his own advisors and health organizations were telling him about coronavirus, and publicly downplayed it's seriousness while privately not taking necessary steps to prepare or contain it, so it got a lot worse than it had to be, and now he is encouraging state and local governments to open up prematurely, which will virtually ensure a second wave of this that will be worse than the first wave (It's incubating and spreading asymptotically as things open back up, and then a second wave will hit us badly- either in a few weeks if this virus continues to thrive in summer conditions, or in the fall if it doesn't), though I don't think the first wave is by any means complete yet regardless.

So, I think it is fair to blame Trump for the economic problem considering he was partially responsible for the virus problem being as bad as it is, and that's what's causing the economic problems.  I would accept an argument that he isn't *completely* responsible, since we would have faced some sort of smaller issue with this virus even with a better President in office and that would have resulted in some sort of much smaller economic downturn, but at least 50% of this is on Trump, and I am being generous in that assessment.  It's probably much higher.

Anyhow, I think the lower unemployment number with a footnote is bad enough and probably a good one to use, because it's virtually indisputable, and bad enough.  If we use the high number with no caveats, we'll be accused of cooking the books, and there'll be this whole side debate about metholodogy, and the underlying point will be lost, which is, no matter how you slice it, this is the worst economy in almost a century and Trump is presiding over it.

Maybe we should begin to raise the trademark challenger question of "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?".  If people ask themselves that when they vote, and base their votes on the answer, Biden will win.  Not everyone will do that, and I anticipate this being a tough election that could either way, but it may be something we want to place in the back of people's heads- it may be decisive in our favor for some swing voters.

We can't quite run on the old Bill Clinton "It's the economic, stupid" tag-line where he beat George H.W. Bush (A Republican), who was presiding over a recession in 1992, because we don't want to imply that the economy is more important than public health right now.  I would certainly be talking about economics if I were a candidate for public office right now, though, especially if I were Biden- not exclusively or as a main focus, but in the top 3 topics.

Elizabeth Warren as VP would help a lot with Biden's ability to do economic based planning and messaging that appeals to his base.  They could almost run a dual campaign where Biden runs as statesperson who embraces expertise, science, truth, justice, tradition, freedom, democracy, and the American way, and wants to restore our relationships with our allies and make sure Russia and China face consequences for their interference in our elections and domestic affairs, and Warren runs as the one throwing punches on the economy (Both with plans, moderated by Biden but still clearly with her as their driving force, and with critiques of what Trump is doing wrong and how much it is hurting regular folks economically) and the way Trump treats women.  Both would be able to fundraise and attract groups from different, but complementary, groups.  They would need to coordinate and make sure their messaging is consistent and no one is saying anything they can't both embrace, but they certainly could have their own areas of special focus in the campaign.

I also think, quite frankly, when it comes to governing, if you put Biden and Warren at the head of a table with a variety of experts, between the two of them and their advisors, you might get an almost ideal administration by the time they constructively debate the issues and have evidentiary based compromise solutions to present.  Larry Summers doesn't bother me that much if he has to sit across from Elizabeth Warren as he would if he wound up surrounded by people who aren't as strong of a voice for the other side of the Democratic Party's spectrum on economic issues as Warren is.
[comment]Shhh, be vewy, vewy quiet. It’s middle class huntin’ seasun.

[comment]Don't worry - the Eternal Regime will just redefine employment as being white.
[comment]It's already too late for a significant number of small businesses. They're never coming back. We may see an extended recession for a few years at least. I'm worried about Dems being too associated with the lockdowns, and getting blamed for a bad economy, while all the people whose lives were saved my the lockdown won't even realize it. Ex post facto there will be a lot of questioning whether it was all worth it, especially as the enormous cost comes into view. I'd be careful about being caught on the wrong side of this. Sure, I know what the polls say now. High support for lockdowns will fade.

[comment]Very interesting!  I’d say the most fascinating things is what high percentages of non voters say they lean third party. If everyone voted, might we have a third party?
[comment]There is something wrong with those people unless they seriously CANNOT. It’s not an issue of whether or not you like a candidate or not. Right now it’s just important to elect someone who will respect the law and the constitution.

[comment]Voter apathy campaigns are real and they work.
[comment]Most Americans are super uninformed and dont bother making any attempt at educating themselves
[comment]Well, about half of Americans don't think, so there's that.
[comment]They just don't care. All these diatribes about work and disaffection are BS. They aren't entertained or or interested so they don't bother trying to figure out who they want to vote for. Their friends and family don't vote, so there's no social pressure and they don't watch or read the news. They just don't care.
[comment]Bernie Bros seem to think they can motivate the stay at home voters - I bloody well hope so because we need a crushing defeat so the resident parasite cannot claim it was rigged and refuse to leave.
[comment]First a lot of them arent able to vote.

Second what exactly is going to convince them to do it? The popular vote doesnt matter at all anyway and each district is basically already decided before any voting even starts.

I always vote but I can understand how people feel like it just doesnt matter.
[comment]This year this could possibly happen:

If you’re republican and don’t like trump u don’t have any other choices = probably won’t  vote

If your a democrat your candidate can be on one extreme end of the party or the other.   So if Bernie wins most of the Bloomberg supporters won’t vote and vice versa
[comment]Maybe they don’t vote because the electoral college deters them from doing so?
[comment]If you walk into a room filled with one hundred random strangers, you can pretty much guarantee that at least half of ‘em are gonna be dipshits. Same goes for the general population. Question answered.
[comment]Since I've been able to vote the GOP has stolen two elections and the world around me continues to become worse.

I fail to see how voting is effective, I won't participate in this country, I'd rather just live in my own bubble and watch everything and ultimately my self burn because it'll happen anyway.
[comment]Lots of people are very self-centered and think of something doesn't impact them, it doesn't matter.  Lots of young people I know in particular - as long as they have their drinks and their music, they're good.
[comment]I want to caution everyone in these comments from generalizing that people don't vote because they are lazy, uneducated, disinterested, or apathetic.

While this can certainly be said for some people, many many thousands of people who should be able to vote and want to cannot because of widespread voter disenfranchisement. We cannot pretend that our government actually cares about fair voting practices despite protections for it in our constitution.

Of course we need a more engaged electorate. We need schools to register young people to vote and educate them on how they can do this in college. We should absolutely not stop trying to engage the unengaged. But to perpetuate a narrative that these are the only reasons why people don't vote is irresponsible and let's the government get away with what they are doing.
[comment]Friendly reminder that there is active voter disenfranchisement in this country that *prevents* citizens from voting as well.
[comment]I hope most blacks and Hispanics will not vote in November and that white conservatives will come out in force to re-elect Donald Trump.
[comment]How could you not vote for Sanders or against trump???  To not vote should be in some way illegal.  If you don't want to vote you should vote to not vote but still show your enguagment.<|endoftext|>

But Biden should pick the woman who would bring in the most votes for broadest victory in the Presidential and the Senate races.  If Warren would bring out more young people to vote for the ticket than Whitman would win over center-right voters, then Warren should be picked.   (And one can even argue for Warren over someone like Whitman if Whitman would turn out anti-Trump Rs who vote for Rs for the Senate.  We want these split ticketers to just not vote.).  The only one absolute no-no is a senator from a competitive or Republican state.

[comment]Funny how no he doesn't, at least not for months, and may just refuse outright regardless of court cases. This will immediately be appealed to the SCOTUS, who will probably decline to hear it. But, this is their tactic. Delay, distract, deny. Over and over and over. These are the actions of criminals.

I mean we have been here before. Who will enforce the court ruling? Barr is not going to do that. It's a dictatorship. The president can do whatever and no one can do anything about it.

[comment]A lot of people prefer Biden.  They will be doing very well economically if Dump gets elected again.  They aren't willing to be taxed to the max and have the stock market slump with Bernie.  They are more likely to not vote at all if Bernie gets the nomination.  Most of these people are considerably less affluent than the 1%.  Most of them aren't even worth more than $50k on paper.  I hate Dump and his shit show, but I will have a VERY hard time voting for Bernie.  

Almost everything he proposes is a taxpayer's handout to the lower and middle classes.  He wants to penalize businesses and people that worked hard to achieve something beyond a middle class existence.  Very little of his never ending wish list of handouts has a realistic chance of passing Congress.  I can't vote for pipe dreams.  

Having said that, I don't understand why Black voters couldn't rally behind Bernie if they had to.  In terms of socio-economics, Bernie **should** appeal to most of the Blacks.  Perhaps someone Blacker than me can explain why Bernie is bad for them?  BTW, my shade is coffee with cream.  Mixed race.

[comment]There are some of us that are grateful for and realize the difficulty of what you do for us so "THANK YOU!!" Stay safe and keep protesting!
[comment]You are an essential employee...like myself(healthcare). You should be protesting this dickhead. All he cares about is his billionaire buddies...and by default...himself.

[comment]Thank you brotha, please tell your fellow truckers to call into news stations and clarify if they have not.  We need a lot of White House protests in general would love to see thousands of cars honking for the left and sensible America.
[comment]My great grandfather was a teamster enforcer in the 1930s. I was told they did some harsh things. I judged him harshly for it. But now I can see why - trucker wages have decline drastically since 1980.
[comment]Thanks for driving all of our stuff all over the place! You are honestly what makes the world go round. Keep fighting!
[comment]The idea of Trump looking out “for the little guy” when his ass cheeks are pressed firmly against toilet seats of gold is stupid.

Thank you for being woke and doing the essential work you do!
[comment]Thanks, man.  The truth will come out.  He despises truckers.  He only sees value in those who grovel to him.  Keep up the good work.
[comment]2012.  I remember driving through Ohio and there was an overpass that had the American flag and a big sign that said “Honk if you love America”. I yanked that air horn like a true patriot. 

The next overpass had the same giant flag. I couldn’t read the sign but I hammered down the horn anyway. 

As I passed it said “Honk if you hate Obama” and I remember seriously wishing I could take that honk back.
[comment]Yeah that's just what his sycophant cabal tells him
[comment]Lying is the GOP's shibboleth.  They declare who they are in ritual violence to the truth.

Bit of advice though: Never call yourself a "proud" anything - it's defensive, and concedes ground that rightfully belongs to you.

Let Republicans call themselves "proud."  They have to, because they have nothing to be proud of.
[comment]Truckers keep the country open!
[comment]Thank you for the hard work you do! Without you and other truck drivers, my store would be empty and I would have nothing to do at my job!
[comment]Thank you for working hard to keep all of our shelves stocked! You’re keeping our country going in a time of real need!
[comment]It’s refreshing to see a blue-collar worker who isn’t completely braindead in regards to politics.

By the way, I say this not as an insult. I am active duty military, my father is a railroad man, and his father before him was a plumber. I’m not saying that blue-collar workers are stupid; simply that the majority of us are uneducated and/or fooled when it comes to matters directly related to politics and critical thinking.

All working people should support progressive causes and workers rights!
[comment]When I watched the news and they explained what the noise was in the background being truckers and they cut to the orange douchebag and he said that it was truckers in support of him, when in all actuality the truckers were there protesting against the fucking idiot, I mean this POS thinks every freaking thing is about him I really don't understand how the hell anybody ever voted for this piece of shit and I damn sure don't understand how the hell anybody could vote for him in the next election. But there's not going to be enough of them voting for him they have seen him and they are tired of him and what he has done to our country and to all Americans, Donald j drumpf has American blood on his hands and he cannot be forgiven for what he has done and they and we have had enough, they meaning Republicans who voted for him and whatever dumbass Democrats and independents voted for him. Democrats we all need to get out and vote this election and I know it sounds cliche but this election is going to be the most important election that you will ever vote in, we Democrats ask all Republicans and Independents that are sick and tired of this demonic entity, wannabe dictator to come join us on November 3rd and vote this POS out of office and send him and his three little piglets (kids) back to hell where they came from. Donald j drumpf is a fucking demonic entity who needs to be voted out in November along with his dictatorial administration. And let the investigations begin Mr pompeo (by the way he kisses his dear leaders ass it should be mrs. Pompeo), mr. Perdue you classless billionaire dirty dealing bum, mr. Turtle Man McConnell, Lindsay bitch-ass Graham, Rand can't afford a good toupee Paul and last but damn sure not least mrs. Betsy DeVos you POS for what you have done and what you continue to do to our education system and all the poor and middle-class kids all of you will be investigated and it's almost a guarantee that some of you will be tried and convicted for something you have done while in office against our country and our people, dirty deals can only go on for so long. And Joe Biden said he would not pardon anyone, including the wannabe dictator, demonic entity Donald j drumpf!!
[comment]Me too, brother.
[comment]I wonder if that's what his handlers told him and he childishly believed it.  

And THANK YOU for speaking out!!!

[comment]Im a paramedic. I despise Trump.
[comment]Deliver my crap and shut up.  More government equals more proplems
[comment]They're not.  90+% of white truck drivers support Trump (or at least supported him until the last month or two).  The primary reason is race, most white working class white men are hardcore racists.  Now some of the older ones may actually be moving to Biden, but that is because of Trump's incompetence on the pandemic, not because they have softened on white supremacy.
[comment]Found a pack of toilet paper today! Thank you Mr. Trucker!
[comment]truckers are the backbone of america its a shame they dont get treated fairly
[comment]Thank you 🙏 for keeping us alive
[comment]as Hank Hill said, truckers are the last of the cowboys
[comment]Rock on.
[comment]The country finally realized that truckers, grocery workers, meatpacking workers, and many more are essential.  Even though the industry has been treating you guys like shit.  Thank you for your service and thank you for your understanding that **CheetoAssolini** could give a flying fuck for people like us and not support him.
[comment]Down is up in covefe land, and down is the new normal for trumbo, going down in November... VOTE ! 😆
[comment]I'm a semi driver too and just got back from a long week away from home driving down to Alabama and Georgia and Tennessee and up to Michigan and Ohio and a lot of places in between. Many things sicken me about Trump but the most glaring bit of nausea right now is that he has absolutely no concern whether 50,000 or 250,000 or 300,000 people die from the virus. He views it all from the lens of whether it benefits him or is not a benefit to him. I really don't even know if you can still call him a human being.
[comment]Just simplify: "As always, Trump lies about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ."
[comment]Thank you for what you do!! My dad and stepdad both drive trucks. I worry about them all the time. People drive like idiots around truckers, completely ignorant. The whole industry needs more respect, this country doesn't function without you all
[comment]I don’t work.  To much government sucks. Think how they run va hospitals and dmv. Not enough means big business rights the rules. Bank bailouts to big to fail BS. We have to have affordable health insurance and real paying jobs. Get our country back from China. I own rent houses in Chicago because the government pays the most of any city.

[comment]To my knowledge michigan is red in regards to the house of representatives and red in the senate. Those votes are the only one that matter. Popular vote does not win you the presidential election. If you want your states electoral college to align with the majority of the people presidential candidate, you must first win back your states house of representatives and senate.

<|startoftext|>[title]Hillary Clinton: With their votes to make the American president accountable to no one, Republican senators have put the interests of one president over the interests of all Americans. The only remedy now is for us all to vote in overwhelming numbers to replace them—and him—in November.
[selftext]https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1223378977219280897?s=09[comment]Preach.
[comment]We need to put so much pressure on them. Protests leading to the election. We cannot forget how this wannabe authoritarian has put party over us, the American people.

I know people are going to be angry and want to do stuff. As much as we’d love to see a more physical reaction, doing so would not work in our favor. The more pressure we keep on them, the more people will remember what this criminal did.

Personally, I’d love to see him get removed by the military (the whole oath. I’m not talking about violence), and I think the GOP should be completely dissolved. They are traitors to this country, and our founding fathers and countless vets who have their lives fighting against POS leaders in wars are turning in their graves.
[comment]This assumption just continues to push down the road the inevitable riots that will be necessary to get our democracy back.  Does that sound overly dramatic?  Alarmist?  

Good.  Because everyone sitting back being depressed or mildly angry about the impeachment trial, don't seem to understand what happens next.  The day after Trump got free of the Mueller investigation, he made the call to Zelensky that got him impeached.  The day after.  What do you think he'll do the day after he's acquitted for that act?  Because that's this coming Monday.  

He's being acquitted on the argument that anything a president does to get re-elected *is* in the public interest and legal.  That's the closing argument his lawyer made.  

That means having Barr open investigations into the top dem candidates is fine.  It means fining or starting investigations into news channels or reporters is fine.  It means suspending November's election because they found widespread "election tampering" is fine.  All of them are fine and legal if it helps him get re-elected.  Who's going to stop any of it?  Trump's Justice Dept?  Washington Republicans?  Maybe the Supreme Court?  The one headed by the Chief Justice that just silently presided over the sham trial?

These are easily within the realm of possibility.  And probably many more things we haven't thought of.  It's going to get bad, then it's going to get worse.  Trump will do whatever hd has to to get re-elected because it's the only way he avoids very bad consequences in the SDNY.  And now the Senate, and the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS, have just given him a free pass to do all of it.
[comment]We know.. but I wish Hillary would lay low..
[comment]Go leee..... Who gives an F about what she has to say.
[comment]@jennifercohn (twitter) has demonstrated for 3 years how election machines are vote flipping. 17,000,000 people removed from the electoral roll - 8% of voters in 2016. Minority discrimination. Parscale's Cambridge Analytica/Facebook/Russia perverting voters scheme MkII - he said is now an order of magnitude larger than 4 years ago. Gerrymander is still outcome determining.

I bring this up time after time to point out the Democrats are anywhere between 8 ~ 18% (guestimate) behind the GOP with the aforesaid cheating, theft of votes before the election starts. Unless you deal with this the GOP will win. Get onto MSM and pester them until MSM calls this outrageous and demands change. Because as you have just seen in the Senate anything less is just the GOP telling you to piss off and cry harder net time round.
[comment]Optimistic of her to assume the GOP is going to allow elections in November.   


I think that's highly unlikely now.
[comment]Wait, isn’t she the former Democratic Presidential candidate who wouldn’t commit to backing the Democratic nominee, regardless of who it was?
[comment]And if we can’t?  If they steal another election?  Are we lost then?  Because this feels like we’re maybe lost as a nation.
[comment]They just got a full-fledged, free-pass to cheat elections in any way they see fit. There is absolutely NO hope for democracy to fix this. It is violence/civil war, or dictatorship. I get the feeling it will be both.
[comment]We won’t stop there. This Russian-backed movement movement, predicated on fear and ignorance, has helped foment a counter-movement made of informed voters, waiting far too long to be heard.

We’re going after white nationalists, xenophobes, neoliberals, and everyone that represents ignorance and corruption. We’re voting them all out, and it’s a long time coming.
[comment]The Democrat controlled Senate also voted for no new witnesses in the Clinton impeachment.

How soon we forget?
[comment]And vote for Bernie, who you fucked over.
[comment]I've read several of the posts in this sub and I absolutely agree with them, but I ask 1 thing from all of you who say they will get out there and vote and will drive people to the polls to vote, please stop saying and don't say that it won't matter because it will and anything and everything anyone can do to get out there and vote and get others to vote with them (to vote Democrat that is) is what we need but one thing I'm sick and tired of reading and hearing is that we as Democrats have to win big just have to beat him big at the poles and to me that's a bunch of bulshit since when do the Democrats or Republicans have to win big the reason people are saying this is because they are assuming that if a Democrat no I mean when a Democrat wins the presidency in 2020 if it's close the wannabe dictator will say it's a sham election, let the wannabe dictator say all he wants because in 2020 when he loses and January 20th 2021 comes around he loses all power and that's from the Constitution and yes I understand how many of us have no faith in the Constitution anymore because of what happened with the impeachment but keep your heads up and please get out their and vote in November and any Democrat that reads thisyou need to vote for the Democrat that is the nominee no matter who it is, no matter if you agree or disagree with this person we have to stick together to get this wannabe dictator and his dictatorial administration out of office that's the only way it will be done!!
[comment]To the poster PD Genoa keep it going my friend I'm enjoying everything you've posted when you're right, you're right sir, and I know it probably hurts to keep having to school these right wing cult followers but maybe just maybe you'll break through one of their thick skulls and then they'll see the light and how much of a con man their dear leader really is!!
[comment]When Democrats refused to go after Bush for Iraq all moral high ground was lost. They are just as much as a party to this moral slippage as Republicans.
[comment]Trump 2020
[comment]She isn’t relevant anymore
[comment]Hillary just needs to fade away at this point. Enough with the establishment politicians, obviously people cant stand them right now which is entirely the reason Trump got elected.
[comment]ITT: Y'all need to fucking stop with this "they'll cancel the election" fatalist shit.

They have only even breathed going anywhere within a lightyear's radius of there *once* since Trump got elected, and the public outrage was so intense that y'all probably don't even remember that he seriously suggested abolishing term limits, because he and everyone around him had the two brain cells to rub together and realize that was a highly efficient way to get guillotines installed on the White House lawn, and have not even breathed it since.

The election will happen, and we will fight tooth and nail to see this cadre of Vichy Republicans ousted.
[comment]is Hillary saying that there is hope?   i feel so depressed about this..
[comment]I'd vote for her, just to make sure there can be some good in this world. But in no way is she the only option.
[comment]Just better hope your not 1 of the millions of Americans that got knocked off the Voter rolls
[comment]When Sanders wins the nomination I hope she maintains enthusiasm to defeat Republicans.
[comment]The extent to which the GOP has shat all over democracy cannot be overstated.  HRC can promote the vote, I don't understand why there isn't a new Occupy DC movement scheduled to start on Monday.  If I were the sheriff in town, I'd hang every GOP that voted to be complicit in Trump's crimes.
[comment]I agree with this sentiment, but not from *that woman*. -- a whole bunch of assholes who didn't vote for her in 2016
[comment]But make sure to bash Bernie and create discord among the Democrats so trump can get selected by the electoral college again.
[comment]Dems were weak. That is why you lost. You didn't try to impeach for the American people. You try to gain brownie points. Well, screw you.<|endoftext|>

[comment]&gt;That statewide political operation was unparalleled in Texas, and even the nation.

That's what I keep trying to tell Bernie Sander's supporters. Real political power comes from organizing people on the ground, not clicking buttons on your phone. It also means showing up for other Democrats, which they also don't seem to get.
[comment]Sorry as a liberal gun owner I can honestly say Robert Francis O'Rourke can go suck a donkey dick.  He won't run because he knows he's damaged goods at this point and won't be able to get elected to the office of dog catcher in Texas.

[comment]Good on him for doing what's best for the country even after his personal ambitions didn't pan out. I hope all of the remaining candidates follow his example.

His dropping out is not a failure. He is a shining light,a true American. I'm  hoping that my grandkids vote for  someone like  Beto O'Rourke.

[comment]I gave an upvote for I agree completely, to be honest, I believe the GOP is dead.
[comment]Both parties need to be completely disbanded and we need to serious rethink the way we approach campaign finance. Our political structure with it's checks and balances was well thought by the founding fathers but it did not take into account the two party system that came shortly after the ratification of the constitution.

Disclaimer: I am fiscally conservative, socially liberal.
[comment]They're Republicans for a reason. Why would that be good in the first place. They're either too stupid to realize that they're voting against their own self interest or they know what the Republican party is really about.  It was never about morality, smaller government, less taxes or strong national defense.  It has always about making the rich get richer at the been expense of everything that is Democratic and fair. There's no such a thing as a good Republican.
[comment]You are so right, they are not good...they're fucking AWESOME!  I find it so amusing how the Republicans "True Party for the People" cut you down and how hurt you are.  What a pathetic group of people.
[comment]This was supposed to happen in 2016. It did not.
[comment]Good GOP do exist - they’re just not involved.  My brother in-law was asked to be the state director for the 2016 Trump campaign, and he turned it down.  Any other presidential candidate and he would have been absolutely thrilled to do it.  I disagree with my bro in-law a shit ton, but I was genuinely proud of him for turning down that job.
[comment]can they suffer devastating losses? they are gerrymandered to ensure reelection
[comment]In other words, the entire Republican party needs to go.
[comment]Why wouldn't the Republicans continue on this same path, since the voters have yet to punish them for their actions, starting with shutting down the government during Obama and everything since then?
[comment]This is superbly true but similar culling needs to happen on our own side of the aisle.
[comment]She's a snitch. lol
[comment]I agree with this completely.  I think the obsession many Republicans have with Nikki Haley is more because there are so few prominent Republican women than anything else.
[comment]Remember this date - November 3, 2020 - It’s the date 35 Senate seats, all 435 House seats, and 11 Governorship’s are up for re-election. Plus at least 1 Supreme Court seat is at stake.

[comment]I don't know about all of you but I'm looking at this photo and thinking to myself WTF this country would have been like and should have been if she were to have won, BTW she did win!! She won the people's vote and that's the most important thing, so please everyone out there that reads this get everyone you know to either mail in a voting ballot or get everyone you know out to vote on November 3rd and have them all vote for Joe Biden as well as for every Democrat on the ballot. To all my liberal friends that have doubts just remember this with Joe Biden you will get something you want passed but with this wannabe dictator in the White House you will get what you have been getting and that is NOTHING!! WE NEED ALL LIBERALS TO COME TOGETHER WITH DEMOCRATS TO DEFEAT THIS POS. WE WILL HAVE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS JOINING US TO VOTE THIS WANNABE DICTATOR OUT OF OFFICE ON NOVEMBER 3RD. Just remember what THE LAST REAL PRESIDENT THAT WE HAD ALWAYS SAID AND CONTINUES TO SAY: VOTE!!

[selftext]https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-09/health-insurance-reduces-death-rates?_amp=true[comment]More people having health insurance reduces deaths. No way, who would have thought.
[comment]Yeah but Republican sheep won't believe this but shout it is fake news
[comment]Someone had to study that?
[comment]Yup total idiots 😡
[comment]Kinda sad we needed a study to tell us that.
[comment]Now lets see what happens when you get rid of deductibles. For all of the ACAs strengths, it never really removed the problem of figuring out how you're going to come up with 1,000 cash for that colonoscopy. Waiting until November on the hope that you've hit your yearly OOP is not good enough.
[comment]No, you don't say?
[comment]r/Expected
[comment]That's a real shocker
[comment]What an incredible finding. /s
[comment]In other news, water is wet.
[comment]So ask yourself, does the Republican Party want poor people to live longer and collect the social security they paid into their entire lives?
[comment]And all those people who voted for Trump and Republicans on one issue - abortion - are killing people by voting for them.
[comment]shocking.  

I wonder how many more people could have had health care for the cost of this study.
[comment]..... and this headline shows why Medicare For All is the best route forward.

Because going from “health insurance” to “health care” will reduce the number of deaths even further.

Senator Warren means well with her plan, but I am going for the OG who brought Medicare for All to the public’s mind, and who is going to go full-throttle with it, Senator Bernie Sanders.
[comment]You mean we're pro-life after all? Who'd have thought!
[comment]OBAMACARE IS TRASH AND A LIE A MANIPULATED TO MAKE YOU THINK ITS GOOD, OBAMA DONT "CARE" AND HAD RUINED HEALTHCARE
[comment]The logical fallacy here is the unproven assumption that Obamacare would somehow magically result in more people having health insurance that would magically be of the same quality than the health care that extended people's lives in this study.

(SPOILER FROM EUROPE: it won't.)
[comment]Duh
[comment]But opposers to the Obamacare don't care about death rates :/
[comment]Healthcare, that thing that cares for your health, reduces death rates? Whoa never saw that coming.
[comment]Having health insurance reduces death rate?

Yeah, okay.

Next you'll be telling me that water is wet.
[comment]And water is wet :/
[comment]No shit ? Lol
[comment]What is wrong with this country that this needs to be "proved".
[comment]I wonder if the study is at all adjusted for the people that ended up with outrageous deductibles after Obamacare.

My Dad died 100% because we had to get rid of our previously great healthcare once the ACA passed. We were lower middle class and therefore went from havimg negligible deductibles to having a 5000$ one. He needed to stay in the hospital for observation but decided he couldnt afford the deductible. Went home and died. A complication between his insulin and the powerful antibiotics he was on. 

The ACA insured the abject poor at the coat of the lower middle class. Not sure if the end result is a net positive.
[comment]"Obamacare study proves that robbing someone gives you more money"
[comment]Say what you will about Clinton, she may have been our best chance at crafting lasting healthcare reform in this term.

Universal healthcare became *her* project ,I think, in President Clinton's first term.
[comment]Impossible! Next you’ll be telling me that seatbelts reduce the number deaths in car accidents!
[comment]Who did this study? Why? Go away anyone who thought you'd be less likely to die if you can't afford healthcare. Like literally, this shouldn't even make he news because we should all understand it to be true.
[comment]Imagine how much lower the rate will be when Medicare for All is passed and the everyone has full coverage.
[comment]Every 60 seconds a minute passes in Africa
[comment]Oh shit. So going to the dr more often because you can afford it lowers death rates? Damn that’s some shit. Stupid ass republicans.
[comment]Oh who would have guessed people having health care leads to people them not dying early...?

[selftext]https://www.mazechmedia.com/2020/04/house-democrats-propose-2000-a-month-payment-to-americans-until-economy-recovers-from-coronavirus/[comment]Republicans won’t let this happen
[comment]Whatever stimulus/assistance/whatever needs to be adjusted the local cost of living. $2,000 a month in most of the country is not bad, but in the Bay Area $2,000 a month means you’re living in your car.
[comment]This better not have a fucking income limit like the last one. High income doesn't exclude you from being unemployed and needing stimulus money.
[comment]and then quickly retreated to their back up position, having every American pay the government 2,0000 a month for "protection"

The traitors then said 2,000 a month to protect us from themselves was too little
[comment]Why not $3,000?
[comment]Maybe it's a nightmare to administer, but how about the check being 30% of local area median income?
[comment]I hope this happens.
[comment]Hey Dems.

You guys need to FRAME this correctly.

**"We are providing this bill so consumers can not only pay their current bills but also so they be more than ready to support their local shops, retail stores and restaurants when the lockdown is over!"**

FRAME IT CORRECTLY.
[comment]Health insurance would be great too. How many people can actually afford COBRA payments on top of everything else when they have been laid off? With 22 million people on unemployment after just three weeks, it's insane how many people probably lost their health insurance as well. Fat Joffrey killed people with his lack of response to this crisis.

[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/09/politics/obama-trump-coronavirus-response-flynn-case/index.html[comment]Shocking that a failure in life is a failure in the White House.  If only we'd been warned that Trump was a walking disaster.
[comment]Hillary was correct...back in 2015 she warned us.
[comment]...and that's putting it mildly!
[comment]There isn't a day that goes by where I don't miss having a real leader.
[comment]Everyday I feel threatened by Trump’s insane tweets. His polarization and rhetoric is destroying this country, widening the divide. If a real leader were in the White House, our relationship with China would have been handled and we would have tackled it there, it would not have taken a foothold here. 

I feel like we would have helped them with it in Oct/Nov and it never would have hurt so many people globally. 

This goes to show how important it is to have a mature, diplomatic, strategic leader —who values science and expert opinion. Sorry rant over.
[comment]Has Trump responded to this yet?
[comment]Damn Obama, should have done medicare for all in 2009 but the donors didn't want it.
[comment]Obama wouldn't have handled it much better. Not a single politician we've seen has known how to manage this without getting royally fucked in the end. Because you can't contain something as chaotic as this.

Besides, wasn't Obama's vice president saying this shit wasn't a big deal before it went full pandemic?
[comment]The real story here is that he took a break from windsurfing with Richard Branson.
[comment]Wow!? Really!? Thanks for really making an impact. No sh*t.
[comment]Not only is Trump simply not smart enough to understand the science behind the pandemic, making him an extremely poor choice to make the necessary decisions to combat it, but he cares far more about how the pandemic reflects on him and his reelection bid than actually saving lives. He still doesn't seem to have learned that this not a political problem that he can lie his way out of. History will not be kind to him and if our country reelects him, it won't be kind to any of us.
[comment]‘absolute chaotic disaster’ is an understatement
[comment]Thank you, Captain Obvious!
[comment]IThere is only one person to blame for all of COVID-19, and its Trump. He had the warnings. He ignored them like the captain of the Titanic with the Iceberg warnings. He got rid of the Pandemic office. He failed to protect Pangolins in the Illegal wildlife trade. He is encouraging protests who are organized by gun toting White supremacists. Yeah that's not dangerous. 🙄
[comment]Thankyou Obama for forcing us to pay for unaffordable healthcare
[comment]Guy states obvious, most Americans seem to shrug their soldiers and go get a haircut. I'll stay at home and skip this particular beta program, thank you very much.
[comment]Blah blah blah.
[comment]We know 🙄
[comment]Louder please, Obama.
[comment]That’s being too kind.
[comment]He won last time because Democrats didn't unite their base and put all their eggs in the center-right liberal and moderate Republican basket. But this time the same strategy will work because Trump is bad.
[comment]I don’t understand why on earth the GOP insists on killing off their voting bloc. The folks who tend to vote for them fall into at least one high-risk category. The approval rating for Trump has plummeted in the wake of the pandemic, so if they expect to win the election (I hope they don’t win) why kill off the people who tend to have the highest turn-out for your party?

Is there something I’m missing here?
[comment]I guess it's Obama's job to say 100% uncontroversial remarks these days.
[comment]** What we're fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy -- that has become a stronger impulse in American life.**

That very succinctly sums up everything I despise about Donald Trump and today’s GOP.
[comment]Anything the democrat party has ever gotten involved with turns out to be a disaster. Yet somehow it’s always Trump’s fault.<|endoftext|>

[comment]This is a great way to frame it, and I'm glad he's doing that.  But more Dems than just Schiff need to be saying this.  Every day.  On every channel.  Loudly.

Dems, when they occasionally hit on good messaging, flub it by not following through and hammering it.
[comment]Republicans are turning our democracy into a dictatorship. Anyone but a Republican 2020!
[comment]This is the GOP (Grand Obstructionist Party) in action.  Do whatever is good for me and screw America.  Vote in 2020 to correct.
[comment]You lost me at CNN #standwithBernie
[comment]At what point will Democrats learn the GOP will not be guilted into doing the right thing.  The GOP will do every little nasty &amp; terrible thing to win.  Stop pretending to be shocked.
[comment]No they are not..sorry pencil neck
[comment]Like the witnesses were allowed in the House farce?
[comment]Its amazing how prepared, eloquent, and factual the managers are, contrasted by Trumps people just banging the table with no prepared remarks.
[comment]And just so we're clear, they have no problem working with the president to obstruct the truth.
[comment]I am SO OVER the GOP...JUST SO OVER Them...
[comment]These people are literally, knowingly and publicly obstructing justice and it’s just old and sad now. Like them.
[comment]Schiff is correct.

The incumbent RepubliKKKons are a vile bunch indeed.
They need to hear it at the ballot box loud and clear.

VOTE BLUE NO MATTER WHO!!!

I know I will.

I've voted for Republicans plenty of times.

Never again.

Ever.
[comment]Hang them all from the highest rafter. They deserve no less.
[comment]Instead of trying to make it a moral issue (the senators are all comfortable with their ethical code...I don’t think they need a lecture from this guy) why doesn’t he focus on his findings in the house investigation as they relate to the two articles?
[comment]They are getting equal time to talk. Apparently that was what was considered fair in the house so why do you have a problem now that it’s the saMe way in the senate? 

Maybe they can discuss a minority day for witnesses after the trial is done? That would only be fair. 

The minority shouldn’t expect to have it go their way because they are the minority and that’s how it goes. They need to have a convincing enough case to get support for their theories. Living in an echo chamber makes it difficult when you try to reach other people.
[comment]Don’t you think the blowback for not allowing witnesses or new evidence being admitted will cost them their seats?  Last I read it’s about 70% of Americans want witnesses?  People will not forget this.  Especially the middle.
[comment]It wasn’t about truth in the house. It was all a one sided echo chamber for the democrats. There was bi partisan support against impeachment. If the process was treated fairly from the beginning it may be different, but now it’s the Republicans turn and the democrats didn’t care to get their support. They just rammed impeachment through because they had the votes.
[comment]I thought we already had all the evidence we needed lol
[comment]Schiff: If I had done my job, we wouldn’t have to be begging the Senate to do it for us.

(Thinking in his head: We literally can’t go tits up since not naming a crime means no evidence required!)
[comment]Just like how the house picked their witnesses ?
[comment]I’m guessing the trial. Don’t you think there will be some losses for this sham?  The perception of hiding and covering up facts and witnesses?  Curious what you think?
[comment]I guess that’s why you aren’t releasing the Intel IG testimony and blocking the “whistle blower” Eric ciaramella because, Adam Pedo schiff worked with him to setup this scam.. If the pedocrats wanted Bolton they should have taken him to court.. Trump2020 Trump4eva
[comment]We should have picked a better messenger. Adam Schiff discredited himself during the three years of Russia gate by constantly lying about proofs he did not have and now everything he says is taken by the independents as political hack job. The message is ok, but the messenger is really just the worst possible pick.<|endoftext|>

[comment]Why couch it with "in modern American history"?
[comment]Agree
[comment]Just modern? I can't think of any that comes close. Prior to Trump my bottom five was Jackson, A Johnson, Buchanan, Harding and Nixon. Trump is worse than all of them combined.
[comment]Thanks Joe, it’s about time you caught up to the other candidates
[comment]I disagree... with the use of his word "modern".
[comment]And we don't know everything about what he's been doing. We probably don't have anywhere near half the story yet.

Only criminal I can think of who is compatible would be Trump's idol Vladimir Putin. It's probably true that he's the richest man in the world.

Way I see it this was the reason why Trump wanted to be in politics in the first place. He's known for years about Vladimir's fabulous hidden wealth. He's been laundering his dirty money for decades. He wanted to do the same thing Vladimir did but BIGGER. 

If Vladimir made an enormous amount of money in Russia, Trump should be able to make even more money in America.

Trump logic...

It sounds really bad, I know, but I want his supporters to see the results of his bullshit. It seems like that's the only way to get across to them, at this point.
[comment]And then Trump goes on to say that he did this to "stop a war". Yes, you heard it...TO ... STOP ... A ...WAR! It would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous. Trump eerily and terrifyingly sounds like the Ministry of Truth in the book 1984 when they meme that "WAR IS PEACE" to their manipulated working class population.

He specializes in White-collar crime and federal and state government investigations. Luskin is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at the Georgetown University Law Center, where he teaches a course in Global Anti-Corruption. Formerly, Luskin taught Advanced Criminal Law and Labor Racketeering at the University of Virginia School of Law." wiki
[comment]Was he already subpoenaed or not? I’m seeing reports that he’d agreed to appear voluntarily. If that’s the case, then Dems should subpoena him now and hold him accountable if he refuses to comply?
[comment]Is he for real?
[comment]Throw Pompeo in jail for inherent contempt until he rescinds this order.  Democrats must exercise what powers they have before they have none.
[comment]3/10 Americans: he's just fighting the deep state this is totally normal.

We need serious reform after this is all over.
[comment]Lol. Jesus. How blatantly obvious can you be? This is just as, if not more, damning than just letting the diplomat testify.
[comment]WWIPD

What Would an Innocent Person Do?
[comment]Not even trying to hide obstruction of justice anymore.
[comment]They legally can't interfere with his telling what he knows. Their interfering constitutes a criminal act in and of itselfbecause everyone has the right to know what really happened and to get the testimony of all who were involved. They can just add more criminal charges like felony obstruction of justice, interfering with a material witness, Lying to law enforcement tge FBI etc and any more charges thwy want to include because these are criminal acts and prosecutable sitting president or not and it is far worse than Nixon, or Bill Clinton ever did.
[comment]Until he pays for obstruction why would he stop?
[comment]It's what authoritarian governments do.
[comment]So it's treason then.
[comment]Get real White House!!!  It's never the crime, but always the cover-up!!!
[comment]Look! More Obstruction!
[comment]What would happen if he, i dunno, testified anyway?
[comment]Subpoena his ass and hold in contempt of congress if he refuses! Come on folks
[comment]Demonstrating that he has no understanding or respect for the Constitutional roles in checks and balances. He's a pirate who does not deserve to lead our country. On Election Day, out he must go...if not sooner.
[comment]Nancy...take the vote!
[comment]Because nothing says "innocent" than not allowing hearings to happen...
[comment]Contempt and imprisonment. Now
[comment]Goes to the mattresses
[comment]That's called obstruction of justice. I guess we'll throw it on the pile
[comment]He’s going for dictatorship!
[comment]“Orders” lol

<|startoftext|>[title]Stephen Miller is no outlier. White supremacy rules the Republican party
[selftext]https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/stephen-miller-white-supremacy-republican-party[comment]Some are just better at hiding it than others but it's prevalent.
[comment]98% of people at that level of politics are differing degrees of evil.  On both sides of the isle.
[comment]IMHO, the problem is that while there are certainly racists in the party, many aren't.  Those who aren't get offended at the accusation. But that those who aren't are just fine with being with or among racists.  Anything that furthers the cause is acceptable. To us that just isn't good enough.   

Which leads to "good people on both sides"  thinking.
[comment]I don't hear anyone significant on the Republican side asking him to resign. That speaks VOLUMES.
[comment]Dudes! White supremacy is why all the people who are in the Republican Party moved to the Republican party. After the Civil Rights Act was passed by Democrats ALL the racists moved to the Republican party, and all the non-racists moved to the Democratic party. It's something we all know, but sometimes need to be reminded of.
[comment]It is precisely why 80-90% of Republicans voted for and still support Trump. This WWC economic angst is a euphemism for racism. Racists by any other name are still racists! And this truth makes you uncomfortable to fucking bad! I will scream it to my brain. But, don't think it's just White Republicans...many in Democratic party push this same shit only less overt! But both party are deeply aligned with White Supremacy or they wouldn't be lyong about a president can't be indicted no matter what crimes he commits. The Constitution says no such thing. A group of white men got together in the 70s when Nixon was caught up in Watergate burglary wrote a memo contradicting the Constitution. But, be clear, if Barack Obama even hinted at breaking the laws they would have indicted him quick fast and in a hurry.
[comment]by now with everything that Trump has done or said if they are still Trumpers they are racist.  even if they claim not to be " my grandchildren are biracial " or the now famous "I have black friends " that is just something that helps them deny their true racist beliefs. and this extends to his administration and the GOP.
[comment]This started in the Nixon years... the ["southern strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy). It has only gotten worse. For Republicans to deny the inherent racism in their entire world-view is simply ridiculous.
[comment]And in other news, water is wet.
[comment]Trump is the blowback we got for electing Barack Obama, along with the secondary opportunistic infections led by the Koch brother style politics, and the Russian invasion.  

We should have been educated about it and been ready to fight back and instead we still aren't talking about it.
[comment]Miller plays to an audience of one: Donald Trump.   He's the prisoner in a concentration camp who lickspittles to the guards to avoid his own death.

His own family finds him distasteful.  That says it all.
[comment]Deciding you're okay with white supremacy is the same as being a white supremacist.
[comment]There was a Frontline episode a few weeks ago about how this trio: Jeff Sessions, Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller realized they could use the Immigration issue to win. They were behind the primary where Dave Brat ousted Eric Cantor, which killed Immigration Reform back in 2013.
[comment]It is and it needs to be reminded that it has no place in civilized society.
[comment]White supremacists are in the Republican party, but the Republican party is not white supremacist.

I'm voting Democrat in the next primary because I want Trump and his utter dumpster fire of an administration out of office, but the Left doesn't do itself any favors when they spew hyperbolic nonsense like we see with intersectionality and other progressive talking points.

If you want to win and to push out Trump and his cheerleaders in Congress, you need to be more appealing to the moderate vote and not go further left. The right is going further right, don't reciprocate.
[comment]Lol the party that created the KKK talking about white supremacy!
[comment]Those that enable racists remind me of boomer Chad's trying to impress their dad.
[comment]I sure as hell know this. A hommie of mine worked for pence in college and this guy was so afraid of black people.  He'd also say terriable thing about then.  Lmao he passed the bar and got into political law.  He expects to become a politician. Hes in Narnia land with his ideas on how to fix the country.
[comment]The whole damn party needs.to go.

 Burn it to the ground
[comment]I mean, if they don't get rid of him after that email dump, it's... kinda telling?

[comment]Good
[comment]GOP is a bunch of cowards. They admit he was guilty but don’t have any balls to go against their party. Poor excuse for “Americans” supporting a draft dodger.
[comment]This is why we need Bernie Sanders. He is the only one that could give a proper counter attack to Trump. Pete is too obama. And Biden is only one full step away from being as loose as a cannon as Donald trump. Joker. Bernie hasn’t given an F about sound “right”. He says what he is convicted about.
[comment]From this day on,there will be pressure on any senate that has a majority the same as the president to acquit. No matter the charge or the evidence. 

Hell of a precedent.
[comment]Fucking ridiculous bullshit from these fucking fuckers....

These people(and those that are saying “hell yeah!”) are seditionist bastards who care more about their own twisted ideology than the laws our country was founded upon.
[comment]Haha sucks for you. Time for Pelosi to resign.
[comment]Well in my opinion they impeached him for the most stupidest reason. WHAT THEY SHOULVE WENT FOR was bribery from Saudi Arabia during the election
[comment]Get the fucker out of here along with his cronies
[comment]Winning the electoral college is paramount. Liberals in blue areas need to identify swing states and move your vote there. For example, I am originally from CA and spend much of my time there, but AZ is a senate and presidential toss up state. Please move your vote to a swing state with close poll numbers, it's not hard to do and you don't need to have full time residency. Anything less than flooding swing states with blue votes is totally pointless. PLEASE SHARE THIS.
[comment]I am a salt collector and today you are overworking me.
[comment]All Democrats managed to do is cause his poll numbers to go up. I don’t think this is going to backfire on him. People vote for winners not losers and we all lost.

[comment]Off to FOX he goes
[comment]We had to concede the seat, that is the sacrifice to get rid of this POS instantly.

We could have taken the seat, but it’s all good to see him go.
[comment]This is foreshadowing November
[comment]I have never thought--ever, not *once*\--about any proposed liberal policy, or victorious Democratic candidate, or any legislative success for progressives, "This will really own the cons" and yet, upon reading that this symbol of everything the right cherishes and pushes lost his fucking seat, I just involuntarily thought, "*Good*, this will bum out the alt right."

So I guess I've finally become that sort of partisan. Not sure how I feel about it. Anyone else have similar feelings/misgivings?
[comment]Cue Nelson
[comment]Couldn’t have happened to a nicer sack-of-shit.
[comment]Only to be replaced by a more radical right-wing supremacist. Honestly what’s here to celebrate?
[comment]Okay, watch where this guy goes.  What industry picks him up as a lobbyist, or as a pundit, or lands him a cushy job in an executive suite.  Watch where this little king, who is so racist the Republicans don't want him in public, watch where he goes. And that will tell you everything you need to know about Republicans.
[comment]Good riddance.
[comment]Bye bye you piece of shit
[comment]It's good to see that asshole fail, but the guy who replaces him won't be any better. He'll just be smart enough to know not to say the quiet part out loud.
[comment]His Republican opponent isn't much better. As far right as you can get without actually being Steve King.
[comment]Oh this is great news. This fuckstick anti American needs to be retired and then investigated for his corruption and hate speech
[comment]I look forward to attending his political funeral and pouring one out on the grave. Gonna need to filter it through my kidneys first.
[comment]Remember Joni Ernst had no problem with him.  And He was parading around with Trump in 2016.  Good work NW Iowa.  Lot of work left.
[comment]# HAAAAA! 

...good...
[comment]Got rid of the worst "Democratic" representative (Lipinski) and the worst GOP representative (King) in the primaries this year!
[comment]If only the world would stay improved...
[comment]This is barely a victory. King was largely defeated by an opponent who accused him of net being loyal/committed enough to Trump. That's what resonated with Republican voters. I don't think they care about his racism.
[comment]Womp Womp.
[comment]Yet " Feenstra as a true conservative who could do more to help President Trump in Washington.  "  says it all. They may have put forward a  worse candidate. 

Good god Iowans. Elect democrats!
[comment]I read the headline as “racially diverse” lol I was like whah?
[comment]The shape of things to come...
[comment]I guess there is a line even republicans won’t cross these days. I’m sure they think his biggest crime is saying the quiet part out loud.
[comment]Love to see it!

[comment]I’m not too informed on Steve king I’ve heard people on podcasts say that he’s a racist but why? What has he done to earn the title from so many people?
[comment]And another snake head even more wicked will grow in it's place.
[comment]I read that he lost, not because of his racism, but because his challenger made the case that he wasn’t loyal enough to trump. If there was ever any doubt that it’s a cult.
[comment]Anybody know who the new most racist member of Congress is?

[comment]Im not feeling Tulsi. I think most of us are feeling Tulsi. You know who else im not feeling. Hilllary Clinton. This type of shnizz nozz ain't helpful.

Sure... The right will latch on in bad faith and she might get a bump from some bots here and there. But you know whats more likely. That Tulsi Gabbard just sucks. Butt out Mrs Clinton.  For the next 18 months please. Just butt out.
[comment]Big fax
[comment]Tulsi calling out the bullshit and the media conglomerates. Do not be fooled by the media giants.
[comment]I pretty much believe everything she says at this point
[comment]From the ads I've seen online the same people behind Trumps ads appear to be the same ones behind Gabbard. Go VPN and route through Michigan.
[comment]It was known a while ago that Russians were somehow contributing to her campaign, and there are is a high volume of bots for Tulsi on Reddit. I could see her running third party if Warren is the nominee.
[comment]Absolutely terrible take from HRC.
[comment]Right where is your proof? Is it these articles with a clear bias. Let’s not be gullible sheep.

She is a decorated national guard veteran who served in Iraq, and has served honorably as a senator for many years. You realize that CNN has their own staff calling out the bullshit lies internally right? There are leaked calls, go google it
[comment]Tulsi's a little upset.  [https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1185289626409406464](https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1185289626409406464)
[comment]I would not believe a word HC said even if those words were " I am Hillary Clinton". Gabbard has served this country faithfully for years and her record is exemplary.
[comment]It's nice to see McCarthyism coming back in a big way.
[comment]ITT: lots of defense of someone who loves chlorine bombs.

Could it be there is Republicans privilege?

I've been saying that one of the Democratic candidates without a chance should just start spouting Trump like rhetoric and behaving like him. If Republicans decry that behavior it might prompt them to examine their own cuckoo in the Whitehouse.

[comment]The whole reason he ran in the first place was because he is stone cold broke. He has to constantly restructure old loans to get enough cash from the restructuring to make it look like he's making payments. This kind of thing is EXACTLY what he was looking forward to when he ran only he expected it to be MUCH more lucrative than it has been so far and it's the ONLY thing he really cares about.
I'm hoping the next loan restructuring on the Chicago tower gets no takers and he defaults on that loan and ha to declare bankruptcy on it.

[comment]He does this by insisting that the campaign hold meetings in Trump tower and then charging his campaign full market price for the space or renting out the Trump jet from his business to the campaign at full market price. If I was a big GOP donor I'd probably be pretty pissed about this but I was never going to vote, volunteer or donate to Trump so I really don't give a shit how his campaign spends their donors money.

This is why trump we get re-elected he’s a great president who loves this country. I wish the dems would work with him to make things better for Americans instead of the coup attempts and disgusting politics.
[comment]Lol Democrat’s do this shit all the time, can’t be a hypocrite all of them should go to jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Chris Hayes: Trump Is ‘First and Foremost a Fox News Viewer’ Who Has Brought ‘Delusional Madness’ to WH
[selftext]https://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-hayes-trump-is-first-and-foremost-a-fox-news-viewer-who-has-brought-delusional-madness-to-wh/[comment]I really enjoy Chris' live shows on Friday evenings, he's really smart! I'm a Rachel Maddow fan, and was introduced to Hayes while tuning in to Rachel. Hayes has really done an excellent job of navigating the factual narrative of the polarized political climate. 

   That said I do actually read newspapers, and do not solely rely upon MSNBC for my news source!
[comment]Thank you. Amidst all the noise and chaos, it's important to zoom out and see the big picture: Fox News bears much of the responsibility for the collective insanity in our country, and Fox News will be easily able to create another Trump if he is voted out. 

What to do about it? Convincing friends and relatives not to watch Fox, asking businesses to turn off Fox in public places, boycotting its advertisers... Anything else?
[comment]All that has to happen is a generation of boomer morons has to die. We will come back to reality
[comment]And if we nominate a far leftist nutjob like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, he will stay there and create more madness.
[comment]Center has been swung so far right it's pathetic
[comment]Had Nixon 50 yrs ago, now Trump. The corporations control things. Until you take the money out of politics they'll just keep buying whoever is on top.
[comment]President Fox News Grandpa
[comment]The takeaway from this is that FOX viewers are delusional. We knew that already.
[comment]Entire generations have died repeatedly and here we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[title]Trump is facing bipartisan backlash for his handling of the coronavirus' spread in the US as the CDC warns 'this might be bad'
[selftext]https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-and-republicans-slam-trump-over-his-response-to-coronavirus-2020-2[comment]Thatll happen when you hack science budgets in favor of *checks notes* tax breaks for people and companies that have no need for them
[comment]Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced after trump closed them down. GENIUS, but hey everything’s ok right?  Idiot.
[comment]Stable genius
[comment]Well-oiled machine
[comment]And Trump is proposing cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the CDC, Medicare, and Medicaid.
[comment]Maybe trumbo should take one for the team and contract the virus, all while telling America it's not bad..
[comment]Better make sure there aren’t any “Never Trumpers” at the CDC before this gets out of hand.
[comment]His plan is literally, "Wait until it gets warmer outside."  This is where we are and you fucking assholes are all worried about "socialms!!" Please.  We need an adult in the room, ANY adult.
[comment]Guy doesn't seem to like people who know what they're doing so this is unfortunately no surprise. Maybe Hannity will clue him in. LOL, yeah that ain't gonna happen!
[comment]I’m an md, locally we are I’ll prepared. I just saw a patient who returned from Europe with cold symptoms and temp 99.8. Healthy and no real risk factors but his dad had questions. I called our local public health department and a snippy dude said call the information line. That line was a recording that if you had known contact with a patient with corona virus or have travelled to China and you have a fever SEE YOUR DOCTOR. I am the doctor, I need information.  I called our local lab, they don’t have the test. All the cdc says is only known contact or travel to China is a risk?!?!  What about Italy? This family was in mil pile airports with tourists from all over the world. We need better guidance than “see your doctor” when the doctors don’t know what to do
[comment]He thinks a big coronavirus issue could be “harmful to his re-election.”

The giant irony being that a sane and strong preventative response would probably help his re-election with moderates and more conservative Democrats.
[comment]Maybe if he and the Republicans could figure our how to make a profit from this they'd help? Otherwise we are screwed. Cash &gt; Human life and the health of our nation. Just show them a way to turn this into a money making opportunity and they'll be all for it. Sell it to 'em ya know. Maybe he can make a fuckin' deal.
[comment]I thought nobody knew as much about viruses than him... Or was it windmills, or technology, or nuclear weapons... no, it was golf! Nobody know more about golf that he does.
[comment]This orange moron is now saying that Coronavirus will disappear when it gets warmer out.  Vote this motherfucker out!
[comment]Alex Jones floated a conspiracy theory balloon that's going to politicize this like wildfire. People are going to die because of his callous disregard for the truth in the name of making a buck.
[comment]No he isn't. The Republicans don't give a shit until they start losing money.
[comment]Maybe the coronavirus likes fat orange blowhards? It couldn't happen to a more deserving person.
[comment]This was inevitable. Chickens coming home to roost.
[comment]We are screwed. We have an idiot in the White House who will call the virus fake news. Incompetent cabinet members, I'm sure Jared Kushner will be put in charge of this also. We live in a country where people dont vaccinate their kids. Where they dont have health insurance and cant afford medical costs. We will have a bunch of people curing their virus by putting potatoes slices in the socks and dabbing some peppermint oil on their collar while munching a CBD cookie.
[comment]Can't we just sharpie it out.
[comment]Maybe we will get lucky and the coronavirus will kill some of these sleazy old fucks in DC.
[comment]I have to come to your country next month, man, I feel so relieved reading this, that everything is ship shape.  Then again, it's not often you get to watch a Titanic remake happen in front of you.
[comment]When the virus arrives in the US it will be bad
[comment]....I mean OBVIOUSLY he needs to cut all gubmint funding of the CDC and nominate the AIDS-causing chimpanzee or that bat-soup-eating guy to that unfunded post.

(ps, downvote me all you want pc ppl. i don't care. i'm one of you whether you like it or not.  ps, set your dvrs to record stephen king's "the stand" except you might to actually read it.)<|endoftext|>

[selftext]https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html[comment]Is it the largest single-month surge ever in any primary?
[comment]Put on your coat and vote. We need to dethrone Joffrey.
[comment]Terrible news, for sure.
[comment]Uh-oh, the Bernie Bros aren't going to like that.
[comment]Bull.
[comment]What the fuck are people thinking? He's barely coherent.
[comment]I don't like him, but at least he's not going to veto good bills because they were written by Democrats
[comment]So 4 more years of Donald it is then
[comment]Lol you guys really think people like Biden? He just told people we need to reelect trump in his most recent gaffe yesterday. It's hilarious that he is the guy you guys want us to tow the party line behind
[comment]Biden will lose time Trump. Repeat of 2016 for sure.

<|startoftext|>[title]Trump Supporter Got What He Voted For after his wife gets deported to Mexico
[selftext]https://www.alternet.org/2020/02/sickening-2016-trump-voter-turns-on-the-president-after-his-wife-gets-deported-to-mexico/[comment]Paywall site. Please don't.
[comment]Like I feel bad, but I also don’t. More for the wife, him, fuck him he should be put through pin for voting for others to be put through it.
[comment]It's just like farmers who voted for Trump and end up filing bankruptcy. Too bad, suckers. You drank the Kool Aid.
[comment]I'm surprised someone with an immigrant wife would vote for him anyway...
[comment]LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO

Thoughts and prayers
[comment]Hahaha. Fucking hell.
[comment]These are pretty much my favorite stories in the Trump era.
[comment]Lol, this belongs on r/LeopardsAteMyFace
[comment]These people are voting their fears, resentments and prejudices and it will come back and bite everyone of them in the ass. You reap what you sow.
[comment]Stories like this or the ones about midwest farmers who supported Trump and are now so desperate that they're committing suicide make me laugh.

Racist fucks all deserve to suffer
[comment]Stupid is the common denominator.
[comment]Ahhh taste that delicious schadenfreude.
[comment]Why did she get deported if they were married?
[comment]Maybe he wanted her to get deported? I know I'm screwed.
[comment]This reminds me of a woman I went to college with. She has severe Crohn's disease and is always in and out of the hospital. Hardcore trump supporter. I asked her about him trying to get rid of the preexisting conditions protections and she just said it would never pass Congress. Wtf.
[comment]Mwah. Mwah. People are not that smart.
[comment]**Sad.**
[comment]It pays to read the fine print when dealing with Republicans.
[comment]r/LeopardsAteMyFace - 'I never thought leopards would eat MY face,' sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People's Faces Party.
[comment]FINALLY somebody sees that separating families and tearing livelihoods apart is NOT something a president should be doing. I don’t care if this dude doesn’t vote for a dem, I am just glad his eyes were opened.

Also, can we take a moment and think about the 4-year old son? This father was basically forced into being a single father, while the mother is possible hundreds of miles away, wishing and wanting to see her baby and kiss her baby. The child must have been devastated to learn that mommy had been taken away. Mother’s Day is coming up in a few months and I hope that this child doesn’t feel too down or depressed about this whole issue. I hope she is home ASAP. It’s probably difficult for the mother to give financial support as well. The father has to work for the child, care for the child and love the child all on his own without the mother who can only watch and hope to return.
[comment]i thought if you got married you were granted citizenship?
[comment]Adios...
[comment]So VOTE. Tell everyone you know to VOTE. This is not right.
[comment]Elections have consequences.
[comment]Cursed divorce
[comment]Sending snots and flares to Jason... I'm all out of thoughts and prayers.
[comment]They were one of the families on Living Undocumented on Netflix. It follows a couple of families as they live without papers. Some of the scenes with ICE are shocking

[comment]Karma!
[comment]We all sleep in the bed we make.
[comment]I'm Mexican-American, and I have a handful of people in my extended family who voted for Trump. They're Idiots. They get treated wit racism at rallies and then say well it's not all of them, just a few bad eggs. Half have lost them jobs and all are constantly borrowing money, but they tell us things are about to turn around, we just need to keep supporting Trump. If you try to explain how Trumps policies are targeting them they act like you're a fool. You tell them how the Democrats would benefit them better, and they say, "well that's not what Trump said". We've realized nothing will change their minds, so now they just get invited out less and less.
