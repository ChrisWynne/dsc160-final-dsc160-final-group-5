[title]Charlotte Alter: If Warren drops out[selftext]https://twitter.com/CharlotteAlter/status/1235246862287777792[comment]&gt;Put another way: despite their ideological similarities
&gt;And the way many high-profile Warren supporters have been treated by the Bernie base doesn't help.

&gt;Anecdotally-- I'm hearing from Warren voters saying they now plan to vote for Biden[comment]Frankly she should just endorse Biden at this point. It would do a lot to help unify the party and clear the lane for Biden[comment]Looking at this another way: If 50% of Warren supporters would vote for Sanders[comment]This fits me really well.   It is almost my exact reasoning.
[comment]God y‚Äôall are so intolerable. If you have your way Trump will be re-elected.
[comment]As a Bernie supporter
My wife is disabled and I work 54 hours a week so I don't think I'm your average Bernie supporter. I feel like running around and yelling at people but that's not how you win people over. I'm just so frustrated with everything.

I will 100% back whoever the Dem nominee is[comment]We're being held hostage by scared children that want to go back to pretending nothing's more concerning that the next episode of Jersey Shore.
[comment]"*sometimes* aggressive base"

Lol!üòÑ
[comment]It still makes me laugh how disillusioned Bernie supporters are on social media. They assume they're always being cheated and bully the supporters of other candidates but get super upset when you stand up to them. Alter is 100% right[comment]As a Yang supporter I got *extremely* negative vibes from Bernie Bros. I still voted for Bernie[comment]Warren's voters are HER voters.  They are not Bernie's by default.  She is not "stealing" his votes.  She has earned *hers*. 

Isn't that what Bernie supporters have said for the last 4 years? You have to "EARN" my vote?

So Bernie and his sycophants
If a person is still supporting Warren[comment]I don‚Äôt worry about Warren voters voting blue in November
Warren should be getting praise today for single handedly ending Bloomberg‚Äôs undemocratic run[comment]I voted for Warren in our primary. I‚Äôm a white college educated liberal who thinks she would make a terrific executive even if she isn‚Äôt the best campaigner. 

If I had to choose between Bernie and Biden...I‚Äôd probably choose Biden. I agree with Bernie‚Äôs values but I‚Äôm deeply skeptical about his ability to be an effective executive. 

Biden
I‚Äôll be out knocking doors for the winner either way.
[comment]I condemn a lot of the worst behaviour from Bernie supporters but people need to understand that Bernie represents the some of the most disenfranchised and marginalized people in American society. He polls strongest with young people of every race[comment]Bracing for the misogynistic backlash against Warren if she doesn‚Äôt fully endorse Sanders in *3[comment]I totally understand the Warren fan sentiment
I have posted over on some Bernie subs (I'm a Bernie supporter: surprise!) that Warren's base doesn't owe us a damn thing
Bernie definitely has some immature people making loud noises and doing obnoxious
For the record I do not believe that Biden has a snowballs chance in hell in beating Trump[comment]Imagine being so clueless that you think how someone delivers their message or deals with others is irrelevant in politics. Then imagine also believing you should  run an entire political party.
[comment]Warren voters will not vote for Sanders according to my Twitter feed.
[comment]Dude what ever. Nah sayers. Have some hope.
[comment]I can't bring myself to support either Biden or Bernie. Or any man. I want Warren. She is best prepared to deal with the dumpster fire Trump will leave us. She has proven her understanding of good government. 
If Trump survives to campaignI will not canvassNo more white men. Sorry.
[comment]But Biden would be more likely to keep Trump in power than Bernie...
[comment]They will if she drops out and endorses Bernie
[comment]well i like bernie and warren both .. but if the democratic elite (corporate )

try to screw bernie or warren then i am voting for trump .. to heck with the dems .... they have fought for corps to many times and now biden is trying to get in
[comment]I would suspect most of her supporters would back Bernie if she endorses Bernie and starts campaigning for him because if he wins
People need to get tougher skin if a few internet trolls bother them that much.
[comment]Biden is Republican lite. Warren railed against him and his ilk and said she would support most of the same policies as Bernie. I cannot fathom  her or her followers supporting Biden over Bernie.
[comment]Sounds like the corporatist talking point of the day.

If they want Trump gone maybe Bidens gaffes and being on both sides of so many issues is worse
[comment]"It would be great if people didn't die when they have no health insurance

I came across a man lying in the middle of the street one morning and I realized he was having a heart attack. I ran to get help

How do these people sleep knowing the death count for their inaction is in the thousands.
[comment]I'm picking the ideologically opposite candidate because some random people were mean to me on the interwebz.

It's funny
It's not like Bernie is calling for the burning of churches here. Its literally infuriating that people can actually blow such dumb nonsense out of proportion.

But it serves us right
And now comes Biden. Any Democrat that thinks this entire Burisma thing looks 100% clean is straight up delusional. The GOP told Trump to quiet down and save that ammo for the general. It's the only reason they stopped with Burisma. The republicans are withholding all their attacks. There's more related to Hunter
I get it; he's better than Trump. But my god can we stop handing Republican's our nominee on a silver platter with an apple in his mouth? 

If we lose this election I'll be expecting a new party[comment]Sorry to say[comment]Biden has no chance to beat trump. If she supports him she cares more about pleasing the establishment than her actual positions on any issue.
[comment]Sorry someone is angry at her. this is serious and everyone knows biden=4 more years of trump. So people should be pissed.  If she supports biden she is not progressive[comment]I'm so torn over all this because I want a progressive candidate so badly. Warren[comment]That is a cool way to paint Bernie as an extremist ... very cool and so unfair subtly nasty I think.      
Yes quite nasty.     
She doesn't blame it on Bernie but his baseAnd of course the base is placed aside to the educated liberals who naturally like Ms Warren ... sorry but I am a little bit educated and I like Mr Sanders.       

She also gives us the practical key work as opposed to what ?  ... solving issues ? Because this is the focus of Bernie's action.      
So the revolution ending shot rings like the bells of the Churches of Petrograd in 1917. But wait Bernie is absolutely not Lenin ... this is not an Alter net reality here.     
No   
And I don't think that Canada or Europe are that much revolutionary and I am quite impressed by their health care system.
[comment]Two words: Russian trolls. Y‚Äôall are falling into the exact same trap as 2016.
[comment]If we are practical and want Trump gone above all else
He is benefiting so much from people not really paying attention to him because other candidates were more fun to talk about. He won't last in actually watched debates.

He is much less likely to win. This panic at Bernie is insane and self destructive. 

I love Warren. She's made some political mistakes that annoy me[comment]Berniecrat here.

I was immediately totally banned from the Warren subreddit for making a common sense suggestion to not make her campaign entirely about her gender.

I don't care what happens to her if they want that kind of policing.

Biden is a million times better than Trump but he'd rather please white nationalists and insurance companies than produce clean progressive legislation.  I'll be voting for Biden if it cones down to that but only for the Supreme Court because anything he tries to do will be gimped by extreme white nationalist oligarchs.
[comment]Count me as one who has been alienated by Bernie's usually aggressive base. I don't buy the "oh they're just passionate" b.s. anymore.
[comment]That could be true. The only thing we know for sure is that warren is NOT a viable candidate in this race. Voters have spoken; she got THIRD in her home state. It doesn‚Äôt matter where her supporters go but she needs to drop. It‚Äôs a two person race now.
[comment]Boomers have spoken[comment]I'm one of these people.  I'm voting for Warren on Tuesday
At this point
I started feeling cautious optimism this year as things went on - but this is going to be another election of memes.
[comment]Unfortunately[comment]I‚Äôm hoping for Sanders Warren 2020.
[comment]I don't know why anybody would pick Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren. She's actually accomplished things and is exactly the right age to be President.

I also don't know why people would assume that Warren supporters would be more likely to go with Sanders than Biden. Personally[comment]What a cowardly attitude[comment]That‚Äôs me. I was a Warren voter[comment]What a load of Orwellian doublespeak. "That Joe Biden is double plus good"!
[comment]‚ÄúThey want Trump gone more than they want a revolution‚Äù. You can literally have both[comment][https://apnews.com/0db953743c56cd6fd6e4ef73e02f120c](https://apnews.com/0db953743c56cd6fd6e4ef73e02f120c)

[title]AP Interview: Sanders says opposing Biden is 'irresponsible'
[selftext]https://apnews.com/a1bfb62e37fe34e09ff123a58a1329fa[comment]You can either function for Trump's protofascist movement or against it. 

##**There is no neutral on a moving train**

If you do not function against Trump's protofascist movement
Now is when we separate the compassionate and mindful from the credulous and self-absorbed. 

There is no neutral on the racism train either. You can either function against a white supremacist president
Are you with us[comment]And sadly he is correct...after that all bet a are off defeat Trump first. Than whatever impeach Biden I don't care
[comment]I'll always be a Bernie bro[comment]Bernie knows Donald trump is an existential threat to not only Americans[comment]Bernie is a very sensible and moral man. He was never going to throw in with Trump.
[comment]That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying and getting down-voted.
[comment]He‚Äôs right. Either you vote Biden or you‚Äôre voting for Trump (by voting third party or not voting at all).
[comment]Sanders is right. Every time the Democratic candidate has lost it's because someone on the Left split the vote.
[comment]Fuck yeah it is. Thank you Bern!
[comment]Sellout LOL
[comment]I still oppose Biden and the conservative-center of the party. 

I just oppose the GOP a hell of a lot more.
[comment]Anyone who thinks there's no difference between Trump and Biden
https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/
[comment]didn‚Äôt reddit call Yang a sellout for endorsing Biden also?
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to influence Biden‚Äôs campaign and allow a vision that works for both voter groups.

And fix the SCOTUS.
[comment]You mean that Trump isn‚Äôt honoring his commitments? Shocking!! üò±
[comment]Gotta hand it to the guy. Shame he‚Äôs out of the race.
[comment]So he finally learned how badly he damaged Clinton...I curse both trump and Bernie with the same breath...

[title]Bernie Sanders drops out of 2020 Democratic presidential primary
[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/bernie-sanders-drops-out-of-2020-democratic-presidential-primary.html[comment]I didn‚Äôt even get to vote in a primary before everyone dropped out. This is why we need a national primary day instead of a 6 month spread.
[comment]Finally did the right thing[comment]The writing was on the wall.  For better or worse[comment]I‚Äôd vote for my dog if I felt like the pup had a chance of taking the White House.  I‚Äôd have voted for Bernie had he been the nominee.  My sympathies to his die-hard supporters but there‚Äôs only one choice in the matter now.
[comment]I hope Bernie continues to fight hard to oust Trump and also reform healthcare in some way--perhaps not exactly the way he envisioned but in some capacity.
[comment]Fuck[comment]No refunds lol
[comment]We should be totally focused on trump now.
[comment]Biden is about as appealing as a bowl of room temperature mayonnaise.
[comment]So let me get this right[comment]sad
[comment]I'm surprised.  Maybe he thought it was best to come together[comment]Even if I can't elect Bernie[comment]Ah yes
Not a Bernie supporter at all and I do think Biden is the "best bet." But holy shit this is like saying the Oklahoma is the best bet of the Big 12 to win it all - its true but you'd much rather have a top team from any other Power 5 be your team.

My fear is he doesn't have the fight. He's too enlightened centrist to me. When/if the death toll hits 100k
Is it too late to draft Cuomo?
[comment]Blue. No. Matter. Who.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. I liked Bernie. I voted for him in my states primary. But Biden has been winning the primaries left and right. 

Think of it this way. Who would you rather pick the next Supreme Court Justice: Trump or Biden?
[comment]So
Sounds like that group wasnt supporting Bernie at all.
[comment]Sanders has left the race and I feel that many of us will miss him for better or worst. Now[comment]Alright people[comment]Biden should tap Obama for the VP spot
[comment]‚ÄúJoe Biden is a man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the well being of working families and the middle class‚Äù

- Bernie Sanders[comment]Welp so much for my vote.
[comment]Unify or die is pretty much what it comes down to.

[comment]Trump‚Äôs own mental fitness is on now for all to see with these Corona Virus pieces on TV
[comment]I am worried about how general election voters will respond to Biden's gaffes. I think that the Democratic Party should nominate a candidate who does not have that problem.

[comment]Biden endorsed trump
[comment]So you're saying that for once Trump and his cronies are being honest. This is indeed an awkward moment.

[comment]Round two of putting a bad candidate with a scandal into the general election
I can't wait to hear the excuses as to why we need another "moderate" aka do nothing
Maybe we can run Hunter next. Gotta make sure it's a moderate with a scandal and all
Bring on the downvotes nerds.
[comment]Obviously the attacks on Bidens son are entirely reprehensible and I hope whoever the nominee is they strongly condemn them and fight back by pointing out the blatant illegality and ethical failures of the Trump administration in hiring his own children who are woefully under qualified for the positions they hold the time for the moral high ground for Democrats needs to be over. As far as Biden lacking the mental fitness to run the country I fully agree although it should be said so does Trump and we would be a lot safer and more prosperous under Joe no doubt but it's a weakness they will exploit and I fear he would lose. More concerning though is the Republican and Democratic establishments conviction and premature coronation of Biden as the nominee. I hope it doesn't go that way. He is and always has been Republican light with policies and votes going back decades that hurt Democratic values and economically vulnerable people. He won't be able to beat Trump by offering him out behind the woodshed and mixing his lines up. Bernie would be able to as the polling has shown for months by having the mental conditioning of a much younger man and the guts to go where is needed with rhetoric. Shame all of the nominees are old men in their swan songs and a shame so many people are frightened of the only Democratic candidate that espouses traditional Democratic values Joe leaning to the left now is disengenuous and risible.
[comment]I've seen some of this on Reddit already and I'm wondering if it is coming from Russian sources.
[comment]Ironic
[comment]Not sure why the Dems backing him.  Bernie and Elizibeth would be a good pick for President and VP.
[comment]What a shit show (and will only get bigger &amp; more ridiculous come November.) The rnp has no bar that they won't crawl under..and they will play EVERY dirty trick in the book..I've always been proud (in general) that the left has a standard- fair[comment]And it's true.

 Hahshahhahaha Trump is one to talk..no surprise he said this.
[comment]I mean he is bumbling.
[comment]For those of you that are saying that you can't believe what the attacks are going to be like later on here's how it's going to be[comment]That's been happening for the last year or so.
[comment]They are working on me. I‚Äôm voting Dems no matter what but I‚Äôve seen the videos and Biden DOES sound like he‚Äôs losing brain function terribly. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve doubled my efforts in phone banking for Sanders. I literally just see him as a slam dunk on Trump.
[comment]That last part is rich[comment]Trump is nothing compared to Corn Pop

[comment]That's what you get for swimming in the deep end. He should've never even been here to begin with. Just like Trump[comment]Not a fan of his[comment]I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt just walk off stage. How embarrassing! Warren just proved that she can handle a misogynistic idiot better than anyone.
[comment]This is like that one episode where Piper Perri got surrounded
[comment]He sucks so bad. I was mad that he was being allowed on the debate stage and after tonight I'm happy he was allowed on. Now everyone can see him for what he is. An old out of place rich man who has no clue as to what the american people want or like.
[comment]I actually felt badly for him.     He looked like he was going to cry.  Its sad!!   Whether or not you were planning on voting for him/like him the guy IS a legitimate businessperson and smart as heck (although he didn't come off this way).   He also didn't bully other candidates back (i.e. Trump).

 No need for another.

[comment]Great video. It is so true that people don't care about the lies. Tried to convince my office that a leader speaking truth on TV matters and they just reply with "all of them lie." It's so disappointing and frustrating. 

Unfortunately I don't think Biden can effectively do what the video suggests against the incumbent.
[comment]Yup I don't know how this guy does it.
[comment]Well done.
[comment]They tend to say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äú and that they know what he means/meant but seriously he doesn‚Äôt know what he means so how can they????

[comment]Because they're liars.

[comment]Nothing anyone does is ever going to move the needle below 32%. That‚Äôs all he needed last election. What we need is to reach people who normally don‚Äôt vote or who flipped from Bernie to trump last time. That‚Äôs it. Little else is worth discussing.

It's important to realize that people have been diagnosing the Trump phenomenon for as long as he's been in the public and political theaters. Not much of what she is saying is new.

[comment]What's funny is[comment]As a people we cultivated and allowed these adults to develop this way and now we get what we deserve.
[comment]Good video[comment]We need to build time-out centers in every shitty backwater town where these inbreeds show they‚Äôve learned that the only difference between being five and being an adult is that you can get away with being a dickhead as an adult. There‚Äôs no way to win with idiots.
[comment]Yes.  There is a role for policy and strategy which he won't understand or be able to counter.

But I agree with Bill Maher that Dems need to be less nice.  Trump is going to hit below that belt pretty hard.  He banks on his opponents weaknesses and shadiness.  To think we can remain "better than him" morally and kinder and expect to win is crazy.  Dems need to sling some mud too...and he's given us mountains of it to fling right back at him!
[comment]Trump is a product of right-wing media[comment]Of course. Appeal to emotion. Cognitive dissonance between feelings of inadequacy and superiority. It‚Äôs the same with conspiracy theory nuts
Very simply
You see it in republican policies too. It‚Äôs always about not letting anyone else get anything extra. It‚Äôs about applying negative consequences to others. 

Its people with damaged egos. It‚Äôs pretty easy to see. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs true; it makes me feel better‚Äù 

Also[comment]1. Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of 3 Million. She lost the Electoral College and she lost it by less than a million votes in states that are usually a Democratic win
2. The voters who support Trump no matter what
3. The voters we can appeal to are the ones who voted for Obama
I never understood why so many people hated Hillary on such a personal level
I don't think there is a big group of Biden haters. I don't think he has that kind of baggage. I don't think most people really care about Hunter Biden. The sexual assault allegations are disturbing
The Electoral College is a terribly unfair system and always has been. We're stuck with it until they can pass a constitutional amendment against it[comment]I posted another comment but I decided to let this one stand alone. 

This information is not a surprise. It‚Äôs the fundamental pillar of their entire strategy. All the misinformation and attempts to shape public opinion so blatantly. 

It started with Steve Bannon and World of Warcraft. He realized there exists a population of people who feel like they aren‚Äôt good enough or the world is screwing them over. This original group was the Incels on World of Warcraft. 

Bannon realized these people would manipulate their reality in order to make themselves look better to others
So he created Cambridge Analytica. This combined with existing misinformation systems
It‚Äôs truly fascinating how effective this has worked
Edit:  their image of trump is a rich and famous person who has power over everyone and gets to ‚Äústick it‚Äù to those who ‚Äúare mean‚Äù to him.  If I become rich and famous and powerful
It‚Äôs like a kid who was bullied In school dreaming of becoming a famous fighter.
[comment]Oh yeah[comment]Did she just say that Trump supporters have the reasoning of a 5 year old
If they don't listen to substance and don't care about policy[comment]Honestly they aren't even human beings. They are a disease that must be destroyed before it can spread
[comment]Yeah! Hillary never lied!
[comment]My dad can beat up your dad!!
[comment]I'm going to disagree. Facts are good[comment]"When you are overcome with powerlessness
You have to make fun of him and make him appear weak.
[comment]No[comment]Oh Biden‚Äôs definitely losing then
[comment]That's me - "CRYY... 'in. The blues!"
[comment]The sad thing is
The only surefire way to convince Trump voters to abandon him is for them to feel like he's abandoned them. Unfortunately
As much as I want stay-at-home orders to remain in effect until the threat is manageable
You can't shoot a virus. You can't vote against it. You can't write a law to stop it or make a deal with disease. There's no military or policy action that makes it go away.
[comment]I really think she came to the wrong conclusion.  As the first parts of the video explain[comment]So.... Bernie then?????
[comment]This is an insult to my 5 year old daughter.  She‚Äôs way more emotionally intelligent than that.
[comment]Cuomo already knows how to do this. I hope Biden gets it.
[comment]it would have been more effective to keep interviewing trump supporters
[comment]Most of them have the intellect of a 5 year old.
[comment]I have VERY little respect for Trump and his blind followers who can‚Äôt think for themselves. Maybe I will if they can advance their thinking to at LEAST a 10-year-old‚Äôs level<|startoftext|>
[title]Joe Biden on Twitter: I don't care who you're supporting[selftext]https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1236023348481724416[comment]Amen.
[comment]Well said
We may disagree on policy or who the better candidate is[comment]Amen Joe.
[comment]Like Republicans Joe? Like Republicans?
[comment]Now if only Bernie would shut down those BernieBots...
[comment]This is the unity Joe brings. Thank you!
[comment]100% agree[comment]Great words. It's time we got above this crap. 

Problem is with the interwebs[comment]This shows what a decent man he is. This is the man we want in the White House[comment]ThanksStill voting Bernie
[comment]Joe has my vote!
[comment]This was strategic but still a good thing to do.  Thanks Joe.

Still voting Bernie
[comment]Correct.
[comment]When are people going to wake up and realize all this hate[comment]hatred and bigotry are all the right has. its the theme of every one of trumps klan rallies
[comment]Wonder what Trump 's tweet about it would be
[comment]Joe's quickly becoming electable
[comment]Seems like a stunt.  Who was that guy ans what was he paid?
[comment]I don't know where the original story is but just r by eading some of the posts I can tell what it was about[comment]Thanks
I will vote for you and fight hard for you if you win[comment]This is what a real man looks like. joe biden has mine vote. Does he have yours?

Vote BLUE NO MATTER WHO. unite to fight the alt right.
[comment]Bernie was all about unity at his rally tonight too.  He did a good job of saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in this together and he has my support but here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm better.‚Äù  They‚Äôre aware of what R u ss i a is doing and doing a great job of combatting it.  Remember that.  If it seems divisive[comment]To bad he can't say a sentence this eloquently.
[comment]I‚Äôm happy that he‚Äôs being classy and humble. That‚Äôs the only way we can defeat trump. Unity
[comment]I voted for Warren. No regrets. And no matter which of these two wins the primary[comment]Tell 'em[comment]We have to pull together and vote for the nominee. Even if it‚Äôs Biden. I hate these nazi scumbags and especially that nazi pos in the WH
[comment]I'm not supporting Biden in the primaries[comment]Found directly at the Whitehouse in Washington DC where the orange maggot lives
[comment]I see people talking about Elizabeth Warren and to be honest I don't agree with all her policies but I don't agree with all of anyone's 100%[comment]I had no idea he was Jewish
[comment]The comments which are now deleted were vile. I'm disheartened. If you cannot look at a man condemning anti-Semitism and say simply say "Good": Fuck you[comment]Good!

I like Joe but I don't think he can beat trump and I worry about his memory.  

But the above message is exactly the thing Trump should be saying.  It's how a leader behaves!

Well done Joe and while you're on a role...

...Biden own campaign recently told Sanders
So I'd next like to see Biden explain that behaviour 
 Stop all the racism and bigotry from the top up!
[comment]This was a tough one[comment]I wonder if he apologized to the woman he called[comment]I voted for Bernie in my primary[comment]What were the attacks?
[comment]Nicely said Joe. I can‚Äôt vote or anything (and sorry[comment]Niw here is a decent man who in despite of his attacks from Sanders still defend Sanders jewish ancestry...would Sanders do the same? ??? NO
[comment]We need to unite and rally behind whoever gets the nomination. We have one single goal thisncycle: defeat trumpism. 
  
Also  
And stopping the stacking of the courts.
 
And restoring environmental regs.

And tackling climate change.
  
I mean: I want Medicare for all but I‚Äôll be a fucking deadman if I lose my ACA coverage.

[title]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how pathetic and awful a significant amount of republicans are?
[selftext]Like it was obvious before but Jesus now it‚Äôs slapping you in the face. The protests[comment]No[comment]Not exposed; just confirmed it in bright neon.
[comment]It confirms that many Republicans have decided to listen to their lesser angels[comment]Karma will surely serve them a plate of covefe 19...üòÜ
[comment]This is literally all they've ever been. Even the corporate sellouts in our camp have the decency to at least pretend they care about human life.
[comment]Hatefulness has a political party. It's never been more obvious.
[comment]Yes. I‚Äôve been trying to assume the point of view of trumpists/republicans and I caught myself thinking: The way we view them is most likely the way they view us. They‚Äôre incapable of seeing the light. They look at us like we‚Äôre the bad guys just like we view them. Just a thought.
[comment]Yes. The surprise is how many Democrats this has exposed as not having the best interests of the people or the Democratic process in mind. Our system is truly broken and beyond repair.
[comment]They deserve to lose every election for the next hundred years. As it is[comment]I think it was perfectly obvious before Covid-19...but maybe that's just me? ü§î
[comment]You could have groups shooting people in the streets and there would still be a good amount of money and power supporting them because it's more profitable to have the American people fighting each other
[comment]Of the two parties- only the GOP tries to suppress the vote. Limit voting places[comment]C19 has VALIDATED HOW COMPLETELY VILE THE REPEWBS ARE.    BLUE WAVE!
[comment]Just par for the course really. Money rules that party and you are a means for them to get richer. 

If anything
As well[comment]I mean[comment]Absolutely. And I hope we don‚Äôt forget it once we get Trump out of office. We might be friendly for now with ‚Äúmoderate Republicans‚Äù who hate Trump
Healthcare is a human right. Climate change is real. Immigrants make our country stronger in nearly every way. Women have a right to their own bodies. Voting rights matter. The GOP denied these fundamental truths long before Trump took office and they will do so even after he leaves.
[comment]It was already confirmed. This just reinforces it.
[comment]From my perspective[comment]I don‚Äôt think it needed confirmation.
[comment]I don't think anyone has the market cornered on bad decisions. Covid 19 just adds insult to injury.
[comment]They really have shown their true colors
[comment]Coronavirus isn't in human form and they can't apply the politics of personal destruction to something that can't speak
There is no straw man that can be made here.  It doesn't care about your politics and it also can't be vilified so Skeeter can say he's mad it wore a tan suit or "What about the coronavirus's emails?!!" in a feigned fit of outrage.
[comment]We as Democrats need to FINALLY grow a sack and play the game on the same terms as they are or they will just continue on doing whatever the hell they want as they have been doing since the 1970‚Äôs.....üòî
[comment]Conservatives subreddit is absolute cancer
[comment]Yes! A lot of Trumpicans can't bear the thought that their leader has fumbled this crisis hard so they shun reality and the science behind it. And as we've seen from the armed protests and two pipebomb arrests[comment]Republicans have been this awful my entire life. I feel like younger people just were totally not exposed to them on such a massive scale under the previous 8 years of Obama.
[comment]The insecurity is borne by the realization that this is the nail in Trump's coffin. Up till the coronavirus[comment]Known for a while now
[comment]You better VOTE!!!
[comment]We already knew lol. We can only hope it‚Äôs been exemplified to those who are more moderate. I think what‚Äôs it‚Äôs really shown is blind loyalty to party lines
People and politicians who are acting like total a**holes in all of this. The ones disobeying mandates[comment]I wasn‚Äôt surprised just very

Pls Vote in November.
[comment]It's been obvious for a while but this has hopefully exposed how awful conservatives are to anybody who was considering voting against their own best interests and voting for them
[comment]It exposed just how terrible our government as a whole is. To say one half did amazing while the other half did piss poor is quite off base. It‚Äôs not cute when they‚Äôre in Washington bickering like children over legislation. They all get a huge thumbs down from me.
[comment]Thing that gets me is the fear based denial. And then they'll roll over and play the victim just to blame you for exercising a measured response for dealing with the fearful reality of a global pandemic.
[comment]The mental gymnastics required to support Trump and his boot-lickers at this point are truly mind boggling.
[comment]Yes. Yes I do.
[comment]Pressure exposes patterns.
[comment]"Your deaths for rich people are a sacrifice I am more than willing to make." /Republicans more or less (Probably)
[comment]I don't think it's fair to compare as Democrat vs Republican. I typically vote red but I'm still at home and don't agree with the protesting idiots and I also wouldn't call myself a republican. I think a significant amount of those "republicans" are just people who operate from their lower brain and spout Trump as their savior. Can you really be so far in one camp or the other to label yourself?

I guess my thought is that I wish people were more idea/policy leaning than red/blue team leaning. I've never voted a straight ticket...
[comment]Nah[comment]Depends on how sensitive you are to this sort of thing.

If you are highly sensitive
If you were just sensitive
If you were moderately interested but not sensitive to this sort of thing at all
If you had a passing interest
If your interest wasn't passing but you had any awareness
If you don't know by now either you are one of them or you have your head up your ass and like it there[comment]I think the absolute craziest part for me is that there are people out there that not only are on with this but support it in a full throated manner
[comment]Yes. Everyday Every second Every issue
[comment]I think it‚Äôs exposed how pathetic and awful a lot of people are
[comment]All. All of them.
[comment]Hey[comment]Imagine you could see all the headlines of just this year about what the GOP and trump has done during the 2016 election. 

Think ‚ÄúHer Emails‚Äù would have been an issue?
[comment]I‚Äôve seen quite a bit of bigotry of late. Almost exclusively from my non democrat friends. I was surprised at how many self described independents have hate as well
[comment]Ok
I'm probably closest to a republican as things go... How does this expose anything?
[comment]I think Trump did that. Before he came along I thought they deserved a seat at the table.
[comment]You're just saying that because you want your party to be in power.

/S
[comment]No. Definitely not. It exposed how underestimating we we were.
[comment]I agree with the general sentiment[comment]Conservative here. There is a reason I call myself a conservative and not a republican. The Republican Party platform contradicts itself on so many instances I just can‚Äôt. I still hold right wing views[comment]it has shown me how pathetic ALL our politicans are.  driven by party politics and greed.
[comment]I‚Äôm not sure you noticed[comment]It shows that both parties don't care about us. Not just Republicans. Do you guys really think the Democrats are working for you and not there corporate donors?
[comment]You mean every day*
[comment]Every damn week[comment]Whats just as bad is people believing whatever they are told. This ridiculous "Plandemic" video has gotten me in trouble with family because it makes me so angry that they watch and believe what these nutjobs are saying!
[comment]Every day the indecency is more obvious. If Americans were really the kind of people that I grew up thinking they were[comment]People in general...
[comment]No .
[comment]Does anyone else feel like covid-19 has truly exposed how stupid and awful a significant amount of Democrats are?
[comment]Lol you're just speaking the truth based on facts.

No think.

The covid massacre has shown 1) how fucking dangerous China under xi really is.  2) that trump really has no empathy.  3) that his supporters are brainwashed and or evil.  4) the gop are fucking terrorists and traitors who put human life after personal gain.  5) America is heading towards it's 3rd civil war.
[comment]I feel like it‚Äôs not fair to make a general statement that states all republicans are like this. While I disagree with many

But yeah[comment]No I‚Äôve know for near thirty years how gross pathetic and awful republicans and conservatives are. They are a blight and cancer on this nation and in their own way a population forcing the rest of us to be better and confront the awfulness that is a hallmark of their ideology.
[comment]Have you seen r/trump? My god the people on that sub are small but make up for it ok stupidity.
[comment]just wondering what platform they will campaign on in future elections. they have flipped on everything.no morals[comment]I really want to caution anyone who will listen from adopting this attitude. At the end of the day
Are there some really shorty republicans elected officials right now? I would say yes. This is most likely due to the fact that republicans more commonly get elected
We the people are the ones who control whether these officials get to remain in power[comment]You know how they say that money doesn't change a person but rather exposed who they really are?  With covid-19[comment]Covid-19 just reveals what‚Äôs been revealed time and again with Republicans not standing up to the Liar in Chief[comment]The democrats should also be grouped into this
[comment]Especially Rush Limbaugh. His show became exclusively blame the left all day. 
I have listened to it for many years out of interest in the Republican arguments. It was fun to try and deconstruct his craziness and see how he attempted to influence his listeners in roundabout ways.
But now it's straight "the left is evil and wants to destroy America" all dayThen I switch to NPR where they use facts and real people's stories...
[comment]Just read about Germans before World War Two. Republicanism is the same. A garbage culture fueled by ignorance and hatred.
[comment]Democrats too[comment]If the pandemic is the thing that finally is making you see that...fuck you...they have been heartless demons for years now...not that the dems do anything to really stop them though...
[comment]It's also exposed how weak and feckless most democratic leadership is as well. Fuck the republicans but damned if pelossi and shcumer arent more useless than tits on a fish.
[comment]Cancerous traitorous monsters
[comment]Nah it‚Äôs just confirmed that people priorities are whipping there ass and having a fashionable face mask I mean if you look at that way you shouldn‚Äôt have any political say lol if ya think about it we all live in the same place and should have similar goals and yet we have two parties with conflicting goals which leads one to ask why? Personally I think they in it together and use the media to divide people to obtain their personal goals so In away your halfway right but instead of keeping a better eye on one side how bout keeping full attention on the whole fuck show
[comment]I am 36. 

For me it was the Iraq War. For people before that it was Reagan. Bush 1 was[comment]About 10% more than I felt I knew. But I think it's more public now
[comment]Trump is vowing to destroy Obamacare in a pandemic; we gave the most extensive distribution of wealth in history to billionaires[comment]I live in Salt Lake city
It's almost as if being a selfish bastard is a requirement for the republican party these days.
[comment]It's almost like Mother Nature said 'you didnt get it with Irma[comment]Let's not forget the Dems too. Utter disappointment across the board. We need a new party that truly represents the working class.
[comment]Confirmed it for sure. Pure evil. One of my Pok√©mon friends left our 3 year group chat because we were complaining about the Rs
[comment]The huge number of Republican conservatives who don't believe the virus is real or that it's made by the government blows my mind. I have friends who call it the "plandemic."
[comment]Omg have you seen all their plandemic posts lately
[comment]You must be new here
[comment]Here's an idea. How about stop being so hateful just because people have different political views than you. This world will be better if people looked past these differences instead of this tribal partisan crap
[comment]Not really. It's always been pretty obvious to me.
[comment]I did Nazi this coming.

Seriously though
Unfortunately[comment]I‚Äôm republican and even I question my own party. We‚Äôre protesting against science and bowing to a man who hasn‚Äôt helped[comment]Not since Covid[comment]Largely
I still think there has to be room for dissent from mainstream thought (which I believe leans more from moderate left to far left) but yeah[comment]It highligts there low inteligece in extrem stiuations like this[comment]Democrats have been screaming hysterically for 3 years about nonsensical Russian conspiracy theories
You guys need to have your heads examined.

[title]New Rule: Just because Fox News is obsessed with the Biden sex assault allegations[selftext]https://youtu.be/Ju1ZFuvjzYc[comment]#AMEN!
[comment]If only they covered the 25+ Trump accusations. It's a little less credible you are innocent when a dozen women accusing you isn't even half of the total number.
[comment]Well this was eye opening... üëÅüëÅ
[comment]I'd broaden that: just because cable TV news fixates on certain stories (those differ between networks) doesn't mean anyone else needs to fixate on them.

I recall a few years ago when Lawrence O'Donnell had Michael Avenati on his show almost daily.

What sells the most ads may not be what provides the best information for the citizenry.
[comment]And once again....right wingers and Bernie Bro‚Äôs team up. And no one can extrapolate this unholy alliance to the notion that Russian and the Trump administration is in cahoots to keep this shit relevant?

I sincerely find it amusing that the Limbaugh crowd constantly talks about right wingers having this almost supernatural ability for ‚ÄúCritical thinking‚Äù
I find it equally amusing that the ‚ÄúFeel the Bern‚Äù people are so ‚Äúwoke‚Äù...but cannot admit to it that they are being played.

The sad thing about the Bernie people? Is that they fell for it in 2016....they were so CONVINCED that Clinton had a sex trafficking ring in the basement of a pizza shop. You would think that they‚Äôd be ‚Äúwoke‚Äù enough to not fall for the same bullshit twice.

But....like the hard right? They are more married to their ideology than reality and finding the truth.
[comment]All aspects of these allegations from Reade are very suspicious not the least of which is "Why now when he is the presumptive nominee?"
[comment]Fuck this.....we should be obsessed
[comment]Alternatively we could hold our politicians accountable. Yeah fox should have given legitimate coverage to trumps numerous accusers. That doesn‚Äôt mean we just sweep inconvenient things under the rug because our political opponents have no dignity.
[comment]Let‚Äôs put trump‚Äôs accusations on the board
Oh wait! His supporters don‚Äôt give a shit.
[comment]Man we can do better than this take.  This is cheesy af and we deserve to get blasted by the right for flipping so hard on women's issues.
[comment]They know he's a threat to defeat Trump[comment]Trump has already shown he is willing to cheat and break the law and fabricate non-stories to smear Biden. Why should we believe anything they ~~make~~ dig up on him?
[comment]Omg all of you fuckers are saying the exact same thing trump's supporters are saying about his accusers.
[comment]The goal of the Bernie Bros is to destroy Joe Biden. The goal of Fox is to attack the rest of the media and scream "double standard!" over and over again.

The Democrats had better wake up. The Republicans plan on campaigning on Alternate Reality where the Mueller Report exonerated Trump[comment]Maybe the dems should not have a picked a vulnerable candidate again.
[comment]Is that Putin love letter real?
[comment]as a democrat we should 100% take this just as seriously as the allegations against trump. You can't just pick and choose like this
[comment]OR... we could prove ourselves to NOT be hypocrites and hold Biden just as accountable as we did Trump.
[comment]The hypocrisy of the Democrats has turned me so far away from the party. It's so disappointing. The Democratic party has as much integrity as rock. 

You should all be ashamed.
[comment]Oh my god this is so embarrassing. It‚Äôs the exact reason why young people aren‚Äôt gonna turn out for Biden b/c we‚Äôve come to understand how hypocritical and stand-for-nothing Democrats are
[comment]I agree that there should be more focus on Trump's scandals too[comment]Meanwhile during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings...
[comment]Glad that Bill said this[comment]One case is one case too many. Why vote in a rapist when you have Bernie
[comment]‚ÄúBelieve all women until it‚Äôs not profitable‚Äù you guys are disgusting[comment]Why would we ignore these allegations?
[comment]I think we should vote on who Obama[comment]I bet he wished he had been more critical of the Russiagate stuff considering the new findings about the lack of evidence for "Russian meddling."
[comment]President pussygrabber is so far ahead of Biden in accusations...they should be  concerned the media will start comparing their appetites for grabbing lady parts...Biden was better and vice president for eight years...it didn't seem to bother him then....non issue

[comment]Holy FUCK finally a reporter calls his incompetence out to his face.
[comment]An embarrassment to this country. Total idiot
[comment]I clapped when I heard this question. Wasn't there[comment]Just for perspective
Just 3[comment]yeah that 60-70 number is not happening now

why couldn't he just have lied and said 100 or 120 at least[comment]Whew
[comment]Grading on a trump scale this was a coherent answer
[comment]Wow. He essentially said: ‚Äúat least I‚Äôm not responsible for 2.2 million deaths‚Äù
[comment]What ? Damn[comment]I mean listen I‚Äôm no trump supporter but what kind of question is that? I understand the incompetence of trump[comment]Fun fact[comment]Lame....
[comment]Jesus that‚Äôs a bold question.
[comment]It feels like he‚Äôs been coached since the shit show last week. 

Not that it helped.
[comment]40 countries have done more testing per capita than the US.
[comment]He takes no responsibility.
[comment]Nobody wants to talk about ventilators because 1) the situation evolves 2) tragically they are largely ineffective in improving outcomes

Hey as long as you‚Äôre a super genius why not invent a time machine and stop yourself from firing the pandemic task force.
[comment]Wait[comment]This question is unfair. How would Trump know? He dodged Vietnam.
[comment]That reporter is awesome.
[comment]I mean[comment]I'm actually genuinely surprised that he didn't resort to name-calling the reporter like he normally does...
[comment]What a shockingly dumb and arrogant question. You can certainly ask tough questions about this[comment]Classic dodge the question
[comment]The greatest con artist of all time is getting better and better...
[comment]What a delusional fuck he is
[comment]The CDC issued its first warning on Jan 8. 

Trump held campaign rallies on Jan 9
He golfed on Jan 18
The first time he admitted the coronavirus might be a problem was Mar 13.
[comment]I‚Äôm very surprised he didn‚Äôt call the person out for asking such a ‚Äúnasty‚Äù question üôÑüôÑ
[comment]No!
[comment]I‚Äôm convinced he was wearing an earpiece &amp; getting correction anytime he veered off-course. If you watched the whole presser[comment]WW1 had 53k combat deaths
675k died from the spanish flu.

Trump is not a good president nor does he seem like good person but the comparison between Vietnam combat deaths amd this pandemic is invalid.  It's not even apples and oranges comparison[comment]Even if Trump had tried to do anything[comment]This outbreak is his personal Vietnam.
[comment]I think a lot of us owe her a beer[comment]The COVID-19 deaths were not president Trump's fault. It's not his fault that there is a new[comment]I mean... is that really fair? This virus was going to hit no matter what and
But considering we are still below that very optimistic estimates of deaths[comment]The great [Olivia Nuzzi](https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi)[comment]I'm actually shocked that he didn't just yell at her for being "an awful reporter
This was one of the most coherent answers he's ever given[comment]I'm not even American and feeling angry[comment]yeah but[comment]How can he argue they are doing well through this when countries who acted properly have far less fatalities per capita?
[comment]Trump claimed STD's were His Vietnam.  His boys are among the least intelligent humans on earth and they have immense influence. Our military claims something but they don't remember.  Where did six trillion go...
Thank you for your service white supremacy.
[comment]No[comment]He didn't answer the question and he congratulated himself.
[comment]Such a liar
[comment]well he didn't answer the question and all he did was congratulate himself[comment]No one said 2.2 million people would die.  He is using the old word salad to lessen the blow
"Hey mom and dad[comment]If he had done what they did in California we would have 1/3 the cases and 1/5 the deaths.

And he knew and could have acted long before leadership in California did.
[comment]Absolutely not!  Vote Blue!
[comment]&gt;"So
That's not going to age well.
[comment]He's actively increasing the number of deaths. It's like him co-operating with the virus itself (or competing with it)...
[comment]"I think... I think... I think..." What you think doesn't fucking matter. Face the facts!
[comment]Humm was the 40k Americans allowed to return from China put into quarantine or
We‚Äôre they just allowed in so they could spread the virus ?
[comment]The problem is that he answers with such an avalanche of complete lies[comment]Trump should never have allowed anyone to return to the country from anywhere when this thing hit. We wouldn't be where we are at right now[comment]Oh man[comment]All the points about Trump's overall awfulness are true. He's a dangerous monster. That said[comment]And all the while Trump defenders will still eat up his shit.

[comment]The fact that he was elected in the first place still boggles the mind. I really did not think there were *that* many stupid Americans.
[comment]It's a truly
Whether x number of people die has nothing to do with any comparison to a high mortality event (such as a war); it has to do with the intrinsic nature of the death dealing event in conjunction with the competence of response. To put it in the general terms she uses about "a POTUS"

This guy sucks.
[comment]In the same six weeks
The US ranks near the bottom of western countries in per capita infections and per capita deaths  Without NYC metro
The reporter is either a total idiot or a Democrat operative hired to smear Trump with lurid nonsense..
[comment]I'm surprised that Trump can answer this in his normal voice and not being angry and call reporters 'fake news'. :D

[title]Reminder: Russian trolls are active on reddit to create division between Biden and Bernie[selftext]https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/mueller-report-internet-research-agency-detailed-2016[comment]I know some Bernie Bro‚Äôs who are not Russian Trolls but they are actively trying their best to destroy Biden. They‚Äôre doing the same thing they did four years ago where they are advocating writing Bernie on to their ballots.

They do more harm than the Russian trolls in my opinion.
[comment]I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Russian trolls or Bernie Bros[comment]Sandersforpresident has been extra toxic lately.
[comment]It's not just Russia btw. There are covert conservative funded propaganda campaigns as well.

&gt; Did the Russians actually do these things? Maybe. It‚Äôs not confirmed either way. The sourcing even today remains tied to the same people who‚Äôve lied about a thousand other things&gt;  
&gt; The United States&gt;  
&gt; The logic of Russiagate is now beyond absurd. Vladimir Putin&gt;  
&gt; That this is a dumb story is characteristic. The people pushing it don‚Äôt have any smart arguments left for remaining in power. Through decades of corporate giveaways[comment]Ummm...yea[comment]The Bernie subreddits are really full of Russians right now.
[comment]I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised[comment]While this is clearly what we expected from the start[comment]I would not be surprised if they are on reddit
I remember seeing loads of imgur posts that were lying about what was in wikileaks dumps (e.g. attributing quotes by Ben Carson to Democrats) and thought in retrospect they could be Russian[comment]Also the Chinese. Also the Republicans
[comment]reminder: joe biden's a shit candidate[comment]Perhaps it's also best to keep in mind that just because someone criticizes your candidate or their platform does not inherently mean it's some undercover conspiracy. It surely is happening
Political discussion is seldom pretty[comment]Yes[comment]I noticed it big time the last five days.  I informed the moderators of r/feminism they were being brigaded by trolls going after Biden with a common theme and they were so thankful for my input that they banned me.

Also
I implore you if you are a Bernie supporter[comment]This election won't be lost or won because of Russian trolls
You have to lean forward into this stuff[comment]Biden and his record has done a fine job of convincing me never to vote for him. And I've voted Dem my entire 20-year voting history.

I bit my tongue and voted Hillary in 2016
Biden is showing no leadership right now
It is clear who the next president should be
So you can either lose with Biden or win with Bernie. It's your choice.
[comment]Itstead of just being the town crier let‚Äôs get some posts with what our counter measures are to be. Please.
[comment]What's really shitty about this is we have to have rely on the Mueller report for information about this. That was released a year ago and against the objections of the president. We should have the FBI releasing regular reports on these misinformation campaigns. We need a president who will take our national security seriously.

[comment]Biden kinda sucks though.
[comment]You know I just thought of one thing. If we have to go to vote by mail for the November election it might actually stop the Russians from hacking the voting machines and handing Trump another election. The counting machines likely won't have anything to do with the vulnerable electronic machines.

[comment]Bernie supporter here...nothing pisses me off more than how aggressive Biden supporters have been on this subreddit. Just when I think eh whatever i'll vote Biden I see this shit and the comments and think how much do you have to blame other countries to hide their same old status-quo agenda's? You want the Bernie voters to come you will need to get your heads out of Biden's ass and push him to compromise with progressives more. FACT.    

SideNote: Remember Bernie supporters are mostly 30 and younger we know the difference between fake news unlike Biden supporters...
[comment]You should repost this every day from now until the election to remind us.
[comment]That may well be. But with news about Biden sexually assaulting his staff person...if I have to choose between Trump and Biden I'll stay home. There may be people who are causing issues on purpose[comment]The real problem is that it makes you question authentic sentiment. 

There are plenty of people who like Bernie and don‚Äôt like Biden

[title]Until my dying day I will never understand why Hillary Clinton‚Äôs existence causes so many people‚Äôs brains to melt into pudding. It‚Äôs just baffling on every level and anytime anyone tries to explain why they hate her so much they sound like raving fucking lunatics.

It takes a special kind of person to listen to 30 year so that and not turn off. 

The kind of person that needs an enemy. The kind of person that needs to hate.
[comment]A highly successful GOP psyop started in 1990.
[comment]In 2016 I was all aboard the Bernie train. During the primaries I ingested all the anti-Hillary flak. A lot of it was petty stuff and of course there was the obvious BS like Benghazi and her emails
Disclaimer: When it came down to her vs Trump I sprinted to my polling place to vote for her over him. I'm not a moron.
[comment]Clearly these people just needed a tiny push[comment]Misogyny. Contempt for women is a National past time.
[comment]Really though they voted for and continue to support Trump.
[comment]It started with her work on Watergate.  Then[comment]Her support of Bill‚Äôs ‚Äòtough on crime‚Äô stance is just one of many examples that she was rightly criticised by the left for co-opting populist reputation policies. It‚Äôs hard to argue that she wasn‚Äôt just a shell without principles that would say or do whatever it took to get elected.
[comment]Hey
He's a 2020 Trump supporter now and writes articles about how Sanders supporters should switch to Trump.

Imagine that.
[comment]I like her well enough as a human being. But her voice could sometimes be a bit unpleasant.
[comment]I remember back in the '16 cycle someone had a tweet simmering to the effect of "if you have an issue with voting for Hillary over Trump[comment]She‚Äôs got a better kdr then me for one
[comment]I used to just chalk it to straight misogyny[comment]Because Dems don't think for themselves[comment]Bernie will win. He doesnt have an expiration date. 

This country is a goddamn nightmare[comment]Maybe you should learn something from Hillary's complete inability to inspire change. 

Like if I'm being honest I think the democratic party really hates having complete power because that means they have to deliver to their voters while pretending to protect capital and the rich assholes who own the party. 

America NEVER had a labor party. We NEVER had a voice for working people. We have a half assed corporate monstrosity that sells us a dream and then hands it to the republicans every fucking 8 years. And yes that includes Obama.

I hate this whole system i want it completely burnt to the ground.
[comment]It all begins with the Nytimes and William Fucking Safire.

[comment]I think it‚Äôs the fake blonde hair; makes her look dishonest.

[comment]I felt like I decently liked Hillary since she‚Äôs a wonkyBut I‚Äôve been disappointed in her behavior post 2016 election.
[comment]I mean I admit I don‚Äôt like her politics but I did support her over Donald and the level of hate it goes to for a lot of people is... something else.
[comment]Because the Clinton's are evil[comment]Australia had the same with its Democratic equivalent party[comment]I don't hate her. I hate her neoliberal policies[comment]I think a lot of Democrats (including myself) are a bit salty about the perceived wrong doing in the 2016 primaries re: Bernie. I think the Republicans simply drank the Fox kool-aid. In any case she'd be a better candidate that Trump by miles[comment]My biggest problem with Hillary running for president was that she is the spouse of a past president. I didn't like Bush jr for the same reason. We should be discouraging such type of relationships and a single family holding such a prominent office for multiple terms. I did vote for her over Trump but ideologically i hated myself for it.

In 1975Hilary Clinton defended her rapistFollowing this[comment]To act like there‚Äôs no reason to dislike her is dishonest. 

It is disproportional to Trump though. The right usually shouts Benghazi whenever asked for a reason to hate her
Having said that[comment]I‚Äôm a Dem[comment]Faux News
[comment]She encompasses everything that is wrong with this neoliberal ideology. She sees foreign policy as a chess board where everything is about countering Russia. Never on the side of anti-intervention or stopping regime change wars. Still blames her loss on Russian intervention instead of her not campaigning in the rust belt. Stole the election for Bernie 

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

She was the definition of an establishment candidate. And people are sick and tired of the status quo

This is the same shit as everyone freaking out because Kamala Harris dropped out. Blaming it on racism and sexism rather than her being a terrible candidate. She did not prosecute Steve Mnuchin for financial crimes because he was a big democratic donor.
 https://theintercept.com/2017/01/05/kamala-harris-fails-to-explain-why-she-didnt-prosecute-steven-mnuchins-bank/

[comment]I like this response the most.

&gt;Women who seek political power are a threat to patriarchy. White women who are aware of their privilege and can effectively articulate it are a threat to white supremacy. Hillary Clinton did both so some people were really upset[comment]I always assumed it started in Bill‚Äôs presidency. She tried to push through a number of things (like health care reform - damn her! /s) and refusing to stay in her lane.

The biggest issue with what they did to Hillary isn't that they endlessly attacked her... it's that the Democratic base abandoned  her by starting to believe at least some of the various attacks they've done on her.

[comment]If Hillary doesn‚Äôt want the hate[comment]Here are two facts; one which Democrats can't accept
* Hillary was the target of the conservative brainwashing machine. They hate her because (knowing she was the next primary candidate for the presidency)  the Right spent years demonizing her in a never-ending faux news cycle of hate.
* Hillary would have made a mediocre president. She's too close to corporate money to actually have represented We The People.

An observation:  In a (perhaps sick) philosophical sense[comment]It's been over 3 years. Time to get over it?
[comment]I don't hate her
What I do find deeply disturbing is that the right-wing machine that exists to paint her as the 'antichrist' has mostly succeeded in regards to people who already disliked her.

[title]Megathread for tonight's Biden/Sanders Democratic Debate
[selftext]**We invite you to discuss tonight's Democratic Debate between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders beginning at 8:00 EST and 5:00 PST. Please be respectful and stick to the issues.**


--------------


**The debate will air exclusively on CNN[comment]Biden and Bernie really need some sun--both look so pale!!     I hope they attack Trump instead of each other.      Bernie personally comes off as a better "debater" and makes fewer mistakes especially on healthcare.
[comment]Honestly[comment]Answer the question Bernie. What would you do **now.**
[comment]Biden is taking the ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù approach with saying everything in regards to COVID-19 would be free. Bernie is trying to get the point across that his plan for M4A would provide a better foundation or defense[comment]Biden is steady like he‚Äôs ready to take the role.


All this smearing of his brain power is going to be blown away tonight.
[comment]Bernie keeps talking our healthcare system and how it should be changed in the future. That does not address the crisis. We need to address what to do today.
[comment]It's not Ebola[comment]I'm finding Biden's behavior really awkward.
[comment]Did Biden just credit himself for stopping a great depression?
[comment]How do we feel about immigrants also getting healthcare?  I would normally say no but seems crucial in times like these
[comment]Bernie doing one of his rants instead of answering Joe's questions about how to pay for it.
[comment]Wait did Joe Biden just straight up lie twice??üò¨üò¨üò¨
[comment]‚ÄúI still won!‚Äù
[comment]I expected this debate to be focused primarily on the coronavirus
[comment]Biden is getting hammered.
[comment]Imagine a Biden-Sanders ticket though.  If Biden were to offer and Bernie were to accept[comment]So Bernie has decided to just lie and take everything back to his stump speech
Leadership sometimes requires working with reality[comment]I never thought I would say this[comment]Bernie out there blazin Joe up
[comment]Neither one of these clowns have a prayer in hell of beating Trump. with their policies your taxes will be through the roof and gas prices will be $4-5  a gallon.
[comment]Biden has answered every question in a numbered list format
[comment]So they asked Bernie why his message isn‚Äôt resonating with African Americans and he talks about turning out young and latino vote?

Given an opportunity to speak directly to us and this marg has NOTHING to say?
[comment]Every time Biden starts with "Number 1" I worry he's going to get lost on his rambling track to the next Number 1" story...
[comment]Where can I find a recorded version of it in Canada? I just happened to have missed it.
[comment]Biden did not try to bring progressives into the fold tonight. He lied about his past record and gave no solutions to what progressives care about. Bernie did not help himself either tonight. He needed to come at Biden way harder than he did. Biden gave one word answers
One last thing. The whole "how will you deal with the Coronavirus?" question is pretty pointless when you CANT do anything now at this moment if you ARE NOT the current president. It was a pointless question and won't be a concern once either candidate gain the office.
[comment][interesting fact checks](https://www.wkyc.com/mobile/article/news/verify/verify-fact-checking-the-11th-democratic-debate/95-394b8c45-40ac-4f66-8c21-d83e3641b177)

South Korea ALSO has a single payer health system. They[comment]Biden is a lying sack of shit. 


Let him go the whole way and I‚Äôll vote trump again.
[comment]1. Number one
2. Number one
3. First thing we got to do
4. Situation Room
5. Those 2 things
[comment]This more a thread about the moderators opinions than actually debating the debate.  Who is this guy?
[comment]Biden has allegedly lost thousands of voters after being caught put lying during debate.

https://youtu.be/nZ2WOT455MA
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter and I realize Biden is going to win.

But God damn is he doing a piss poor job of trying to pivot and unify the party no matter how you think he did at the debate.

Hillary didn't give a damn about trying to unify and it helped tank her.  Biden needs to stop bad mouthing M4A.  Say you don't think it could pass
This is going to be 2016 all over again till team Biden takes one of the like 10 olive branches Sanders was offering in that softball debate and actually works with the left to unify.  He can't just take it for granted like Clinton did.
[comment]Damn it's pretty crazy how many times Biden lied about easily provable facts about his record.  You guys think he's gonna do anything to reach out to Bernie's support base<|startoftext|>

Why are you all acting like sexist[comment]She‚Äôs nuts
[comment]Any standard should eliminate that Russian stooge from the debate stage. This shouldn't be anything surprising. She's been polling dead last for a while now. Time to take your ill gotten gains and your Kremlin backed ass out of there Tulsi.

[selftext]https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/us-election-2020-trump-joe-biden-economy-policies-republicans-democrats-a9537786.html[comment]Republicans need to be decimated as a political party.
[comment]They had three and a half years to do something about him.  They didn't.  Instead[comment]If only they had a chance to remove him....
[comment]Wouldn't it be funny if Hillary just ran against him again?

She‚Äôd only need one campaign slogan:

‚ÄúAre you better off today than you were four years ago?‚Äù
[comment]As long as people VOTE he will!
[comment]That's what the GOP thought during the 2016 election as well after the pussygrab video came out. But the deplorables just stuck with Trump's scam. I fear the bar has been lowered way down into hell this time around.
[comment]‚ÄúIf we nominate Trump[comment]They should have thought of that in February when they covered for him.
[comment]Well they're certainly not acting like it.
[comment]Biden doesn‚Äôt have a chance
[comment]What I cant understand is this hill they are dying on.  They could right now


Because they're going to cheat.
[comment]Ah yes[comment]Let just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange f√ºher from office. Common America it‚Äôs time üá∫üá∏
[comment]I mostly see posts that republicans are worried about an impending Biden landslide on democrat subs. This news while uplifting can unconsciously demotivate us to vote because ‚Äòit‚Äôs in the bag‚Äô so to speak.   I don‚Äôt know why we believe anything republicans say and truly
OP no disrespect
Downvote me to hades[comment]Landslide? Joe is damaging his campaign every time he opens his mouth. How is he going to debate when Freudian slips keep happening when cameras are on him?
[comment]Trump cultists haven‚Äôt budged. They love Trump even more now that he‚Äôs killed people with his lies and misinformation. They think he‚Äôs a hero and they‚Äôre ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù saving the economy from democRATs. Vote. Vote. For the love of God vote!
[comment]As a moderate[comment]Huh funny[comment]Just Vote.
[comment]Good.
[comment]tRump üòÜ is killing himself because he's sooo stupid üòÇ
[comment]They should just forfeit the whole fucking thing and save everyone the time and money.
[comment]Biden looks boss af in that pic. That‚Äôs a commander in Chief!
[comment]Niggers
[comment]They can always send another candidate if they want.
[comment]The "good" news here is the ignorant orange asshole is incapable of changing his strategy. He is convinced he is infallible so it has to be right.
[comment]If we had more democracy and everyone voted all that would happen is the GOP would have to adopt some more popular positions. The horror!
[comment]All Biden hast to do is not interrupt Trump while he‚Äôs beating himself
[comment]It needs to be a landslide loss to make it harder for Trump to cheat and steal.
[comment]How about just saying F politics
[comment]Well....well they should be. Mabe it will help them with that self-reflection stuff. I hope anyway.
[comment]They had their chance to get rid of him.
[comment]Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs another shit show of choices....Guess I have to vote for the hair smelling rapist over the racist murderer smh
[comment]Doesn't matter what anyone says or thinks. VOTE. VOTE like your VOTE will be the deciding VOTE. And don't only VOTE in major elections. VOTE in all your local elections too. Your county website should have all the info. If you can't find it[comment]As rosy as the situation is now<|startoftext|>
[title]10% of Trump 2016 voters might not vote for him in 2020 ‚Äî The persuadable Trump voter could swing the election in November.
[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21173431/swing-voters-trump-2020[comment]I refuse to believe this until I see it.

Remember when 25% of Republicans were expected to stay home in 2016 because they thought Trump was so disgusting? Their embarrassment to publicly admit they want to vote for Trump doesn't make their vote for Trump disappear.
[comment]Encouraging but I‚Äôm not gonna count on it
[comment]After reading through the numbers it is estimated that 5-9% of Bernie supporters voted for Trump. Some of those will again.
[comment]I'm one of those switchers.

I did a lot of maturing between 2016 and 2020.
[comment]¬£¬£
[comment]Given the age demographics of Republicans I would be surprised if 10% of Trump 2016 voters haven't died.
[comment]I would hope we could swing the election without them and they only matter in 3 states as we won the popular vote by over 3 million. The popular vote does not matter in our broken constitution with the electoral college compromise.
[comment]I never met a wishy-washy republican.
[comment]This presidential election is all about bringing out the base. The level of polarization the US electorate makes it unlikely to change anyone's mind about which team they support. Whoever does a better job bringing out their people to vote wins.
[comment]Great let's do m4a
[comment]We can only hope they find their way back.
[comment]50 percent of clintons voters may discover Joe to be more off-putting. So how will that balance out?
[comment]Well
But whoever wins the primary I am campaigning for.
[comment]Oh great! We are counting on a bunch of spoiled selfish conspiracy theorists to win the day. What could possibly go wrong?
[comment]Former Trump voter here
First
Anyway[comment]He has a 92% approval rate among the voters and this Party is shitting on Sanders supporters.
[comment]I made a mistake in 2016 and voted for trump[comment]They may catch windmill cancer too if they aren‚Äôt careful.
[comment]Surprised its only 10%.
[comment]Could this be true?
[comment]What the article doesn't discuss is where these potential vote flippers are located.   If they tend to be in blue states anyway[comment]Seems like wishful thinking. My question is how many Democrats (especially young people) are gonna be put off by a candidate who is anti abortion
America just isn't ready.
[comment]Biden is gonna get destroyed in those coming debates. Do we believe that Biden will travel the country doing rally‚Äôs? It‚Äôs gonna be ugly[comment]I was willing to vote for pretty much anyone but Biden. The Democratic Party is on the verge of selecting the one candidate I would vote for Trump over. So count me out of that "10%".
[comment]Good. I don't want more Trump.
[comment]They would have voted for Bernie. They resented Obama‚Äôs turn against his 08 progressive politics. They got suckerd by trumps false populism. They won‚Äôt vote for an Obama era guy that suckerd them once already.
[comment]The victory lies with the swing/independent voters. Been saying it for two years. Motivate your friends to register and vote at Vote.gov
[comment]Don‚Äôt forget Putin.. he wants the puppet.. he‚Äôll cheat for the win.
[comment]Trump is going to win again because our party just has no fucking clue how to unify.

Go on r/SandersForPresident \-- you'll find a huge number of people who will never vote for a democrat if Sanders loses.  

Republicans
Us[comment]Trump voters want an anti-establishment candidate. That candidate may be Trump and it may be Sanders[comment]that sounds about right. in the end[comment]If sanders doesnt make it im staying home[comment]So we need to go with a candidate that will pull those voters then.
[comment]Only 10%. People are so willfully ignorant.
[comment]That's okay[comment]&gt; "... The persuadable Trump voter ..."

* you mean any Jethro with a double digit IQ?

No doubt even his most idiot Russian shill bot backers are getting tired of shooting themselves in the foot and voting against their own interest.

And I don't want to hear shit about those morons wanting to "get sucked up to heaven"<|startoftext|>
[title]Michelle Obama Is Mad at Black Voters[selftext]https://www.thedailybeast.com/netflixs-becoming-shows-michelle-obama-is-mad-at-black-voters-not-trump-voters[comment]She is awesome. I wish she would be our veep because she would make a fantastic president.
[comment]I'm mad at everyone who didn't vote for Hillary in 2016 too[comment]Uhgg.  Couldn't agree more.  Not only in 2016 but especially 2010.  First black president and black voters couldn't even be bothered to show up in 2010 and let the Tea Party take over.    The Dem party shoots itself in the foot a lot.
[comment]Imagine being a political party where you get angry at a certain race for voting a certain way or not living their lives how you decided they should live their lives. Almost sounds like this party is ‚ÄúUsing‚Äù black people. What a shame.
[comment]What the hell is this shit? For one[comment]Call me crazy but I think people should WANT to vote for you[comment]You should blame the candidate not the voters. If you can‚Äôt get people to vote for you[comment]I feel the point she was making was more around[comment]Let‚Äôs be real. Black people dont vote. Even if Kanye was running for president they won‚Äôt go out of their way to vote. I‚Äôm Asian and even I know Asian people won‚Äôt vote if it‚Äôs Andrew Yang
[comment]It is the citizen's responsibility to exercise their franchise. If you don't vote[comment]Maybe if they nominated a candidate people actually wanted to vote for this wouldn't be a problem
[comment]44% of eligible voters didn't vote in 2016. Thats about average for every presidential election[comment]Michelle assumed an entire segment of society that shares the burden of (sometimes) hidden discrimination would understand that only a Democrat would protect Obama's legacy.  Trump made it very clear he was anti-Obama and would destroy any legacy left over. John Boehner and Mitch McConnell had made every piece of legislation Obama tried to pass an absolute ordeal. Michele is nothing if not loyal and she saw what her husband went through.  Maybe she assumed everyone would see as clearly.
[comment]Mad because Black voters either A didn‚Äôt want to vote for Hillary or B[comment]Trump voters have serious mental issues and don‚Äôt know any better.
[comment]2016 was tied for 2nd-highest turnout in the last 50 years. Tied with 2004[comment]Or Democrats could try nominating someone who‚Äôs not had 30 years of baggage and right wing vitriol thrown at them
But no[comment]She knows she never had sway with those people.
[comment]You can‚Äôt make voters turn out for an uncharismatic candidate.

We‚Äôre about to find out this same thing we already knew in this election. The only way Joe Biden will win is if Trump somehow makes a fool out of himself to his own supporters[comment]All these people blaming others for the losses. Look to yourself! Did you phone bank? Did the Democrats do enough to reach out to would be voters? The fault is with you not those uninspired to vote for a candidate that failed to create enthusiasm.
[comment]Its about people NOT voting. Not people who voted  for so n so.
[comment]Because she knows how evil the Clinton's were to black people and that's why they didn't vote for her. Michelle Obama is Privileged AF and needs to wake up to this. She should've endorsed Bernie.
[comment]Even her enemies admit that Hillary is a great administrator. And it's time we all admit that Hillary's predictions have been right on the money. None of these problems would be happening if Hillary was President. And the Obama economy would still be chugging along and 70
Of course[comment]Thank üëè You üëè Michelle üëè

I've seen the numbers and the amount of black voters that did not vote is exactly why Trump won.
[comment]NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. 

Hillary‚Äôs campaign was warned numerous times that something bad was happening in the rust belt and they ignored it every time. If they had pushed for turnout in Pennsylvania

[comment]It's a right to vote Michelle there are choices
[comment]Why TF are dems still perplexed as to why people didn't come out to vote for the worst democratic candidate of most voters' lifetimes? Of course nobody came out to vote for Hillary[comment]I have said this multiple times and pissed off many friends: However dumb you think Trump voters are
For me it is just in super simple math terms. Whether you voted Trump or Clinton
Not voting is the equivalent of saying ‚ÄúI cannot tell you if -10 is greater than -1000[comment]Being betrayed by a friend is much worse than being betrayed by an enemy.
[comment]You want politicians to listen to you and pander to you?  Vote!  Doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt like either of them this time. 

First of all stop voting for the charismatic guy. Vote for the smartest guy. Stop voting for ‚Äúslick‚Äù Good on TV assholes.  You don‚Äôt have to work with him
But back to my main point. The next election<|startoftext|>
[title]Joe Biden: "I'll say what Donald Trump won't: The Confederate flag[selftext]https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1256306743585370112[comment]Damn. See how easy that was?
[comment]Trump shirked responsibility again[comment]Not to mention Nazi flags Âçê ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
[comment]Leadership.
[comment]Too bad they're all forms of speech and therefore protected under the first amendment to the Constitution.   

Not that Dems care about that old piece of paper once they're offended or scared...
[comment]Lol. Joe Biden didn't say that. His side maybe wrote that. There is no way that guy could formulate a coherent thought such as this good try. I would like to even see Joe Biden read that on camera without fuxking it up.
[comment]Regardless of ones feelings. I myself care not for the Confederate Flag or Swastikas. However[comment]Fuck Trump and his eighth grade drop out followers.
[comment]It's "funny" how these kind of protests always involve confederate flags and nazi symbols no matter what the purported aim of the protest is.
[comment]Wish his spoken sentences were as coherent
[comment]Sigh. Yeah this dude is way better than the Devil himself
[comment]I think it's funny that one of my favorite genres of music is southern rock[comment]Will he also say that all Americans should have access to free healthcare?

Probably not.

Why get the whole sandwich when you can get the crumbs?
[comment]Biden is actually racist though. Why wouldn't the democrat party want to get rid of him instead of letting him infect the party and ruin public perception of the party?
[comment]I love it[comment]About time he got a voice-SPEAK UP FOR JOE
[comment]Hey mod who deleted my comment. Am I wrong?

[comment]He didn't "say" this he tweeted it.
[comment]Just a heads up
I only mention it because of the Republicans victim-card-spidy-senses get all tingly when you bring up swastikas. Its a perfect opportunity for them to do what they do[comment]Let's start a task force[comment]Does anyone actually believe Biden said that?

[comment]Fuck Trump

# Trumpvirus

# Trumpknew
[comment]Lol....mmmkay
[comment]He did call it a hoax
https://youtu.be/G5TZ6fTYrsE
[comment]Alleging??  If we can‚Äôt even state the black and white truth without weasel words
He will win in November[comment]Lordy I hope there's tapes!
[comment]LOL. Dude DID call it a hoax. Fucking moron. Where is Lee Harvey Oswald when we need him most?
[comment]Fuck Trump
[comment]&gt;alleging

you mean demonstrating?
[comment]This president is a whiney little bitch.
[comment]Sued for what? Truthtelling?
[comment]He always threatens legal action[comment]What a loser this man is.
[comment]He threatens to sue people all the time. So what?
[comment]We need him to take his own Petersen House trip. That's a sentence I never thought I would say[comment]Okay... lets assume he didn't call it a hoax for sake of argument.

Lets put the same legal action on any station that puts his lies on the air.
[comment]OMG! This is so cute! This thing has already gone viral on social media. LOL
[comment]Let him sue[comment]Someone needs to figure out a dumbed down explanation of the Streisand effect to present to him.
[comment]He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.

He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.
[comment]Trump is a hoax. Period.
[comment]I say they should go right ahead. I would love to see that hit the courts. There was a little lawsuit called Citizens' United that we all remember.
[comment]Well[comment]All the caterwauling about the 2nd amendment[comment]But he did.
[comment]\#thetrumpvirus
[comment]When you don't have a leg to stand on[comment]Discovery. Simple. Trump is using legal action as a form of intimidation. It‚Äôs the Devin Nunes playbook.
[comment]So[comment]I love how he just calls everything that even remotely threatens his position of power a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù.
[comment]Priorities USA should counter with ‚Äúwe‚Äôll cover all your legal fees if you are sued by the Trump campaign‚Äù.
[comment]SLAPP suits 101[comment]Hey Trump lemme just pull out the world's smallest violin real quick.
[comment]..... he did though
[comment]Please find the audio of him actually saying the virus itself is a hoax.  There is your answer to this headline.
[comment]I swear if they cave under this bullshit threat then they're part of the damn problem. *Everyone* gives in to him. Everyone backs down. 

Paste this link all over the damn internet folks.

https://youtu.be/G5TZ6fTYrsE

And let's be clear here. Fact-checkers
&gt;‚ÄúCoronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it.  We did one of the great jobs. You say
You tell me. *What* exactly is he calling a hoax? The claim he's not doing anything? Because the rest of the ad has all the quotes you need proving *that* interpretation too.

This is bullshit and we have got to stop taking it. If fact-checkers and journalists aren't going to[comment]But he did[comment]How the hell can reality be unfair to Donald j drumpf or any like-minded person when he/they think the alternate reality that they believe in is actual reality.
[comment]Let em sue then use that against them too
[comment]Sure thing
BTW trump is famous for his past bullshit threats of legal action.
[comment]It's plainly established precedent. In the US truth is an absolute defense to libel or slander.

Let him file the suit and lose[comment]So what? Let em let him sue. Roll the tape!
[comment]This is one of those times where you should‚Äôve been more open minded and diplomatic Don. I think those excepts fall under fair use. Not much can be done to stop it from happening.
[comment]Yeah but he did! Like it's crazy that they deny he says stuff that is on video with those words coming out of his mouth. I've heard this before. Yeah he said the "corona virus[comment]‚ÄúThis is their new hoax.‚Äù
-Donald Trump
[comment]How dare they broadcast factual information! Damn liberal media.
[comment]Trump was tweeting some of the meanest crap against Obama when he was fighting a pandemic just for attention and his agenda. If you can't stand the heat[comment]God he is stupid!
[comment]What is this word[comment]The networks need too have some courage for once and keep running the ad. They would have no chance in court with this[comment]Calling Michael Bloomberg - he could nullify this scare tactic in a second by pledging protection for entities threatented by the dictator's campaign.
[comment]HAHAHHAHAHAH
[comment]But those words left his mouth[comment]Last election[comment]He did[comment]The caption to this post uses the term "alleging". WTF? There is no alleging. It's on video.
[comment]Sooo...let him sue?  because he doesn't have a case??  

This is the authoritarian answer yo everything here in the US.  Sue and bankrupt everyone that farts in the wrong direction.  Devin Nunez pulled that shit too.

Let them bankrupt themselves.
[comment]That will be an amazingly easy lawsuit for the TV stations and add creator to win considering he's on tape several times calling it a hoax and a democratic hoax!
[comment]It‚Äôs just a tactic to either get it taken down or neuter it by turning it into a ‚Äúhe said[comment]What is the basis for the legal action?
[comment]Every anti trump ad should just play his lies along with a graphic or video of the actual truth. Every word out of his stinking face hole is a lie so there should be mountains of material to work with.
[comment]But he did say that. It's not defamation if it's the truth. He said it. We have him on video saying it.
[comment]Alleging?

He actually did.
[comment]Does anyone have a link to the ad?
[comment]&gt; However  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúCoronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it
&amp;#x200B;

They could edit the ad and take the hoax part out.  It is still damaging without it given all the other crap he said about it being under control.
[comment]He actually ranted that democrats were criticizing the response and that criticism was purely political and a hoax.  The criticism was dead on!

We should run with this
I'd love to see somebody do an ad or video that shows Dem politicians saying what he should have been doing or was he did wrong and then show his rant over the increasing number of cases.

&gt;**Now  the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that[comment]LMFAO at the cheeto dusted bloviator

[title]Biden Now Leads With Most Senior Demographics ‚Äî Older Americans' Support for Trump Has Collapsed ‚Äî "Let Grandma Die" Proves Unpopular With Grandma
[selftext]https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-older-voters-turning-away-from-trump/[comment]65-75 are considered the most reliable age group to vote. And the most susceptible age group to life-ending coronavirus.

We need to start pushing vote-by-mail as our national standard during a global pandemic. Just in case that second wave hits about that time.
[comment]Boomers only care when it impacts them
[comment]Biden is more popular than Hillary Clinton. I hope it‚Äôs enough to make a difference.
[comment]Ya[comment]Except my grandma... and aunts and parents. I can't make them see the reality of the situation that has been entirely trump's fault.
[comment]ive never voted for a republican and ive lived a long time
[comment]Don't worry. They'll find something for Grandma to be scared of more than them[comment]Love it. If grannies mad at the orange turd[comment]Maybe it‚Äôs because Biden seems older so he‚Äôs more relatable
[comment]Let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôs only our entire democracy that‚Äôs on the line after all
[comment]And us the youth who will have to live with this new world after this blows over in a couple YEARS wanted Bernie the one time that the youth the least reliable age group came out in force Biden shows the fuck up and splits the fucking vote. If he loses it‚Äôs fucking over.
[comment]Republicans have always gotten 0% support with this grandpa.
[comment]I'm not sure why but polls don't pick up on the voting preferences of certain lower income republicans. We should ignore all these polls.

[comment]Well we‚Äôre screwed then because I live ( minutes from Iowa[comment]Trump's gambit was that most of the casualties would be in the cities and that they would die in time for election day. We have to be careful and actively prevent that from paying off for him.
[comment]This feels so off[comment]I'll believe it when I see it. Old people have spent the last 40 years believing literally every conspiracy theory that has ever been thought of no matter how inane. All it'll take is one email blast about how Biden is working with the U.N. to put Christians into reeducation camps or some shit. Then grandma will go running back to the GOP.

We must stop whining and outvote the old. Tweets aren't votes. Posts on Reddit aren't votes.

Bernie supporters need to chin up and realize that we‚Äôre not just fighting for the presidency[comment]Glad to see Democrats coming together after a hard fought primary. We may have disagreed on certain issues[comment]I'd vote for one of Biden's turds over Trump
[comment]Everybody still needs to vote for Sanders to maximize his delegate count and power to influence the Democratic party and turn it into something that people can actually get excited to vote for.
[comment]What would you like?  4 years of potential mediocrity with Biden or 4 MORE years of the circus we have right now?  We need to band together folks[comment]Ok Biden supporters[comment]Sanders should be vice president. Just for the simple fact that he has so many behind him.

[title]Mask and all[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/opinions/biden-mask-trump-ghitis/index.html[comment]At this point[comment]The stars aligned for Biden. He is an awful speaker and now all he has to do is put a mask on and let Trump tweet to look presidential.

Trump is going to go out spectacularly[comment]Okay[comment]Don't buy into this narrative. Consider that Trump and his supporters are the exact kind of people who would deliberately LIE to the pollsters just to see false information spread out there.
[comment]The only power we have is to withhold our vote until he takes serious action on climate crisis and Medicare for All.
[comment]You're right! we shouldn't ask for anything from politicians five months before an election!
[comment]No. Organizing and asking for reasonable[comment]Great. Two disgusting old rich white men. 

Again.
[comment]Sorry Biden is going to lose without the left this time unless he moves on Medicare for All and Climate Crisis. All my leftist friends are going to sit this out.
[comment]Trump and his cult can spew whatever bullshit they can but between the RayBans and the black mask Biden looks presidential.
[comment]I'm voting a straight Blue ticket and for any candidate that runs against Trump. 

Not voting in this critical election is not a protest[comment]Currently masks are worn ONLY to stop the spread of Covid-19 not preventing the wearer from getting the virus. I understand both perspectives on this[comment]Not just vote. vote for every Democratic candidate you can in every election everywhere. Anyone in the party that supports trump is morally bankrupt.
[comment]Ninja ~~Gaiden~~ Biden
[comment]Lets run up the score and humiliate Trump. We need to vote in numbers never seen before.  Destroy Trump's brand.

[comment]And Bernie's base has a duty to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
[comment]This is what can turn people away from voting Democrat . Basically says that you should only vote for someone because they have a high chance of beating that other guy not because they agree with him.
[comment]I would vote for Bernie if he gets the nom but I think this article is bunk. The real danger here is that Bernie getting the nom would likely send Wall Street into a frenzy. They have already been trying to stave off an overdue recession<|startoftext|>

[comment]Time to dust off that 2nd amendment and take a stand against tyranny. 

Sadly[comment]Probably no coincidence this was released the same day it was exposed that Yale and Harvard have been hiding foreign money.
[comment]I started r/TheNonsilentMajority after reading this. 

I think there's a space for anyone who has an issue with the escalation of power in the Executive Branch[comment]I really don‚Äôt think it will be close at all. Dems might even win Georgia and Arizona maybe Texas too

[comment]Exactly
[comment]Marsha Blackburn and other ‚ÄúR‚Äù friends are currently blocking bills from being passed that tighten election security.
It‚Äôs obviously working out for them.

[comment]The dumbasses do realize that by removing him from office he may also be arrested and no longer a threat right?
[comment]Fear *and* greed. Not necessarily in that order.
[comment]Trump has probably spent his morning planning on revenge on Romney.
[comment]So the Republican strategy is that they think it looks better to be in fear of the president than to be a sycophantic bootlicker. Well[comment]Typical of tyrannical regimes. Hitler's sycophantic hangers-on were afraid to wake him up to let him know the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy. Same for Stalin when the Nazis had crossed their Western border on the road to Moscow.

The end is near.
[comment]Simply put:

I hope it haunts them for the rest of their lives if he starts doing things that can no longer be excused. Things that actually keep them up at night. Arguably he already is
People dying. Different parts of the government collapsing. The United States itself falling into disrepair. That's all on them.

They knew exactly what sort of shit Trump would immediately do if they let him off the hook for this[comment]I look forward to seeing the reactions when he turns on his party.
[comment]They all have partaken of russian money
[comment]makes no sense. If they convicted and removed him[comment]Makes what Romney did all the more impressive.
[comment]That's why republicns do everything: they are afraid of everything all the time

[comment]Cowards! We're led by cowards.
[comment]No they didn‚Äôt[comment]Marco Rubio literally said Trumps actions meet the bar for impeachment and then says he he won‚Äôt impeach because this is partisan. Not voting what you believe is what is making it partisan.
[comment]Spineless cowards who piss on the constitution because they are afraid of his voters.

[comment]Shit ton of money helps with that.

No retaliation danger.

[comment]You know guys
the House rushed impeachment. They needed to build up the evidence for PR purposes. If you compare how Nixon was removed with how this House moved forward... it‚Äôs like night and day... in 1974 the House voted 410-4 to begin an impeachment inquiry. That‚Äôs not a typo: 410-4!!!!    

US District Court
That‚Äôs what it takes to remove a President and I think we rushed it in case. I just hope it does not backfire.
[comment]What if Trump actually literally goes mad?  He seems sometimes to be on the verge.  And now he's enraged after the impeachment and the Rush Limbaugh scandal[comment]They‚Äôll be too afraid to do anything when Trump decides he‚Äôs going to make himself president for life. Seriously people[comment]Fake news

It turns out the Trump fired the CDC expert on China as well as the pandemic response team.
[comment]This wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Bernie Sanders had been nominated
Go figure!
[comment]Any other functional adult would have handled this better
[comment]Hillary did win[comment]Besides general incompetence and leadership failures on trumps part this country would be ducked regardless maybe to a slightly lesser degree with anyone else in charge.  No sick leave[comment]Maybe we could talk about people who are currently involved in the democratic party and our politics? like i get it
What we need right now is the party to start asking themselves why we're not hearing anything out of Biden right now. Sanders is out there raising money and organizing and Joe is "working 4-5 hrs a day" and "reading memos" 

I'd really like to hear a lot more from him right now[comment]oh hell no this wouldn't have happened if she won but if it did happen it would be nothing like this because she's not a stupid mother fucker[comment]It would have happened. Maybe the response would be different. But the virus would have happened either way. 

It's delusional to believe the virus wouldn't have happened or it would have acted different. The virus doesn't care who the American president is. It's busy infecting the other 6.7 billion people in the world not American.
[comment]The markets would still have crashed and she would lose the next election to some sort of REAL fascist.
[comment]But all those Bernie supporters told me Trump and Hillary were literally the same....
[comment]You know what I tell the morons on the right? I tell them to live in the here and now. Forget about Hillary and move on. This post is stupid.
[comment]Hillary was great and it is a damn shame so many people who should have known better gleefully engaged in demonizing her
[comment]This also wouldn't of happen if Bernie won[comment]It still would have happened. We would have just been prepared better.
[comment]64 million people voted for her

77k in 3 states decided not to.
[comment]Trump did not vote for Iraq War like Hilary.
[comment]I hate trump more than anyone and of course any functioning adult could have done a better job but it‚Äôs unreasonable to say this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Hillary was president.
[comment]Actually[comment]Are we talking about destroying the image of the US presidency through Twitter?
[comment]Pretty sure China itself is the one to blame[comment]Could we have reacted better or sooner ...yes 
But look at how many asshoels are still out there partying and ignoring rules to social distance. The other thing people don‚Äôt consider is how much this would affect the global economy. I believe that really played into how things rolled out. 

Does he lack proper grammar and speaking in full sentences. Yes

Does he contradict himself. Yes

Do people blame him for everything regardless of facts. Yes

Do people continue to share misinformation as facts yes


https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/17/instagram-posts/celebrities-are-sharing-misleading-post-about-trum/

If people could put aside their hate and look at some actually facts we might have a les polarized country. 

The guy does not speak well and is clearly a narcissist but a lot of crap he gets blamed for in just not true. 

Btw the crap the dems are jamming into this bill to pass support is a joke. Make the bill about funding. Ok they can‚Äôt agree. Then just agree to pass something but make the bill say we can change or update this in xxx days if needed. And get that crap passes.
[comment]Your right. We would have been bankrupt a lot sooner.
[comment]Hence why we need to vote for Bernie 2020 :)
[comment]oh please
as someone who doesn‚Äôt like Trump or Hillary
trump obviously shit the bed on this one[comment]He tied to tell you idiots about it in January and even put China on a travel ban. He was then in demoncrap fashion called a racist and the ban was overturned by fascist judges.

It would have happened in some form.

She is a lying corrupt piece of shit too but not on a trump level...he has his own special category.

[comment]Would not trust those numbers from China[comment]China is lying
[comment]This is a stupid graph. Per capital matters
Now
But these graphs are just misleading.
[comment]Is this per capita? If we have 10x the population of a country we are being compared to then this is critical to account for.
[comment]Please read this understanding that these are hypothetical numbers chosen to illustrate a point about graphs and information presentation rather than argue actual infection rates. 

If country #1 has 1
This is the flaw in the graph above. If you don't account for the population you will be led to believe that a 50% infection rate is better than a 0.4% infection rate.

Cmon guys get your head out of your ass.
[comment] Those China numbers are BS.
[comment]We aren‚Äôt testing properly[comment]The mayor of NYC should have told people to stock up on food and social distance rather than go on the subway and go to parades.
[comment]Adjust per capita. The numbers are meaningless otherwise.
[comment]You don't have to report cases if you're killing off your population intentionally. Looking at you[comment]Should probably add up the european countries as a better proxy to compare U.S. to though.
[comment]When can we start saying ‚ÄúThanks[comment]Most are lying (spoiler alert) plus it's cases per million that shed more light
How is it logical to compare USA to any other country when it comes to population as well as overall containment? 

I get the point of the post[comment]Be weary of any numbers from a dictatorship.  Trump "thought" he could blue sky this thing and force people to under-report the enormity and truth if this thing.  China[comment]Doesn't really matter which party you fall behind. The harsh truth is that us has been exposed to be unable to handle any sort of fast spreading virus[comment]I‚Äôm most curious to see what happens in Sweden.

[comment]Aren't the democrats the people who don't want us to have national healthcare[comment]Yeah I'm gonna go with not trusting the China numbers. The entire Chinese bureaucracy is based on fudging numbers and there is no way to get an accurate estimate of their infection rate/death rate. Even if China knew the numbers
Still[comment]COVID-19 data from China should not be allow in r/dataisbeautiful it can‚Äôt be trusted.

https://www.france24.com/en/20200331-stacks-of-urns-in-wuhan-raise-doubts-about-china-s-official-virus-toll
[comment]A few thoughts here:

1. A cumulative graph that isn't normalized is going to necessarily look worse for a large country (China notwithstanding with likely bad data.)
2. This data is 8 days old. A lot has happened since then.
3. Confirmed data is effectively meaningless since there's no consistency globally in testing per capita or even test quality. Chinese tests are notoriously bad
For all the self-hatred we have here in the US
And depending on how you parse the data
[https://www.ft.com/\_\_origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbbea4f72-7b71-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03?fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;source=next&amp;width=1260)

[comment]If you think his campaign treats them like the enemy[comment] &gt;Biden-curious suburbanites

That is some icky phrasing.

[comment]Too late to change that. Too bad.

[comment]Drumph LOL!
[comment]Im getting tired of this performative bullshit.  Nancy Pelosi voted to increase Trumps military budget just a few weeks ago and were worried about how the republicans are going to frame us.  They will never tell the truth about us so we need to organize and start holding them and us accountable.

Also read Chomskys book manufactured consent you fucking libs.
[comment]I didn't watch the speech (proud that I've never watched a Trump speech) but this was an awesome moment.
[comment]Fine - let's start two lists.   One of code violations by current SotH and one list of code violations by current POTUS.    I wonder which one will be longer and/or more egregious?

[comment]Remember that Republican who yelled "You lie!" at President Obama at one of his SOTU speeches?

If Republicans didn't have double standards[comment]I would have burned it right there.
[comment]Let's not forget the "YOU LIE!!!!" Comment. 

In the voice of comic book guy. Worst president ever!!
[comment]She might as well have said ‚ÄúGrab him by the pussy!‚Äù
[comment]I am pretty sure that this was the point of her act as well as letting us Democrats know we still have people as well.  Trump was having a campaign rally and that is not what the SOTU is meant to be.

[comment]Stupid stunts like rippung up the speech RAISES TRUMPS APPROVAL NUMBERS. The Democratic leadership can't help but fuck up EvErYtHiNg! JFC. Serial bunglers.
[comment]What a embarrassment for the Democratic Party.

[comment]What a toxic place to be. This shitty subreddit.
[comment]Our life in Bizzaroworld continues
[comment]They must not follow Trump on Twitter....
[comment]Isn‚Äôt it weird that we measure civility only on the other side? People on the left are just fine with Nancy being disrespectful because he is too but...shouldn‚Äôt in civility be bad all around? We cant come to agreement that that was a petty thing to do? Nobody ever calls out people on their own side

[title]President Trump impeached for abuse of power[selftext]https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/18/trump-impeached-by-house-for-high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html[comment]Fuck yeah.
[comment]The MF is impeached. Amen. Now the treasonous Republicans will do their worst. Make them pay[comment]"gg ez"
[comment]This is an empty victory at best. Anyone who thinks he‚Äôll actually be removed from office is delusional and I‚Äôve got a bridge to sell them. Also[comment]This wouldn't have happened without all the work that folks put in to winning the House in 2018. Thank you all!
[comment]It will never get through congress :(
[comment]This is historic[comment]Great. Now we vote him out and throw him and his family in jail for decades. #nopardon
[comment]About fucking time.
[comment]SoDoes some other High Crimes etc etc. Can he be impeached again (in 2nd term)?
[comment]Now the question - largely rhetorical - is whether our leaders intend to see this through
Removing Donald Trump from power is not optional if this to be a free country
So
The fact that the impeachment charges don't include Espionage is not encouraging.  

It looks perfunctory.  

For three years
Though I'll never say "too" little or too late.
[comment]This isn't the end of the fight[comment]See y‚Äôall in r/drunk tonight lol
[comment]Its good that we did it but i doubt anything will happen as a result [comment]This is only the first step.

But it feels pretty damn good.
[comment]‚ÄúI‚Äôm not orange[comment]Boo hoo hoo. Cry me a river. What a scumbag trump is. He can go eat a big bag of shit. Exactly what he deserves.
[comment]Press F to dab on the Grave of the GOP
[comment]He‚Äôs not impeached yet
Take a breath and wait for the rest of it to play out. We might not be out of this yet.
[comment]So you all must be so proud. As a Veteran who served in Afghanistan it makes me outraged that Pelosinwould even mention our service when referring to this debochal. I hope you look forward to OUR President Trump for the next term as well.

[comment]Just mind blowing that 42.7% of people think he‚Äôs doing just fine
[comment]We should see a spike again in about 2-3 weeks when the people who caught it this weekend spread spread it through the population w/o even knowing.

[selftext]https://www.vox.com/2020/4/20/21225016/protests-stay-at-home-orders-trump-conservative-group-michigan[comment]Huh.. That high..  that'd include a lot of tRumpies
[comment]What can you tell us about the 19%?
[comment]Though 100% of the 19% agree with ending immigration during this trying time
[comment]Even my dad thinks these guys are jackasses and he is a hardcore trumper.
[comment]So 19% are MAGA nuts...  I'm surprised there are that many nuts out there[comment]These are obviously small pockets of idiots being organized by right-wing groups that are very likely organized themselves and funded by the groups working to get Trump reelected. This is a very calculated move made to cast a bad light on blue governors[comment]&gt;Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

The idiocy of the jackass holding that sign is painful...
[comment]Haha ‚ÄúGive me liberty or give me Covid 19‚Äù....wow[comment]1/5 of Americans agree with right-wing anti-quarantine mobs. thats terrifying.
[comment]Seems like the rural folks are jealous that the urban folks have all the Covid they want some for themselves. Idiots.
[comment]&gt; Give me liberty or give me COVID-19!

That can be arranged.
[comment]19% is 19% more than 3 months ago. At this rate[comment]Disagree is much too gentle. I find these people to be disgusting. They are ignorant[comment]19% of Americans are fucking insane.
[comment]Trump plus Fox News are a fatal combo for these sad folk. But these actions will affect those that are following SIP[comment]If only they couldn‚Äôt spread it to others I‚Äôd say let em die.
[comment]They are just virus vectors.
[comment]They are fake[comment]Fringe nuts. Every country has them unfortunately.
[comment]they're just following their god emperor's commands. I wanna see all 81% of those polled at the ballot box this november.
[comment]The ‚Äúno lives matter‚Äù movement.
[comment]&gt;‚ÄúYou know
Polling around that time put Trump around 38-40% so yeah[comment]Protests you don‚Äôt agree with are mobs now?

Propaganda much?
[comment]But dRump agrees with them and is inciting them to continue. He is directly responsible for the second wave when it comes.
[comment]It seems like there are so many of them cause they are so LOUD. But I think most people with any brain at all get that these people are insane. I even have some hardcore trump supporters in my family who think they are being ridiculous. I am trying to bite my tongue in telling them that is how they all sound when trying to defend that monster.... lol
[comment]If they were only putting themselves in danger I‚Äôd laugh. These people are murderers
[comment]Sadly[comment]815 of Americans disagree with dying[comment]Here's what the "expert" observers are missing: Trump and his conservative backers have to do this because the total self-identified GOP base shrunk since 2016 from 29% to 24%.

In other words
So
The media is still going to sell the horserace[comment]When 81 percent of Americans agree on anything[comment]We should issue protest permits to them but limit it to the covid critical care wards.
[comment]Assuming the ~20% are mostly Trumpy conservatives[comment]Phoenix these idots popped up and like in Colorado nurses showed up to counter protest. It's sad that the very people they rely on for medical care and maybe one day life saving emergency care are the one's they endanger and disrespect. Those same medical professionals will provide the care because its engrained in their DNA to help no matter who or what. Mindblowing
[comment]What about the other 19%. How was the questioned asked because I would be horrified if 19% actually believed in this.

I have not read the article yet but I‚Äôll get to it.

Edit: just read the article and it‚Äôs 19% believed that we need less Social distancing which could just mean a slow economy which I disagree with but is better then these protesters.
[comment]that‚Äôs weird. usually the split between sane people and crazies in this country ends up being roughly 60/40
[comment]Who would have thought?
[comment]Is this really a partisan issue?
[comment]AMERICA: ONLY 19% STUPID! 

JUST GIVE US ANOTHER 236 YEARS! 

WE WILL GET THOSE PEOPLE WISED UP!
[comment]So about 70 million agree?
[comment]Conservatives are hilarious. They'll protest abortion claiming they are saving lives
I don't get it.
[comment]Only 81%?  1 in 5 Americans supports thinks epidemiology is fiction?   

Whoa boy ...
[comment]Christian ISIS? CHRISIS?
[comment]The context of the survey was:

‚Äúshould continue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus
The protesters were against the lockdown and not necessarily social distancing.  This is a blatant misinterpretation of the poll.
[comment]If I see these protestors in Albuquerque I'm going to hell shit at them.
[comment]This all illustrates sowing and reaping. The Governors who are opening too early are going to get all sorts of great results for the first three weeks and it is after that that the hospitalizations and deaths will start growing and growing. As in so many other things[comment]Similar to 2008[comment]They show up with guns because it helps make them appear less impotent. There should be no guns allowed at a legally organized rally. It limits those with different opinions. The students at Kent state in Ohio in 1970 didn't have guns. They weren't children like these grown men.
[comment]Boy do I live and work in the wrong place. It feels like I‚Äôm the minority.
[comment]Saw this on Twitter.  From now on they should be called the Flu Klux Klan.
[comment]Despite making up only 19% of the population[comment]The Very Loud[comment]Did you ask every 263 million Americans or is this based on a small sample of left-leaning people. No offense but just curious.
[comment]Fuck every asshole protesting quarantines
[comment]I'm so sad to admit my MIL attended one... Thank goodness for living states away
[comment]I've been reading through both what libs and cons have been saying about these protestsI've seen so many dumbasses give some of the most braindead arguments in favor of the protest. Guess what? Theres a way for you to test the constitutional validity of what you're doing; it's called the fucking supreme court. I really hope that from the next time some dumbfuck starts on this 'freedom to protest' psychobabble[comment]you know how in Iran ppl would be paid to protest and carry Death to America signs and get free lunches so it would look like there was a mass hatred of America?  I think this is the American version of this.
[comment]It‚Äôs not a right wing protest[comment]It saddens me that it‚Äôs only 81%
[comment]im pretty sure there are left-wing people who are also anti-quarantine.  Saying its only right-wing people is just pure propaganda.
[comment]Protest and die[comment]I agree that the number is substantial[comment]All it takes it one positive test and the health department can quarantine all of them.
[comment]That still leaves way too many people.
[comment]There are some Republican Governors and representatives doing an ok job. However they don‚Äôt have the balls to speak against trump and will pander to his rhetoric despite them secretly doing the right things as blue state governors. I am from NC and our governor is a Democrat and he is getting so much shade. I suspect though it is a vocal minority doing this. I live in the RTP and all the Republicans I know agree the state should be shut for now. They say things like we have to reopen eventually but should be shut for now. Nonetheless the mainstream GOP will pander to the organized right wing nut job organizations

[comment]My REAL PRESIDENT talking #truth.
[comment]Now do the 2nd amendment.
[comment]The Republicans sure seem to think it's a privilege.  Or at least want it to be.
[comment]Owning a gun is also a right. Is Hillary saying that every convicted felon in the country should be able to go out and buy a gun?  With no background check?

[comment]Their ideas can't survive contact with reasonable people. 

Treat your ban like the compliment that it is.
[comment]üëçüñêÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è to all my Democratic unknown friends out there in the Reddit world[comment]I actually requested the mods ban me after I got into a good little spat on r/Republican (and they obliged me). It was liberating as I no longer attempt to squeeze any semblance of common sense out of the deplorables by using arguments that they have historically beat everyone else over the head with. TL;DR - congratulations!
[comment]It‚Äôs a cult of personality thing with Trump. It‚Äôs sort of similar with Sanders types. Any dissent is met with extreme vitriol. Fortunately[comment]I mean all it takes is one member of the secret service who actually cares about his country and then Trump will cease to exist
[comment]I'm probably older than you but that doesn't mean anything as far as who someone votes for[comment]Congrats Blue Hero!
[comment]I'm banned from there and conservative too. 

I think one of them I was a bit antagonistic and kind of hostile. 

The other one I genuinely was just trying to get someone to elaborate and explain their view. I wasn't trying to troll and instigate anything. I just wanted understand why they felt the way they did and try to look at their side. 

They just threw out personal attacks at liberals and Democratic politicians and said we're/they're idiots. 

I asked again to explain again without using liberals or Democrats in their explanation and Im now banned.
[comment]you should take a peek over at r/POLITIC

it's basically T_D vs the world with no mods.

[comment]I got permanently banned from r/politics for saying that I'd pay good money to give Junior a good slapping.

Seemed a bit arbitrary[comment]I got banned for quoting Trump **verbatim**[comment]I was banned from a Republican group on Facebook for trying to set them straight.
[comment]Surprisingly I'm not banned despite some wholehearted attempts at it. I like to pop in there every once and a while to remind them that they're ignorant racists and cheerleading polices they jeered at when it was a democrat enacting them.
[comment]The Cons can't be reasoned with.  .
[comment]um we both have the same rules? you just broke them
[comment]I don't understand a lot about Reddit what is n/wordbot or whatever I don't say the n word there's a lot of words I don't say so do I get responses from those bots also for not saying the words that I'm not supposed to or shouldn't say?
[comment]Now I understand how you wrote that post about the propaganda my apologies to you sir[comment]I was banned from politics for telling someone that they are a bad person for supporting Kavanaugh

And from Pete Buttigieg for not thinking we should listen to neo-cons like Jen Rubin about Iraq/Iran

I hope the voter turnout is bigger than ever as well.
[comment]That's great and all[comment]It was a great debate. Glad so many tuned in. 

Klobuacher and Warren were pretty spicy. 

Bloomberg really bombed. He wasn‚Äôt well prepared for the push back and reaction from the other candidates.
[comment]I went in hoping to watch everyone take a collective shit on Bloomberg. I was not disappointed. I was also ecstatic to see Warren finally take that stick out of her ass[comment]Warren‚Äôs campaign should be ecstatic[comment]I watched mostly to see Warren hammer the new york pork dork
[comment]Question from a foreigner: What is the fanfare/anthem played in the introductiom and during breaks? I hear it being played on podcasts about politics too when they are discussing the primaries.
[comment]Any explanation why? 

All the other debates have been steady decreases and lows for Democratic debates
Did this many people tune in for Bloomberg or did they just tune in after hearing a billionaire was getting roasted on national television? 

So interesting

Bloomberg cannot purchase a better reputation so he‚Äôs not really a viable candidate anymore. I really
Klobuchar cannot outflank Buttigieg or Biden[comment]A big part of this was curiosity about the billionaire who had bought his way onstage. And I'm very glad to know that 20 million people watched him be eviscerated by Warren.
[comment]They were all fighting each other. I don‚Äôt think I like any of them if they can‚Äôt stop
[comment]Shout out to Tom Perez[comment]Warren does so well with these things.  She eviscerated Bloomberg rather cleanly.
[comment]Of all the ones to be most watched[comment]It‚Äôs pretty blatantly obvious after watching the ‚Äúreplays‚Äù NBC and MSNBC are posting[comment]Does anyone else find Pete super smug? I want to like him but I just can‚Äôt the more I actually watch him. He speaks eloquently sure but I just find him giving off such smug vibes. Which seems weird because he has such little experience. Is it just me?
[comment]What a disgrace. Warren and Kolbawhatever should take a piss and fuck off. Pete should go back to his village. Bloomberg should learn how to speak. Biden sounds too desperate. 40 years in Government nothing happened. Tell him to go fuck Thomas in the Supreme Court as he was a disgrace in the senate the way he behaved with dr. Hill. Sander should go past fucking sound bites. I am ashamed to be a democratic.
[comment]The networks should be basically only broadcasting these debates on these days. Regularly scheduled programming is halted for the SOTU address[comment]Lies[comment]Why is Bloomberg there?

How did he possibly qualify after joining late and ...No on liking him???

Was he any good? On Colbert he came across as just unnecessary and insincere and weak.
[comment]That‚Äôs great news.  Now[comment]I thought it was really good.  They got out all of the issues on people's mind about each candidate and they debated it.  Hopefully
He is conveniently a republican when it suits him..Bloomberg supported the police department‚Äôs ‚Äústop-and-frisk‚Äù policy that disproportionately targeted minority men.

[comment]That's a non answer lolololol
[comment]Imagine believing that if people don't support you they de facto support Trump... Joe Biden's gross and if we give him the nomination we'll lose the election.

[comment]He didnt mention job.  Let's face it. Some of us are being considered expendable.  My factory is still working building battery test systems.  Grocers gas station attendants and other low wage people who cant afford to voluntarily stay home are being forced to risk themselves and their families with 0 additional compensation. None of us have any hope that we will be remembered when this is done. We are not getting hazard pay and very few companies are offering us anything more than work your shitty job twice as hard for the same pay with more risk.  We cant just go get new jobs. We are stuck and we are being taken advantage of.  While most of the world is relaxing at home we are hurting ourselves for you. It's great that the govs are putting out stimulus checks and paying for up to 90%of companies salaries.  Bailouts for companies who used their cash reserves to buy back stock instead of taking care of its worker.  Every one of us that works at this level understands something a lot of the people making decisions dont seem to get.  They can always replace us.  Always. There will always be someone out there in a worse position. So they will  agree to anything in hope's of taking one more step up. There are plenty of memes saying thank you.  But tbh that doesnt do shit for any of us.  Your thank yous dont pay for my food or rent.  Your thank yous do not get us the ppe we need to stay safe. We keep working while you cry about staying home.. do you have any idea how much we would like to have a 2 week vacation at home?  We are the people least likely to have ever had such time off yet we are the ones being pushed to keep working.  We are looked down on and paid shit every day now all the sudden we are " essential "
[comment]Then support m4a or your words are meaningless.
[comment]I agree.  I saw Sanders say the same many times recently.

But where has joe been? I even heard a rumour he has the virus and is gravely ill.   I would hope if he plans on being president he embraces Medicare for all as this crisis is showing the true cost of care and the division in America the wealth divide creates.

[comment]Are we certain reelecting Trump isn't his goal?
[comment]Bloomberg would love nothing more than 4 more years of Trump. All of these shitty billionaires do. 

Tax the fuck out of them all.
[comment]He's going to get Bernie elected
[comment]Yep[comment]never say never...who really thought the idiot in the white house would win?
[comment]As he is a billionaire[comment]Just vote and get everyone you know to vote too.
[comment]Bloombergs goal isn't to elect Trump[comment]The same could be said if Warren and Sanders. Just don‚Äôt think their policies are what the majority of Americans want. Biden still stands the best chance to defeat Trump[comment]The only spoiler Bloomberg will play is Biden's. He's going to hand the nomination to Sanders or Warren[comment]I think that informing people about Bloomberg's policy positions will actually help Democrats. It would cause disaffected Republicans to vote for Bloomberg. The Democratic party voters have no love for that guy.
[comment]Im pretty sure thats why he entered the election
[comment]Boomerberg running for president just solidifies for me that he prefers Trump over Bernie or Warren because both would make him pay more in taxes.
[comment]I just saw a tv ad for this guy[comment]I hate to be a conspiracy theorist but he was on Anderson's cooper a while back and volunteered he had met with Epstien. Anderson didn't even ask. The presidency is the new get of jail free card.
[comment]I am not a fan of Bloomberg at all[comment]During this next election[comment]This guy needs to stop invoking 9/11 in his obnoxious Youtube ads.  He's acting like Giuliani.

[comment]They're either very low intelligence[comment]Who wants to date someone with the emotional intelligence of a 5 year old?
[comment]trumpism is a damn fine indicator of a serious lack of rationality.
[comment]I find it difficult to not punch them in the face. And 3/4 seems low to me. The 1/4 must be the dumbdems that voted for Biden[comment]I started chatting with one once... second question she asked me was if I supported the orange racist.  Said yes (I don‚Äôt)  

Was some of the most awful hatred I‚Äôd ever seen anyone text.  Just kept pushing to see how much more I could get out of her.  In then end I actually felt bad for her.  Said Obama was the best president ever and told her to have a great day

The absolute horror texts I got after that were hilarious
[comment]Have you spoken to any of them? Can't imagine having to sit through a couple of hours.
[comment]I think women like bad boys[comment]True story: I dated a trump supporter ONCE
I am truly stunned there even exists a 25% that would consider dating these people.
[comment]These are rookie numbers people[comment]Reminds me of the interviews in Behind the Curve documentary about flat earthers where they talk about people dumping them or not going on another date  after finding out they're a flat earther.
[comment]Only three quarters?
[comment]I already get enough racism and xenophobia from my relatives. Don‚Äôt need that shit from a SO.
[comment]One-quarter of single Democrats are truly desperate[comment]And the other quarter think they can fix him or her.
[comment]I mean I‚Äôm sure the feeling is mutual.
[comment]Embarrassingly[comment]Because who would want to date someone who is bigoted and/or ignorant and/or plain stupid and/or uninformed? There‚Äôs a slim chance they‚Äôre uninformed and then you can educate them[comment]Damn right. Can't even picture it.
[comment]Im not attracted to idiots either
[comment]It ends up in unhealthy territory.

You end up feeling like you have to save her.  Or else getting into some dark shit where you're willing to be a slave to her.

The Carver/Matlin thing only exists because neither of them actually believe in anything.
[comment]I don't think I should date at all because physical contact makes me uncomfortable and I like my time to myself too much[comment]I‚Äôd fuck one as hard as I could out of spite lmao
[comment]The real question is what percentage of democrats would date someone that didnt vote in 2016. Cause they lowkey voted for Trump too[comment]Ugh! Ex girlfriend was a republican and thought Nixon was framed and given a raw deal. Why I hung in there for the next 6 months baffles me but breaking up was a little bit easier due to a lack of compatibility.
[comment]I stop talking to them when I find out.
[comment]I was looking at the numbers closely and what stands out is that less than college educated democrats were more likely to date a Republican
Something else that stood out at me is the number of Democrats who would not date a Hillary Clinton voter[comment]Buncha incels
[comment]Very tolerant
[comment]Democrats have morals.
[comment]That‚Äôs embarrassing
[comment]I started dating a trump supporter back in April 2018. We are still together
Not all Trump supporters are beyond help.
[comment]I'm always torn about things like this as I consider turn-about to be fair play.  


I tell myself that we shouldn't expect or extend fair play rules to literal nazis

This situation sucks.
[comment]I‚Äôm a liberal currently dating a trump supporter. Can confirm it is very hard to even mention the current state of the world. Love her dearly though.
[comment]They are between the levels of dumb too batshit crazy. Why would someone sane want that?
[comment]Of course. Total red flag.
[comment]I wanted to say that being a Trump supporter is sorta like being an incel[comment]If this is your biggest concern
I‚Äôm going to go against the flow here[comment]I found out a girl I dated over two decades ago is a Trump supporter and I still felt the need to gargle mouth wash for 30 minutes.
[comment]F
[comment]Martin Luther King
How could you ever date someone who makes such disgusting choices? "Its just a political difference you're bullying us this is as bad as raciiiism"
[comment]I‚Äôm a gay man.  One of my coworkers wanted to set me up with a friend of hers.  She showed me some pics; good-looking guy.  Then she told me he‚Äôs a conservative Republican and I was like ‚Äúno thanks[comment]The other 25% are very drunk.
[comment]You guys do know that there is a massive difference between Trump voters and Trump supporters[comment]I'd be down for one date. Wouldn't mind seeing where we'd go. If he did any moves tho...
[comment]The same democrats who voted biden into the nomination. And don't come with least he's not as bad as trump. It's like offering stage 1 cancer vs stage 3 cancer. Yeah one is worse but its still cancer.
[comment]Dem/progressive women start off calling you an asshole[comment]how relevant
[comment]Why would they want to date an 80-year-old anyway?
[comment]It's called natural selection.
[comment]Why would I date someone so hateful and brainwashed?
[comment]Do you honestly think that a trump supporter would even want to date an opinionated
Really?
[comment]Won‚Äôt DATE?! Hell[comment]My in laws are on the opposite sides of things and they don't talk about politics.

But[comment]Yeah Hot but crazy[comment]I won't even be friends with Trump supporters. I'm cutting ties with all  but the closest family[comment]The other 1/4 are 16 and under. Right? Please?
[comment]Did it once...never again!
[comment]It's hard enough to get along with Trumpified relatives.
[comment]my girlfriend wouldnt[comment]Usually blatant stupidity is a turn off so this is not surprising
[comment]This is why in each and every relationship that makes it past the third date mark[comment]I have disowned Trumpers. I would like to see the stats on that.
[comment]I don‚Äôt hate Republicans[comment]My younger brother voted for Trump. Not because he supported him
I haven't spoken to him in three years.
[comment]That‚Äôs because[comment]20 years ago I was a Republican who dated a Democrat. Haven‚Äôt voted Republican since the 2000 Primary when my girlfriend convinced me that ‚Äúeven Gore‚Äù would better than Bush Jr. 

Sometimes you meet someone hot enough to make you question your values.
[comment]I'd rather have a boil implant at to date a MAGA virus.
[comment]So[comment]But female Trump supporters are easy[comment]I wouldnt...
[comment]Who the fuck pays for this nonsense? Surveys take a lot of time and money and someone thought this was worth both?
[comment]Not surprised
[comment]Sympatric speciation
[comment]If I was single I'd date a Trump supporter.

I've always wondered what it would be like to be the smartest person in the relationship.
[comment]Just being in the vicinity of a tRump supporter is reprehensible.
[comment]My grandma is a democrat an my grandpa is a trump voter but he‚Äôs at least not racist or sexist or homophobic. I bet they have a fun time at the polling booth
[comment]You are essentially saying you'd date someone who is ok being a racist[comment]Hell no üëé
[comment]Dating mentally challenged people seems problematic
[comment]Can't fix stupid[comment]What‚Äôs wrong with the other 25%?
[comment]Especially now[comment]I wouldn't even date someone who didn't fully participate in Democratic Party activities and work on campaigns with me.
[comment]If you have to draw the line at political preference
You should have an open mind that isn‚Äôt based on who they voted for.

[title]Your vote in November will likely decide who Ruth Bader Ginsburg's successor will be on the Supreme Court. If you want that successor to be a progressive[selftext]If DT chooses the next Supreme Court judge[comment]Hold me hostage I love it.
[comment]Support the Senate candidates in contested races as well. Biden can prevent another right wing judge but he can‚Äôt seat any judges without Senate confirmation. 

McConnell has already shown he‚Äôd rather leave those positions vacant than allow any Democratic nominee to be confirmed.
[comment]I do not like biden....but..RBG is the uber important...I will swallow pride and bite my tongue off but no Republicans will get my vote
[comment]No.
[comment]Are democrats calling themselves progressives now?
[comment]The next Supreme Court Justice to be replaced could be could be RBG or Thomas[comment]The Supreme Court has to be secured PERIOD!!!
[comment]I can hear the gun pointed at my head being cocked.
[comment]The Supreme court has been a conservative majority since the 1970s. 

Garland/Gorsuch was the first opportunity in all that time to flip it liberal. 

If Trump gets 4 more years
Having a 6-3 conservative majority
If you want ANY
Vote Biden
Also[comment]Let RBG retire already!!!!
[comment]The DNC/Biden better start finding ways to earn independent/swing votes then. If they can't do this
They need to start figuring out how to appeal to young voters and to Bernie's supporters. Polls are saying that Biden/Trump are tied at 44% of young voters
Also
You can't expect people to vote for your values. People need to find their own values to vote for
You're basically telling these people their main concerns don't matter. Imagine being told that your concern over the SCOTUS doesn't matter because surviving day to day matters more? How would you react to that? We can't guilt or force people to prioritize each other's own personal values. To you
So pitting people against each other saying that this matters more isn't going to work or speak to the voters you need.
[comment]The next president (be that Biden or a second term for Trump) will likely appoint anywhere from 1-4 justices:

* RBG (89* Breyer (81* Thomas (71* Alito (70
If we win the WH and the Senate
If Trump and the GOP maintain power
We can‚Äôt let that happen.
[comment]Biden is extremely electable
I trust them[comment]So[comment]The Supreme Court is already conservative and joe Biden is also a conservative. Who cares[comment]Thank you. I‚Äôve been trying to tell some of the Bernie bro children this[comment]1. RBG needs to survive until Inauguration day
2. Lets hope the Donald doesn't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay or even cancel the general election.
[comment]He isn't the only choice. Biden can step down and a more viable candidate chosen at the convention. A lot of Bernie supporters are independent and Republicans mad at Trump. Biden absolutely can not get any of their votes. Trumps campaign is already bringing up bidens dixiecrat roots.

Democrats kept saying Bernie couldn't build a coalition[comment]Only if we also win the senate.

Otherwise[comment]The DNC is counting on people falling in line with its candidate choice. 

Like our corporate CEOs should be learning right now (but they aren‚Äôt[comment]Wasn‚Äôt Obama‚Äôs pick Merrick Garland... and wasn‚Äôt he conservative? And what about the Anita Hill situation?
[comment]Tried that argument in 2016 when three judges were in play (well done RBG for hanging in there for us) but the Bernie fundamentalists would have nothing of it. I came to the conclusion that most of them wouldn't have voted anyway which was somewhat confirmed in the primaries. All principles no action. 

My take - it's far easier to change from a position of power when you don't have a boot on your neck and a baton beating your balls (or whatever if you don't have them). Unless of course you prefer a bloody revolution and I see zero evidence that more than a tiny handful of Biden refuseniks are into that. You can't have a revolution by just liking social media posts really enthusiastically.
[comment]Biden voted for Scalia
[comment]Should have retired literally anytime between 08-16. Hubris got us in this mess.
[comment]Not without Senate. Not voting for Biden.
[comment]buh Biden needs to EARN muh vote!

nah but seriously Trump will nominate a 55 year old hyper-conservative to replace RBG[comment]No üôè
[comment]Yeah[comment]Ya the Democrats not winning is totalitarianism.

Finding wedges to drive between each other is doing Putin's work for him.
[comment]I don‚Äôt think this is a fair assessment AT ALL. Don‚Äôt get my wrong: Trump is one of the worst if not THE WORST president we‚Äôve ever had. I would never in a million years vote for him and I will be happy when he is out of office. But to say that a war with Iran would be the fault of everyone that voted for him (1) absolves the Trump administration of responsibility and (2) doesn‚Äôt take into account how broken the political system in the US is and why Trump was elected in the first place.

[title]The Nightmare Scenario: Trump Loses in 2020 and Refuses to Concede - Kentucky governor's baseless voter fraud claims have experts worried Trump will do the same.
[selftext]https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nv98/the-nightmare-scenario-trump-loses-in-2020-and-refuses-to-concede[comment]Hopefully he won't make it to 2020
[comment]I can't imagine he will lose in 2020. I will be voting for him even though I am a registered Democrat. The Democratic candidates are weak this time and damn near incompetent.
[comment]Oh[comment]He already said he wouldn‚Äôt accept a losing result  during a debate with Hillary.
[comment]My nightmare is that he is impeached[comment]Ok[comment]The nightmare is him getting reelected.
[comment]he was already refusing to accept defeat in 2016 before he realized that he'd succeeded in stealing the election.  so we need to prepare for 2020 for sure.
[comment]I will certainly admit that Trump is different[comment]I am fully expecting that to happen.

He's gonna call in the people that have been stocking guns to siege Washington. 

We are going to see how patriotic they really are.
[comment]pretty likely scenario we need to prepare for in advance
[comment]Trump is going to prison if he loses. He will do this and more.
[comment]I wouldn't mind voting against him twice. I'm pretty sure he would lose by a wider margin in a second vote.
[comment]Fortunately
That‚Äôs not to say that Faux Nooz and the Trumpies won‚Äôt find a way to make up some bullshit argument about how he won the election even though he lost.

I would think the nightmare scenario would be him winning the popular vote and losing the electoral. Then suddenly he would claim it is time to retroactively invalidate the electoral college. Who knows what this Supreme Court would do with that.
[comment]Handcuffs. That's what will happen. Trump in handcuffs
[comment]He claimed there was voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election.... Spoiler alert[comment]Although this is a very real possibility. I want to believe that considering Republicans in office won't be so caught up in tying themselves to someone who will (almost certainly) have been impeached and lost reelection.

They can make a clean break from Trump and not be held hostage anymore but an impulsive divisive President. What we've seen lately is hitching your wagon to the Trump train is not the best way to win elections. 

I think we know most Republican senators don't like Trump and can see a way out without having to speak out against him. They can talk about how the peaceful transition and elections have consequences.

I'm an optimist and idealist so I tend to believe the best in people so that my.color my views but I'm hopeful.
[comment]He would need to take complete control of the military[comment]Presumes he makes it to the next election. 

The real nightmare scenario is we get to November 2020 and the Republicans have no candidate.
[comment]Hopefully 2020 will be such a bloeout their will be no argument[comment]Concession is not a legal process. It doesn't matter if he doesn't concede. What matters is if he doesn't leave the White House
[comment]There is no basis for believing this would happen. The second the president elect is sworn in[comment]I'd say the real nightmare is Trump winning... But yes
I hope he is defeated by such a huge margin that there's no way for him to go down this path. This should be the goal. Complete annilhation of Trumpism.
[comment]well[comment]Then the next president will have him dragged away. Looking forward to it.
[comment]Like anything else[comment]Won't work. He will squeal as he is dragged to the curb[comment]Who cares if he refuses to concede? Like it or not if he loses he will no longer be president[comment]There's a straightjacket with his name on it if he even tries!
[comment]Russia will see to it that he prevails.  He will once again carry a number of key swing states by relatively small margins.  He will lose the popular vote \[again\] and win the electoral votes and the presidency.  

Russian hackers will once again throw the election in Trump's favor.
[comment]We should pass voter ID laws so he doesn‚Äôt have an excuse
[comment]Secret service will remove him and new president will be sworn in.
[comment]Fuck that notion. If he loses and refuses to call cede
We don‚Äôt let a despot to control the narrative.
[comment]Expect it. Unless it's a landslide victory for us[comment]If all the Democrats in America voted in 2016
GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO VOTE!
[comment]Honestly[comment]&gt;Feaver said Trump‚Äôs rhetoric is at the very least ‚Äúdeeply irresponsible"

That's the understatement of the century.
[comment]A narrow loss guarantees this outcome
[comment]Chaos is Trumps middle name (well that and Donald)
[comment]I have no doubt that when Trump looses that is exactly what he will do.

The bigger question is what will his lackeys do ?

Will they follow him down that rabbit hole or finally grow a spine and honor their oath to uphold the constitution ?

Sticking with Cuomo on this one. If you look at Italy and Spain[comment]I wonder if he says the same thing about fighter jets and bombs???
[comment]Correct[comment]He seems happy to downplay Coronavirus but watch his attitude suddenly change when he cancels the election on health and safety grounds.
[comment]He is retaliating against New York[comment]From the American Conservative[comment]Yet he "orders" GM and Ford on Twitter minutes ago to begin producing ventilators with numerous exclamation marks. Fake president.
[comment]Trump can‚Äôt be a real tyrant unless he manages to kill several thousand at a minimum.

Why hasn‚Äôt anyone in his cabinet told him the most fatalities would be in the Trump voter demographic.
[comment]He does know this all ends with he and his offspring in line to the gallows[comment]Try not to link to FoÂçê News.

This puppet dictator's bullshit is pretty standard at this point.
[comment]He just tweeted in all caps that ford needs to open a plant in Ohio and make ventilators...

It‚Äôs almost like crazy people have a hard time making up their minds.
[comment]Why is this petulant child still president? Seriously
The 25th amendment has been talked about to death
Under the amendment's fourth stipulation
Section IV reads:
"Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide

He should be held criminally liable for spreading misinformation and endangering people.
[comment]Dr. Trump
[comment]He didn‚Äôt believe positives would go up. Lie after lie[comment]Right[comment]He canceled the deal with GM today to make them.  Fuck him. He should be charged with manslaughter.

Trump cries that Obama needs Congressional approval before air strikes.
[comment]Shut the fuck up. Nobody cares about congressional approval.

We just started a war by assassinating a top general. With or without congressional approval[comment]Isn‚Äôt this the distraction Trump wants[comment]Fuck Trump.
[comment]I‚Äôm afraid this isn‚Äôt going to be regional at all. As a result of this strike there will be attacks in the US.
[comment]I'll go out on a limb and predict that Trump properties will be early targets of retaliation.
[comment]Trump knew what he was doing. That's why he didn't tell Congress:

"A war between the United States and Iran would be a disaster. Even worse than the disaster after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Neither side can reasonably be interested in a military conflict. And yet both are currently in the process of escalating the conflict."  6 months ago during Strait of Hormuz escalation

[comment]Didn‚Äôt they say the Generals were going to stop Trump from doing something like this because they wouldn‚Äôt follow an illegal order? Isn‚Äôt assassination illegal?
[comment]Don't forget when we secured the Baghdad airport and risked lives to do so? Now its so unsecure that Iran Generals use it to attack us? You can't look at this as just an attack[comment]Not only is a war convenient for Trump. One talking point I haven't heard talked about though relates to Trump/Republicans' BFF in the middle East. A particular guy/country who has a vested interest in killing Soleimani and potentially crippling Iran[comment]Congress should cut off all funding to the military.
[comment]Does anyone know[comment]And we are all still waiting ( after reading posts ) for some entity of authority within our government to actually enforce the law.
And[comment]You need to get Congress permission to declare war. And the guy was a terrorist. I‚Äôm not mourning his death and there are a lot of Iran People who are happy he is dead. So no this is not declaration of war so he did not need congress.

This is a junk article[comment]But of course[comment]No shit. Why else would he keep putting Russia ahead of the US and our allies?

It doesn't take a genius. It takes a person not controlled by propaganda.
[comment]Let‚Äôs all act surprised üòÆ
[comment]Wait until it is corroborated. Until then[comment]His two "boys" already said they got all those money from Russia.

The son of supreme Court Justice Kennedy was the banker.

I've always felt he retired due to pressure.
[comment]I am shocked! Shocked I say! 

Seriously
Elect a clown expect a circus.
[comment]This is old news.
[comment]Might explain the [Deutche bank exec suicide](https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/deutsche-bank-death/).
[comment]This is why Trump distracted everyone with the assassination.

There's proof that he's compromised.

So he wagged the dog.
[comment]No puppet
[comment]And most world banks are backed by China.  ...soooo.
[comment]Is this the impeached and disgraced President Trump being referenced in the report?
[comment]This is like the second or third explosive report as of late. 

So many explosions. 

Is everyone ok?
[comment]Not really explosive in the sense that Russia in some way incentivized lending to Trump who in turn laundered Russian money. Probably did more than that tbh.

 But the new piece to the puzzle was the incentive to DB was a guarantee from VTB? Or was the news the fact that a guarantee from VTB was the equivalent of a guarantee from Putin? 

I keep saying[comment]Shocked that Russian money kept him afloat. Shocked I tell you

[comment]That alone makes Bloomberg OK.

Of course NOBODY is good enough for the Bernie / AOC crowd.
[comment]Considering the amount of money Bloomberg spends on his ads... I don't think you can say that he is in Trump's head "rent-free. "

Added:. Nancy pelosi however[comment]Who fucking cares! What does he plan to do for people‚Äôs lives?!

[comment]I kind of appreciate having Biden &amp; Bloomberg to soak up attacks from the right that would otherwise be focused on our actual nominee.

You can tell they are from their expression as if they have a bottle of hand sanitiser waiting after shaking hands with their Democrat supporters.

They always look bored as if they would just "phone it in". No genuine smiles
Seriously I don't trust them.

Infiltrate. Disseminate. Eliminate. That's the Republican method; sway the states
They're wingers for the other side.
[comment]I really don't want Trump Stresianding Bloomberg into a contender though.

&gt;the cellular movement feels emboldened¬†by the Trump presidency  

What does the "cellular" movement refer to?  Or is that a typo maybe?
[comment]They were all asking to be excused to go to the restroom when the picture was snapped[comment]So the entire training program looks to be just one month

[comment]Good riddance[comment]And these are the dumb asses that got caught. Imagine the ones that already made it on to the force.
[comment]Why are their faces blurred out? Its a public photo[comment]Good on that governor.
[comment]Firing them was absolutely the right thing to do.

My only question is why the newspaper is pixelating their faces.¬†  This is an official class photo they posed for and knew could be  displayed.¬† Show us their faces and let this follow them around when  they are seeking future employment.¬† I'd hate to think these people  could go out and apply for other corrections or law enforcement work and  potentially be trained and hired because they left this off their  resume.¬† No one who does something like this should ever be in position  where they carry a gun[comment]Good.
[comment]The comments section has been essentially hijacked by people who rather talk about the Stanford  experiment
which has absolutely no bearing AT ALL regarding the photo OR the West Virginia Correctional Officer class
or the fact that they have been correctly fired after casually
No one is offering the phony argument that the symbol began as a prank on 4chan to "own the libs"
which is fine; in reality since real White Supremacists and real racist mass murderers have been photographed
and caught on video

So
Probably NOT; SOME are
but some of them very likely just followed along
Were ANY of them making cognizant
NO.  Absolutely NOT.  

They deserved to be fired for this[comment]Democrats are responsible for the police state a prison industrial complex also.  Stop trying to appeal to the non-existent center and get on the right side of history.

But this isn't genocide and it's irresponsible to try to say it is. Genocide is a systematic intentional action to remove a specific group from existence. Genocide is 8

Trump is criminally negligent[comment]I really hope Trump lives long enough to see what a fool history will show him to be. Corona virus will be in every history book. History will not be kind to Trump.
[comment]"Netizens"[comment]I'd call it gross incompetence[comment]What happened to the Jews is a Genocide. Rwanda[comment]I think the descendants of Armenians who‚Äôve been systemically killed by the Turks 100+ years would beg to differ.
[comment]Definitely not genocide. That‚Äôs not what happened[comment]We as Americans let that man be in office
[comment]This is a bullshit source stating an exaggerated version of the obvious to both increase its own status and discredit us.

Republicans kill lots of people by deliberate sabotage[comment]lol this OP literally doesn't understand the word "genocide"
[comment]Well[comment]People love throwing big words around. As much as I despise trump he is just irresponsible and not fit to be president.
[comment]I get that trump has had a terrible response[comment]Genocide? That‚Äôs not the right word. Gross negligence is one of the words. It could be in the territory of some form of manslaughter although I only saw one (üôè) of those press conferences and that is the one where he said‚Äùwhat have you got to lose‚Äù.

[title]Discussion Thread of tonight NBC Democratic Debate
[selftext]Democrats currently debating on NBC. Please discuss your reactions and opinions. If someone could give a link to stream or other sources to watch it[comment]My God Bloomberg is so out of touch... I haven't followed him at all except the occasional Reddit comment and meme. 

He's running satirically right? Like he's gonna reveal in a month that it's all been an act? He's trying to teach voters that Donald trump can happen to the left? And we need to be careful?

I really thought it was hyperbole calling him the lefts Donald trump. You can feel the audience holding back boos when he was talking about his tax returns. My God.
[comment]Not a single viable candidate.
[comment]I like Biden. He's definitely not my favorite candidate[comment]Is it just me.. or does it feel nearly IMPOSSIBLE to watch the democratic debates at your own pace??

I was at work when the debate started. Finding it impossible to watch from the beginning. Hell
This public information should be much much easier to find for voters. I feel like every single debate has been unnecessarily difficult to find. 

Can't rewatch it without some pundit's take or chopped up "highlight reel". 

Please someone correct me if I am wrong :-( but I have been pulling my hair out this year just trying to be informed.. and that feels so so wrong.

(sorry to rant).
[comment]I think Warren is taking a lead tonight. Good for her
[comment]This was a rough debate to watch. I think it will get more palatable once we narrow down the field. I didn‚Äôt get the presidential vibes from any candidate tonight but then again the bar has been set the lowest in our history as a nation.
[comment]I like them raising their hands like 2nd graders. Make me laugh.
[comment]chuck todd is trash
[comment]The great state of Georgia muted part of the debate 

https://youtu.be/jcPM8Oq90-E
[comment]What was that outburst ealier
[comment]Do we think any of the candidates on that stage would tab one of the others as their running mate when all is said and done? I‚Äôm having trouble thinking of a logical pairing.
[comment]Does anyone else wish these debates actually involved civil discourse instead of what feels like reality tv drama? I feel like they have to act that way because of the way the debate is structured[comment]You all saw strategy being worked tonight. Warren is in the 10-12% range and sees Bloomberg sitting at 19% (simply by spending). She went big game hunting tonight to try and pry some of that 19% into her camp. She likely succeeded
Biden seems to be comfortable just ploughing along on his record as though anyone cares what he did 20+ years ago vs. what he'll do in 2021. 

Bernie is ... well
Bottom line: tonight was about Warren and Mayor Pete trying to make this a smaller race by pulling a "This is Sparta!" to Bloomberg and Amy.
[comment]Disappointed at the lack of talk on policy[comment]Bloomberg actually did alright
[comment]Am I crazy or is Bloomberg making a lot of sense to me? I mean initially didn‚Äôt look good when he got hanged up on but afterwards I‚Äôm really liking him. Also liking Amy Klobuchar

[comment]Damn that's not even close.
[comment]I fucking hope
[comment]Aren't most of DJTs paths to victory in 2020 reliant on keeping AZ? This trend coupled with Florida having turned into a legitimate question mark for the president puts the onus back on the three Midwest states from 2016 where he won by less than a single percentage point each.  :) 

Maybe he should have tried expanding his base a little instead of spending the last three years just giving the middle finger to the 62 percent of the country that DIDN'T vote for him.

GOTV
[comment]Yeah[comment]How could mark Kelly lead that big. When he's not even been campaigning?
Does Arizona really hate Martha mcsally/Trump that much?
[comment]Arizonan here.  We must NOT become complacent.  We must turn out in record numbers and vote for Mark as if he was 5 points behind.

It's fine if the votes aren't there to pass the bills. That's how it goes. But to table legislation voted on and passed is a violation of his oath of office.

[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-livid-after-california-allows-statewide-mail-in-voting-these-votes-must-not-count[comment]Cuz Trump and most republicans would lose their seats if mail in voting was country wide
[comment]Kiss my fucking ass Trump.
[comment]Trump votes by mail himself.
[comment]He told everyone that republicans would never be elected of voting was easier[comment]Last election he claimed there were 3 million fantasy undocumented immigrants being bussed all over the place to vote in person[comment]No[comment]I wonder if he realizes that Pennsylvania passed election law reforms[comment]Let‚Äôs have the vote shoved up your ass.
[comment]The president of the United States is saying that the votes of some citizens must not count. This is getting normalized.
[comment]Good thing states run their own elections
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]This POS needs too go......to jail after losing the next election.
[comment]Like it matters for him in California anyway[comment]Trump Jail 2020!
[comment]*Absentee* votes.  Don't let them control terminology.  People know and are comfortable with absentee ballots and thats all this is.
[comment]Trump and the GOP seem intent on testing the ['4 Boxes' theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_boxes_of_liberty).
[comment]All the states rights Republicans are really going to give it to him for meddling in state elections and... Oh right.
[comment]The US military mostly votes by mail.  I guess their votes don't count?
[comment]So does that mean in Trump's weird world that states that have mail in voting[comment]Absentee ballots have been a thing since the US Civil War.  The US military votes by mail.  Is he going to disenfranchise active military from voting?

Trump only opposes mail in ballots because Republican strategists told him too many voters is bad for him.  The only fraud is Republicans trying to suppress the vote.
[comment]Oregon has voted by mail for years. Is he all the sudden going to say our votes don‚Äôt count either?
[comment]He should really just shut the fuck up. The states decide how they hold elections
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder
[comment]He's rather transparently and poorly laying out the ground work to dispute the election if it doesn't turn out in his favour.
[comment]Wow they really should have the President take an oath or something to uphold the Constitution and let everyone do conditionally protected things like vote.

Oh wait...
[comment]&gt;‚ÄòThese Votes Must Not Count‚Äô

Seems like a declaration of war on America to me.
[comment]Our president hates people voting. Lol
[comment]There should be an ad that basically paints Trump as someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in democracy[comment]Is he really gonna try to say he‚Äôs win California otherwise ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
[comment]Trump can suck my Washingtonian balls. We vote by mail here and our votes do and will forever count. No reason every state in the union couldn't do the same.
[comment]Statistically speaking[comment]How is this not impeachable?  Oh right republicans are anti American cockroaches and tyrants who want to suppress anyone who doesn‚Äôt kiss their ass.
[comment]The point is that the Republicans know that the minority of Voters who do support Trump support him enthusiastically and will jump through any Hoops to vote for him. Therefore if you make voting as difficult as possible
In my opinion the reason he has such a enthusiastic following among the ignorant is a direct response to the election of a black president and many white people feeling that this threatens their prerogatives and privileges.
[comment]My wife and i have been voting by mail for the last 5 years. Military personnel vote by mail.
[comment]Voting is so undemocratic.
[comment]If not for the Cal Supreme Court ruling against the requirement Trump wouldn't have been able to be on the ballot because he won't disclose his taxes.

This is going to be the dirtiest[comment]Seriously what is the big deal?  Does he not want every American‚Äôs vote to count?
[comment]People should be allowed to go to the polls if they want. Although the military and Americans abroad mail in their votes[comment]Maybe if the GOP has popular policies then more votes would go to them... the problem is not the voters. The problem is policies.
[comment]Wait till he finds out about Arizona. üòÜ
[comment]And notably[comment]Says the man who mails in his vote
[comment]I am not particularly well versed in politics and I am honestly confused. What is with people being against mail-in ballots?
[comment]This just shows you if you haven't already known that this guy is so fucked up in the head I mean he really thinks he can win California. Donald j drumpf is losing his fucking mind and the right-wing followers of this dear leader I guess aren't smart enough to realize it[comment]Does he know that Oregon votes entirely by mail?

[comment]You did good Andrew!  Keep involved in politics.  Your ideas need you to champion them!
[comment]I liked a lot of his novel ideas[comment]He had some good ideas. Hopefully he stays in politics.
[comment]But he's the most popular candidate as decided by Reddit. /s
[comment]One of the few people running I respect
[comment]Girl bye
[comment]That dude was brutally honest about it. I respect that.
[comment]He was never gonna go far in this run[comment]And that was the nicest article CNN has ever written about him.

Hope we get a good endorsement soon.
[comment]See ya in 2024 bro.
[comment]Thank you for running an amazing campaign Yang!
[comment]I was hoping he would gain some momentum as his ideas are fantastic.
[comment]What  a shame for yang to drop
[comment]The yang gang got gang banged.  Run for Senate!
[comment]It wasn‚Äôt his time yet[comment]hopefully there are other offices he can run for and add some experience.
[comment]I'll miss his campaign slogan.
[comment]Yang's ideas[comment]Wonder if Bernie gets a bump
[comment]I think yang should run for mayor of a major city (preferably NY for the exposure on UBI or Detroit to help turn around an area most affected by automation) and show off what his plans can do there. That way he can get some valuable experience and he can give the most extensive demonstration of his UBI plan yet.

I think he would be an okay senator or house member as well[comment]Hopefully he is back in 2024 when more people know his name
[comment]I'll keep my yang sign parked right next to the BERNIE sign in my front yard.
[comment]UBI will eventually be a thing[comment]Yang needs to run in the House or Senate.  We need Dems in Congress.
[comment]Yang‚Äôs campaign was too intellectual for this country and reading many of these comments proves that. It‚Äôs not that people are dumb and can not understand what he was saying because thinking that would contradict everything he stands for - but people aren‚Äôt used to a candidate who so deeply cares about fundamentally changing the way this country operates from how we measure economic success to how we engage with local communities to how we understand mental health and much much more. Yang stood for a better tomorrow and be believed in that. He has now fundamentally changed political rhetoric in this country and reopened the political sphere to normal Americans. It was hard to say goodbye but he really did shake things up and I‚Äôm so grateful for that. 

We NEED more people like Yang in this country and I hope he finds a way to stay acutely involved (cmon Bernie - you know what to do). 

Bernie bro in 2016 and I‚Äôm ready to return to his cause but never will I forget how an Asian man who likes math inspired me to think harder and want a truly happy country. Yang brought new ideas to the table - let‚Äôs not let them go too quickly.
[comment]He wasn't a bad guy and had he succeeded[comment]Best candidate in the race by far. It‚Äôs a sad day.
[comment]What an idiot people were just starting to talk about him.      God the DFL has some lame fucking candidates.

[comment]*Full text if paywalled for you; written by Fintan O‚ÄôToole*:

Over more than two centuries
However bad things are for most other rich democracies
Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming
As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic
It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster
The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisisdemonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge
If the plague is a test
Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil
It is hard to remember now but
What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump ‚Äì he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility
Thus
In Florida
Georgia governor Brian Kemp
This is not mere ignorance ‚Äì it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is
It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories
Trump embodies and enacts this mindset
The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump‚Äôs statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has ‚Äútotal authority‚Äù
But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump‚Äôs presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it.

There are very powerful interests who demand ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in order to do as they like with the environment
Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself
And the president
That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US ‚Äì it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening
And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017
As things get worse
Either way[comment]I'm a single issue voter....

Donald Trump's philosophy is

If at first you don't succeed
Lie
Everybody lies
And
Why do people keep forgetting this.

When you tell a lie you insult the intelligence of the person you are lying to and you destroy your own credibility.

**When Donald Trump lies he destroys America's credibility
**AND HE INSULTS THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOU
as they are the only ones who still believe what he says.

[title]Anti-Trump conservative group[selftext]https://www.newsweek.com/anti-trump-conservative-group-led-george-conway-rick-wilson-endorses-joe-biden-1496968[comment]Cross-aisle[comment]My hope is that this group does real damage to Trump over time.  I think most people can agree that 1) adults need to be in charge of the country; and 2) a good faith opposition party is good for democracy overall.  Trump and Trumpism need to be destroyed in order for those to happen.  It's useful to have Republican operatives as allies who are well-versed in the "dark arts."

He's not a real conservative.
[comment]Yeah no shit they endorsed Joe Biden[comment]Biden is going to lose badly. The DNC does it again. What a fucking joke.

[comment]What if they passed some sort of executive order extending his term? it appears executive orders can override the Constitution so....
[comment]That is going to be a very nervous few weeks
[comment]On January 21st Trump will be just an ex-President without power no matter what he wants. The only way for him to stay in office would be to change the Constitution or overthrow the government. If he were to throw a tantrum and refuse to leave he would be escorted out by the Sargent of arms. He‚Äôll have as much right to sit in the Oval Office as you or I unless one of us is elected President.
[comment]He could refuse to leave office.
[comment]Trump will just appoint himself "Acting President" like he has done to skirt every other position.
[comment]You can rely on the fact that he will definitely try. Let's not rule out the right-wing SCOTUS Judges getting involved on his behalf either before or after the election.

Edit: Spelling and grammar

[comment]Promise?
[comment]marketwatch trying to jinx us
[comment]When people say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get complacent and don‚Äôt trust the polls‚Äù - correct them by saying:

‚ÄúRun up the score on the gop.  Vote your ass off!‚Äù - it uses positivity and optimism as the catalyst to vote and look forward vs. using fear.
[comment]Do not get complacent!
[comment]OH and NC[comment][This](https://www.270towin.com/maps/0mjkZ)is my prediction as of now.
[comment]Look realistically he lost by over three million votes last time and still here we are. So nobody get any kind of hope until 2024 and even then he's probably going to win again
[comment]Ignore this[comment]VOTE and make sure your friends do too.
[comment]That would explain why the Democrat states are against opening up "and I thought it was because they were saving lives". 
The economy will thrive and you all know it.
[comment]In normal times with a candidate who could tie his own shoes maybe.
[comment]I really hope this ages well
[comment]Sad that he doesn't face historic defeat irrespective of the economy[comment]Doesn't matter. Campaign and vote as if we were 5 points down in every state.
[comment]This is not an accurate interpretation. They are looking at these number and drawing conclusions based on the unemployment rate and other economic statistics[comment]If Trump loses we will not know whether he truly lost until December 14 when the electoral votes in each state have to be certified. Trump being Trump he will sue the heck out of the states[comment]PA isn't flipping
Covid is certainly not damaging Repubs here. They let the problem get so bad it takes drastic political action just to sort of flatten the curve and then blame it on "government" and people eat it up[comment]God I hope it‚Äôs right. I just remember the trauma of 2016 when all the polls showed Hilary was ahead and then afterwards I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed.

[comment]I don't see how Arizona doesn't flip blue. "Let old people die to save the economy" isn't real popular with all the old people here. Also Kelly should crush Mcsally.
[comment]Didn‚Äôt we get complacent in 2016
Trump only faces defeat if we VOTE. Polling does nothing but give people false hope that we‚Äôve won. PLEASE VOTE AND DON‚ÄôT BE COMPLACENT.

Biden needs to beat Trump electorally.  In 2016
[Trump Leads Biden in the States He Won in 2016: Campaign Update] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/biden-urges-protesters-to-harness-their-rage-campaign-update?srnd=premium&amp;sref=YjKZ1f32)

Biden needs to beat Trump overwhelmingly to show Republicans that this country wants none of the Republican bullshit.
[comment]Bull$hit. Anyone remember this?  [Hillary has a 93% chance of winning](https://i.imgur.com/gaQLSFW.jpg)
[comment]We need to beat trump in a landslide. Everyone has to vote. If we only beat him by anything less than 10% they will attempt to invalidate the election and start a civil war. Everyone in every town across America needs to vote against him and all republicans. Only then will we find peace.
[comment]Run. Up. The. Score.

Keep fighting until January 20[comment]All he has to do is smile and not say anything and he should win.
[comment]Just thought I‚Äôd remind you guys that Hillary was supposed to have the same sort of lead in the polls
[comment]Only if we vote for him! Go Joe!
[comment]This is still way to low. Its actually fucking depressing.
[comment]It don‚Äôt matter if we don‚Äôt vote. Vote. Vote. Vote.
[comment]I don‚Äôt care. VOTE
[comment]Let's wirk harder to a point that Biden be 80%ahead of TRUMP...let's not make same mistake of 2016
[comment]Polls don't matter. Vote
[comment]That lead aint big enough
[comment]Not good enough. Run up the score. Lets beat him by 20 points and humiliate the fuck out of Trump.
[comment]I'm not very enthusiastic about voting for Biden (seems like a nice guy just super out of touch) but I will. Same as I did for Hillary. I really wish the Democratic party could come up with better candidates.
[comment]Trump isn't even trying to be a real President[comment]This isn't just about Republicans either[comment]Got to keep it up! Have to spot Trump at least 5 points[comment]Trump's not completely stupid -- he's trying to start a civil war because it's basically his only chance. Barr's going to help him round up his enemies[comment]Don't get cocky folks[comment]And yet[comment]Remember when Hillary had a 20-point lead. These polls are jokes
[comment]We must VOTE to make this happen! Believe no polls. And it has to be a landslide so that Trump cannot refuse to leave OUR White House.
[comment]Compared to 2 points two months ago. Holy shit
[comment]I would like a moratorium on all posts about Biden being ahead. If every single one of our blue asses doesn't turn up in November[comment]Obligatory and unnecessary: "don't be complacent" and "I hate polls like this. We have to get busy"
[comment]Remember nov 2016 and the distortion that could be caused by electoral college system. It is not popular vote based election and Russian government is helping him. 
Don‚Äôt be overly confident on this.
[comment]DONT TRUST THE POLLS! REMEMBER 2016? PLEASE VOTE!
[comment]More importantly a poll came out with Biden up +6 in Michigan.
[comment]Polls don't mean shit.
Except the one taken on November 3rd.
[comment]Didn't hillary have more than a ten point lead at times prior to the 2016 election??

Fuck these polls.

Vote.
[comment]Keep him hidden and don't let him talk. We need to remove Trump[comment]Just VOTE! PLEASE!! I don't want to see the US turn into an authoritarian dictatorship.
[comment]Let‚Äôs not get cocky!
[comment]Biden will gain some ground the next few months albeit slowly.  Luckily we get to replace one asshole with another - yet a lesser asshole.
[comment]I remember when Hillary couldn't lose.

I give to Joe's campaign EVERY WEEK because I know this will be a hard fight all the way to the end and maybe even after.

There's a reason Trump had Rudy Giuliani do what he did in the Ukraine: he didn't want to face Joe Biden in the Fall.  Getting Biden out of the way was the goal that made him impeachable.  

Because it always goes back to Donald Trump.
[comment]With the amount of love Wall Street had for HRC and Bill I think they are not the savior that we had hoped for. The reality is no political party is in a position to deal with this. The closest thing would be what this party calls a revolution that no one wants. 

A question that I felt like they missed in the debate and the thing Biden keeps talking about when asked about Yang (not the MATH). He says Yang has a vision for the next industrial revolution and it is upon us. That should maybe be the focus. I know we fear that airlines going BK is bad. Instead of infusing money into the corporations that are profit over people we should maybe hear what Yang is thinking is coming

[comment]The irony is that after all the years of being demonized by GOP she emerges as a central force in guiding the investigation in to abuse of presidential power.

But the president is just the tip of the iceberg - the figurehead - of a greater problem. We have the president we have because of a failure of the GOP to provide any other alternative. If for no other reason than by omission the party allowed Trump to be the standard bearer for the party. But in reality he is just a red herring
Time for a change.

[comment]Winning the war of public opinion is very important however. Republicans prove this with their endless smear campaigns and frankly Democrats need to fight fire with fire more often.

[comment]I mean it's also the purity tests. Warren supporters hold every other candidate to impossible standards while deriding everything they don't like about their candidate as an unfair attack. Her cultish populism scares me.

[comment]Yeah[comment]It‚Äôs not activism
Some people/institutions should absolutely get roasted all the time in every context imaginable.
[comment]but[comment]The Twitter verse simply needs to be ignored.
[comment]Then publicly shaming them in real life isn't activism either. But that's what protests are and you can literally do both.

Because that's how free speech works.

It does count as activism[comment]No shit. Young progressive twitter‚Äôs ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is beyond stupid and the most any of them will ever do for political activism.

Gabbard is human trash. The Indian party- BJP- that supports her lost again in New Delhi today because they‚Äôre xenophobic farright sycophants.

Am I missing something?

[comment]What ‚Äî legislators did something sensible? I think I finally landed in a universe I can enjoy!
[comment]My mother belongs on /r/insanepeoplefacebook. She said this is a precursor to the left coming to take all of our guns away.

She's a midwesterner who has transplanted to florida and is semi-retired. She lives in a boomer echo chamber where any mention of removing statues or removing public adoration for the confederacy is somehow the left planning a takeover and indoctrination. It's downright looney.

I got tagged in one of these where she was all "see"? 

I typed in a public post that both Obama and Clinton each had 8 years to take our guns and couldn't even get that done. Gosh[comment]I have a feeling this could enrage Republicans and turn state red again OR (if enough people vote) state could be blue for a long time.
[comment]Yup yup. Yup. Hopefully passed before 2020
[comment]Good.  Election Day should be a day off nationwide.
[comment]Well good for Virginia!!! Now can the rest of the country do the same for election day?!?!
[comment]Its unfortunate that people such as myself still won't get this holiday off work. But this is a huge step in the right direction.

Is/Was Lee-Jackson Day a day people get off work in Virginia? I didn't think so. 

I don't predict this is going to make too many people angry except maybe in rural areas? Now[comment]Robert E Lee is a goddamn hero. He could not bring himself to fight against his homestate of Virginia.

The Civil War was fought over slavery

There is no record of any Confederate general protesting that illegal order. Lee never tried to stop his men from murdering blacks they caught.

Robert E Lee and Stonewall jackson are war criminals. That's your heritage.

[comment]Unfortunately there are millions either part of the Trump cult or millions who can't admit they were wrong.  We will never change them.  We  just have to GOTV for the Democratic candidate on Tuesday[comment]Trump is Palpatine and Bernie is Yoda.  That makes Pence a cardboard cutout of Vader.
[comment]I don't agree that we should just permanently cancel every Trump voter. Winning the general and making progress is important
If we were going to blame people we shouldn't blame people for voting wrong
But we shouldn't blame people at all[comment]At least 3 million Americans would heartily agree üßî
[comment]DAMN RIGHT!!!!!  DAMN STRAIGHT!!!!!
[comment]Knee jerk progressive disagrees.
[comment]So now "better than Trump" is a talking point. Diaper rash is better than Trump.
[comment]I could never figure out that line especially from democrats.  It had everything to do with stacking the courts.  By not voting Clinton they basically allowed trump to destroy the courts for the next 30 years.
[comment]Just a reminder: If you think either "side" of your government has your/the peoples best interests at heart[comment]Hillary isn't perfect
Hillary knows that as long as you're passing laws people want and that help them

Saying that if you think ‚Äúthis‚Äù then you‚Äôre a moron to whom no one should listen about anything ever again[comment]Well. Yea. But it seems that we are the only people who are awake to this idea. The entire Republican Party seems to be entirely brainwashed. It‚Äôs actually truly sad.

[comment]Media: Oh look at the 42 things Trump has done
Also media: Wow no idea why everyone downplayed the guy?! 

It's like putting toy commercials on cartoons it seems and wondering why the children pick that certain toy that they see over and over and over again.
[comment]Most of the mainstream media didn't turn her into a caricature. That was the conservative pundits[comment]I agree with one statement. She definitely hasn't changed.
[comment]The mass media are controlled by the consumers
How do you get accurate information?  Use multiple sources and pick those that are not slaves to consumer fads.  NPR.  BBC.  Christian Science Monitor.  The Economist
[comment]The media hasn't changed at all.  It serves power.

It pretended Trump was a legitimate candidate
It pretended Hillary Clinton was some kind of opposite equivalent of Trump
It pretended Trump was "elected
And now it's pretending other things in preparation to see Glorious Leader For Life Trump installed in power forever.
[comment]I have to say Hillary for bad press. But she didn‚Äôt help by not being genuine. She has always been very closed off and lacked self reflection. She came off as cold because she campaigned not to lose instead of campaigned to win. 

For better or for worse presidential politics is a cult of personality. The presidents of the last 40 years have been the person who presented as being a genuine person and showed their personality
Clinton presented as stiff. And her lack of interviews didn‚Äôt help. She is doing more candid interviews now.
[comment]Listen to her interview with Howard Stern from 2019. If THAT Hillary had run she would have easily been president. I liked her before. I loved her after.
[comment]I always felt that her unlikeability was always a third party branding that worked really well.
[comment]The fake propoganda machine on the right made her out to be evil like Trump tries to do with everyone that opposes him.   How much better of a president would she be than the current one....
[comment]It's totally irrelevant whether she's likeable or not. What matter are policies and ideology.
[comment]I think that's only half right. By keeping Hillary on a tight leash[comment]Thank you ‚ÄºÔ∏è
[comment]Amen. It's unreal to me how the press turned her into some sort of monster.

When she says that people generally dislike her when she's running for something[comment]It's amazing to me how many people on the left still think all the debunked garbage about Hillary is true and call her "evil".
[comment]But none of those were major party presidential nominees. I am not saying all politicians have that skill.

"Polls" in general are pretty unreliable[comment]only half? well[comment]That seems low but then again he is the Commander in Chief* so there may be some active duty personnel that feel compelled to voice approval without actually feeling that way.

[comment]The reason that Trump can‚Äôt say what he thinks the crime was is because it would be ‚ÄúObama improperly tried to get dirt on a political rival to influence an election.‚Äù

Which is what Trump was impeached for.

He also can‚Äôt say it because Obama didn‚Äôt do that‚Äînone of this information came out prior to the election.

[comment]Sue them into insolvency.

It's literally a convo between Joy Reid and Gabe Sherman....that means nothing.

If you think somebody who‚Äôs already thinking that Trump is getting railroaded by partisan Democrats is going to change their tune when they read that they‚Äôre not passing the articles on to the House
It was a great move to impeach Trump. It needed to be done. But this won‚Äôt help anything and could make his base even more energized come November.

Let's fight for a fair trail.
[comment]Another advantage is that the senators running for president on the Democratic side will be able to focus on their campaigns and not have to deal with the hearings.
[comment]I dont need to read the article to know it is brilliant.  She is a genius! Old Moscow Mitch sure doesn't like getting his own treatment! She has them all going ballistic and it is a wonderful thing to behold.  I hope she holds them articles as long as Mitch held up Garland.
[comment]If Mitch McConnell stubs a toe three times a day he wouldn't really notice it because elves feet are very callous.
[comment]Trump and the GOP were complaining since day one that he wasn't getting a fair trial[comment]The House should look into Trump's emoluments violations and tack that article of impeachment on to the list in 2020. They can deliver *all* the articles of impeachment to the Republican Senate some time in 2020 when it's most inconvenient for them.
[comment]Are we sure this is it and not an attempt to sabotage Bernie and Warrens campaigning efforts in Iowa right before the state caucuses?  Just sayin worth a thought. Convenient that Biden and Pete would be helped by this.
[comment]Maybe the hold up has something to do with the Supreme court having to hear his appeals in the three cases on March 2020.
[comment]Color me skeptical.  Mitch and Trump aren't rational or moral.  They will gladly pretend like there is no impeachment as long as the articles aren't delivered.

The Democrats are the ones that wanted to push things through by the end of the year.  Trump and company were glad to let the courts settle things[comment]California 2020 Election

[title]If you watch Trump this week he looks dejected[selftext]https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/fjshln/if_you_watch_trump_this_week_he_looks_dejected_as/[comment]He will eventually die a bitter mumbling old man with only paid sycophants around him pretending they care.
[comment]He has the virus and looks sick
[comment]He hasn't even ONCE mentioned having any sympathies for the people afflicted with COVID-19 or have lost a loved one.  The man is severely emotionally/intellectually/developmentally impaired and fails as a leader.
[comment]Coping means you have a strength that enables  holding on. 
Trump is weak. He isn't coping. Ivanka tells him  he is. He isn't. I look forward to the bastard completely losing his ****.
[comment]Trump is completely unprepared
[comment]I will die before trump voluntarily resigns. He has way too much of an ego to ever do that
[comment]The fastest response  ever since Obama left him in such bad shape.
[comment]He's the ultimate ghoul.
[comment]I think he just realized that he can't tweet his way out of the Corona pandemic
[comment]Put a moron in charge[comment]We need a Mensch.
[comment]It's insane how awful things have gotten to the point that Pence being President would be a huge relief. At least he is literate and capable of taking in new information. But it could be the difference between millions of deaths and tens of millions of deaths worldwide[comment]He can't resign because he'll be subject to finance crimes in NY state. He needs to win so the statute of limitations runs out and he can't be prosecuted.
[comment]Id respect him 100% more if he resigned.
[comment]Being President aged Barrack like 20 years. Even when you are doing the worst possible job you can do it probably is stressful. When you have to rate yourself you are stressed and lonely.
[comment]He gave himself a 10 out of 10! He's perfect guys. He never makes mistakes. He is the bestest wisest most biggest hands smarts most stable genius ever. His uncle went to MIT so it runs in the family and he has a natural talent for biochemistry so Trump will formulate the cure soon!
[comment]If we really look at this. Tariffs led to a protein shortage in China forcing the market to offer protein alternatives like wild meat. Ok the Chinese government banned imports from the US in the midst of a swine Ebola that removed millions of Chinese swine from the markets. The US banned certain imports from China. Thankfully not trump ties or Ivanka hand bags but the Chinese reaction did impact imports of US pork to China hence leading to the ‚Äúwild meats‚Äù in local Chinese markets. So in a convoluted way our fearful leader is ultimately completely responsible. But rated his response a 10 when he is solely in a large part responsible for the mess we find ourselves in.
[comment]It would be nice if we could focus on substance rather than aesthetics. Trump's policies and appointments have always been where 99% of the harm originated[comment]You are right. 

I remember a coworker had a saying : "Lead[comment]Hello[comment]Completely devoid of empathy?!??! Come on. If he was up there apologizing all the time and offering sympathies[comment]Let's stop calling our elected officials "leaders" please.  They're representatives.  Let's vote for representatives please.
[comment]Donald Dump
[comment]Exactly what I was saying the whole time. He doesn't even care about his base. He can watch his supporters burn alive and wont bat an eye while counting the bills in his wallet.  

So if he doesn't care about his base
To be honest
But I just want someone who isn't dismissive
In my personal opinion
But I feel like the reason why it hasn't happened yet is because political party clashing prevents anything from happening and thus now no one can see who's ideas are better for the country. 

Am I wrong? Don't we all want to achieve the same goal which is make a better life for people? What middle ground is possible?
[comment]He sees the writing on the wall. Even he knows he fumbled this one in his own end zone. The universe literally gave him an opportunity to be a hero as we have no choice but to look to our government right now. Except he set himself up for failure so hard and he can‚Äôt actually handle it so he‚Äôll forever be cemented as an absolute failure even to the people that didn‚Äôt wanna believe it before. And he‚Äôll have no way of rationalizing it in his head either.
[comment]Exactly[comment]Why does he look dejected[comment]All he cares about is the market.  He is deluded when he says "there's tremendous pent up demand" and that will somehow magically make everything better.  Never mind that only 50% have any stock market exposure at all
Meanwhile in a month or two there will be countless millions who haven't worked in weeks and with so many Americans going pay check to pay check they will have no money for food and have to resort to begging or soup kitchens.  Rent payments will not be made
Even worse people will be dying in droves because they are sick at home and can't get to hospital and even if they could the hospitals are full and have so few respirators that 90% of those needing them will be triaged to die. Many
And there Trump sits[comment]He was outclassed by the job on day one.
Ref- trumps comments - exiting day 1 briefing
[comment]I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say he and Pence are absolutely tired to the brink of exhaustion and terrified about this virus. He has a lot of lives in his hands and he knows it. Show some sympathy.
[comment]Saying can't stand the man is an understatement for me. He walked into a relative slam dunk of decent economy[comment]He‚Äôs not feeling well because he has it..... he hasn‚Äôt been getting his spray tans so he is looking pale
[comment]Pelosi for President. Pence and Trump gotta go together.
[comment]Is anyone else CONVINCED he is lying about his negative test result?! 
I think he ‚Äúcares‚Äù all of a sudden because it‚Äôs impacted him personally. He can‚Äôt see past his own nose so either he or one of his kids had tested positive. I‚Äôd bet my hat!
[comment]This is because Fox News is telling him it is bad.  Not because the CDC or WHO[comment]Keep Trump in office please[comment]True he is onky thinking about himself n hus REELECTION but nonabout the american lives...A demagogue took the world in the 20 century and in the 21 century another took U.S. to its knees

[comment]So the Russians silenced the black vote in 2016? This article misses the mark by a decent margin.  Hillary Clinton was uninspiring and heavily flawed.  That's why black millennials voted third party or stayed home.

Even Republicans have said that they would have voted for Tulsi Gabbard...but no you all HAD to have Biden.  Hell I am a Trumper and even I would have thought twice if it was between those two.

She is :.

1. A veteran ( republicans \*\*love this\*\* )
2. Suspended her campaign to serv and then restarted once she was back from duty ( republicans have wet dreams about a candidate like this!\*\* )
3. She is young and fit4. She some supported limits on abortion ( Again5. Does not like foreign wars after having to actually be in a warzone as a marine.

Compare those thoughts to Biden or Bernie.

[comment]Because there were less jobs to create. We have more jobs than people[comment]But it still created jobs right ?
[comment]No surprise[comment]Why don't you compare Obama's first 3 years with trumps last 3 years
[comment]Obama's 1st 3 years we lost jobs.......

[title]Obama to endorse Biden for president today
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/politics/obama-endorses-biden/index.html[comment]This is a big fucking deal!
[comment]**Here is the text for those who dont want to click the link**    

&gt;(CNN)Former President Barack Obama will endorse Joe Biden on Tuesday
&gt;Obama will make the endorsement of his former vice president in a video message
&gt;The endorsement reunites the former running mates and positions Obama
&gt;It also marks the public re-emergence of Obama into the political arena. The former president kept a low public profile throughout much of the Democratic nomination fight
&gt;Two people familiar with Obama's video say it is intended as more than a simple endorsement of his friend and former vice president. His message is designed to address this particular moment in America and around the world
&gt;Obama will acknowledge how frightened people are and explain why he believes Biden is the right person to lead the country in this time of crisis
&gt;Obama will also speak directly to progressives
&gt;Obama in November said he had spoken to all of the candidates during the campaign
&gt;Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race

&gt;"We have a field of very accomplished
&gt;Obama had long said he would get behind the eventual nominee
&gt;That relationship
&gt;As Sanders worked to determine the future of his campaign
&gt;"We need you in the White House. I will do all that I can to see that that happens
&gt;In the few moments where Obama did speak out about the race
&gt;And the former president told the candidates to avoid going so far left that they go beyond where voters actually are.

&gt;"My one cautionary note is I think it is very important for all the candidates who are running at every level to pay some attention to where voters actually are
&gt;It is this period of the campaign
&gt;"He is uniquely positioned to galvanize the party around the nominee and increase voter turnout so that a Democrat is successful in the general election
&gt;Jarrett said that they believed it was "important" to let all the candidates "stand on their own two feet" but that once a nominee was selected
&gt;Obama's popularity inside the Democratic Party was clear throughout the presidential campaign. A number of candidates ran ads featuring either images of Obama or the former president's voice
&gt;But the extent with which Obama can reach out to Sanders' supports is questionable
&gt;Biden was not shy about his admiration for Obama throughout the 2020 campaign. Biden often described himself as an "Obama-Biden" Democrat and
&gt;The former vice president even used part of his first major rally as a presidential candidate in 2019 to laud his former boss as "an extraordinary man."

&gt;"I watched up close
&gt;This story is breaking and will be updated.

[selftext]https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/bloomberg-and-the-black-vote-in-2020.html[comment]Because it worked?
[comment]The answer is because African American and Latino communities are able to accept his apology and see the bigger context and all the good he has done for people of color. These are the same reasons Ralph Northman is still governor of Virginia and Justin Trudeau is still prime minister of Canada.
[comment]I have to say there's something morbidly and horrifyingly funny about African Americans supporting a man who implemented a policy more race targeted than the 90s crime bill :/.
[comment]Slightly off topic but bloomberg got nothing in iowa. 

Nothing in nh.. was he even on the ballot? 

Is polling at basically nothing in sc and nev. 

What's the goal here? Its looking like we're going to be 4 races in him finishing under yang and steyer in all of them. 

He's looking completley unviable.
[comment]Replacing one rich billionaire with another is not the answer. The only place bloomberg belongs is on the chopping block if he ends up getting trump reelected

[comment]Bet she's getting "concerned" now probably on the verge of being "troubled"
[comment]This is a good sign but I would like to see the gap a little bit larger because I would imagine Susan Collins is going to have a huge advantage in terms of name recognition than her opponent.
[comment]I thought she said she would retire!?

[comment]Come on Maine vote Susan Collins out of office maybe she'll have to take a perp walk from the Senate just like they made the good man lieutenant colonel vidman do from the White House. If Susan Collins does take a perp walk there's a real reason for it unlike lieutenant colonel vidman he didn't deserve what he got nor did his brother or anyone else involved in the impeachment of the orange man / orangutan.

[comment]Clear as Kushner.
[comment]He has no legal authority. None. 
The election doesn‚Äôt need his commitment to happen. 

That being said you can already see what POTUS is trying to do with his comments regarding mail in ballots not being allowed to count. 
The GOP and POTUS are going to try everything they can to maintain their power. The courts are going to be busy ruling on a lot of proposed voter suppression related tactics that the GOP will use to disenfranchise voters. This is a calculated plan on their behalf.
[comment]WTF? The federal government doesn‚Äôt control the elections nor when the president has to leave office.

[comment]Yeah Kushner I am going to need you fuck to the off right about now.
[comment]If the election doesn‚Äôt go forward as planned trumps term expires anyway and Nancy Pelosi becomes president. Trump doesn‚Äôt have the authority to stop this election so Kushner certainly can‚Äôt do anything.
[comment]The election must occur if he wants a chance of staying in office as if it doesn't then the president and his vice president are removed from office anyways by the constitution automatically.
[comment]Kushner is more or less the president right now. The next AG needs to scrutinize every single action this dip dingle has done in the last few years.

I was pretty sure the deadline is written into the constitution. There is no question about what happens if somebody were to cross the deadline. Not sure why Kushner is not taking a deadline like that serious. Crossing a deadline like that cannot end well. Americans take our deadlines very serious.
[comment]He looks like the mannequin with makeup on to make him look human

[comment]Why does Trump HATE Americans so very much?
[comment]In all honesty these cuts should pass. The majority of his base and red states will suffer while the majority of blue states will find a solution to take care of its citizens. 

The only bad thing is republitards will start a massive influx migration to blue states. Then they will demand changes in democrat local governments trying to have what they ran from.

[selftext]https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/01/pete-buttigieg-enrages-left-liberals-2020-091479[comment]This is interesting and actually makes me like him a bit more. Mayor Pete maddens me because of the last election. It makes me crazy that a man can get this far with no experience. Of course the ass we have as our president now also has no experience but is that what we are going for?
[comment]This article comes close to realizing the point and then misses it completely.  It‚Äôs about some left-right spectrum.  It‚Äôs about money in politics.
[comment]The young left does not trust those whose campaigns are largely financed by Wall Street. Any other young lefties are welcome to chime in.
[comment]Because he's a bought and paid for political hack[comment]Why &lt;Anyone not named Bernie Sanders&gt; Enrages the Young Left.

Literally put any candidate name in this title and the result is the same.  It's why the young left tore down Kamala with Racist and Sexist lies and attacks.  It's why they tear down Warren.  It's why they tell lies about Biden.  It's why Sander's supporter gleefully went all in on Pizzagate
Just look at the people posting shit about Pete in r/politics and here.  Look at their histories.  They did the same thing with every candidate
It's not Pete
I have yet to see anyone Prove that Pete's funding is from "wall street"
But luckily
The "young left" are mentally diminished malcontents that simply worship a messiah.  It's sick.  They are no different from Trump supporters.

It's all about their messiah and the cult of hate they belong too.  If Buttigeig falls in the polls and someone else rises[comment]I think the huge privilege that Pete Buttigieg has that no one mentions is his Christianity and Military Service. Both of these things are often used by the right wing (and many centrists) as a way to indicate who the ‚Äúreal Americans‚Äù are. 

Military service (prior to the repeal of DADT) is incompatible with an open and honest life for LGBT folks
Christianity is literally the enemy of LGBT folks
I feel like Pete Buttigieg is a huge sellout to the LGBT community. We do not need to be veterans or Christians to have a seat at the table. If people can‚Äôt accept us for who we are[comment]Because he is a gentleman.. and that form of masculinity has gone out of vogue.

[comment]I remember Stop and Frisk.  Not gonna vote for him.

But.  This did make my opinion of him[comment]I have my opinions of Bloomberg but he deserves credit for this if he follows through. Trump has to go
[comment]I will be voting for him in the primary.
[comment]Gonna need all the money the dems can get. Sux that campaigns are run on money but look at how much foreign ruble Trump has gained.
[comment]I mean I love this. We can use all the help we can get[comment]good on him
[comment]I agree with other posters I have my own thoughts on Mike Bloomberg[comment]Didnt he use prison labor as a call center? Could this play just be to get good PR?
[comment]Bernie would never
[comment]No campaign should accept.
[comment]Translation: If I can't buy my way into the presidency[comment]Im just happy this is bugging the shit out of the dummy.
[comment]Does this asshole do anything besides write checks? That‚Äôs his solution to every problem.
[comment]Anything to get more votes.
[comment]We‚Äôll see about that
[comment]What I like about Bloomberg is that he hasn't smeared or attacked any of the other Democrats. He's focused on Trump.
[comment]Compare Michael Bloomberg to Shelton Addelson who got a 600 million dollar tax cut and immediately kicked back 100 million dollars to the Republican Party.
[comment]Bernie Sanders has entered the chat.
[comment]If this is/stays true Bloomberg just became my current #2. Now I just need to research his policies.
[comment]Whoever? Let's pick any Democratic thing[comment]$100 says he goes back on this promise after Bernie wins the nomination.
[comment]Cool[comment]This is the first and only respectable thing Bloomberg has ever done. 

Let‚Äôs hope he actually pulls through and isn‚Äôt talking out of his ass. You know[comment]Trump keeps proving that he is the best president[comment]Bernie in the house!
[comment]I wonder if Bernie or Warren would accept his support
[comment]Uhhhh. That works I guess?

Could have put the money toward that without wasting it on his own run[comment]We have got to get Trump out of office. Let's take the help.
[comment]He could do this without running too.
[comment]I seriously[comment]I hope the party rallies behind whoever the nominee is...
[comment]buying elections is wrong in any form.
[comment]Vote BLUE no matter who!
[comment]Well... I guess that answers the question I heard posed on MSNBC the other night.

[comment]Haven't you heard though? He doesn't agree that we have the most cases. Problem solved[comment]Yeah[comment]HA! You don't that every country is as honest with the figures do you?
[comment]I mean[comment]Extremely hard to believe China's numbers though.
[comment]Most countries do not test much though.
[comment]Orange don't listen[comment]That‚Äôs because we are testing more and actually reporting numbers. If you think we have higher numbers than China you are sorely mistaken. Stop spreading misinformation. Now downvote me.
[comment]china is lying[comment]Tiger blood# winning #coffefe
[comment]This is true for confirmed cases but cases are going massively underreported in numerous places like Ecuador[comment]36% of known cases.
[comment]Hey is this garbage upvoted? It‚Äôs very clear that China has the most cases.

[comment]Only a scumbag with no conscience would use this crisis for his own political gain. But we already knew he is a scumbag[comment]Guess what...Trump does not give a damn!
He personifies the worst of american society and we put him in charge. He is all those thugish things we despise but due to our hipocrisy we pretend we don't care. With others it is the end of the worldWe have to vote better next time[comment]Why is this narrative being peddled daily?  No way we have the most cases.  We just happen to report what we have truthfully. 

Stop with these threads. Waste of time on every level.
[comment]Would Trump administration develop more effective countermeasures had we known the real numbers from China early on?  In order to ask this question[comment]The Obama administration walked incoming Trump administration officials through a hypothetical scenario in which a pandemic worse than the 1918 Spanish flu shut down cities like Seoul and London in early 2017
During the briefing[comment]To be fair[comment]https://i.redd.it/xi6jq0ldxst41.jpg
[comment]Using this site to make political points is stupid regardless of your political standing.  


I hate Trump with all my  heart but please refrain from using countries self reported statistics as evidence of anything. There are obviously alot of lies coming from plenty of countries. Deaths are reported differently (for example I read in Swedish news recently that UK

And even so

Please stop making these stupid attempts of political points. If you want to make people change their minds about Trump make valid ones[comment]Amen on a grandiose scale!!! He seems to think if he just screams stuff looking and loud enough we'll all start to believe it! I cannot even believe he still talks About "winning "when the death toll is over 30[comment]He must not be reelected or selected. Can't happen. Words defy me with this one...
[comment]According to a recent Stanford study

[comment]No kidding.  I am so sick of Trump.  He has to lose in November.  The guy is a walking stack of bullshit.  I don't think and Republican has the right to complain about Benghazi ever again.  The way Trump has handled the coronavirus is worse.

The GOP is not a political party.  It's a Russian-backed
Until Democrats figure that out[comment]Graham can jump on that train as well[comment]That‚Äôs like saying there‚Äôs honor among thieves .

[comment]Even with Chief Justice Roberts overseeing the Senate trial with rules set by Republicans during the Clinton impeachment[comment]They need to send this to an actual trial with judge and jurors picked from American voters. Otherwise it will be a sham just like they are saying.
[comment]Moscow Mitch doesn't give a shit about an oath.
[comment]Republicans already said that they don't plan on even pretending to do this fairly or to be unbiased.  They will not recuse themselves[comment]Good. Democrats need to be running ads on TV calling out this disgraceful behavior. Republicans villainized Pelosi[comment]The whole impeachment is a big sham IMO.

[comment]Shit-hole country
[comment]Everyones favorite Democrat up to 2016. You reap what you show[comment]I highly doubt that Trump is going to debate the Democratic nominee. Not that there's any point to it. Biden will tear Trump apart but the Trumpettes will claim Doni Boy won. It's what they do.
[comment]If he gets re-elected[comment]He finally made a speech (Mar 14 noon est) where he did not shift blame or attack any democrats

He still only thanks his loyalists - but he mentioned "and working with Nancy Pelosi" but did not thank her.

Just curious if bill passed contained  any sneaky things not related to Coronavirus
[comment]Dems should censure him for his lies and the fucking media needs to stop saying "that's false" because when you know something is false and willfully state it as true that's what the rest of us call a goddamn lie.

Another reason to throw a few bucks towards PBS.  Asking the tough questions.

[comment]The World Health Organization had working tests that the United States refused

He does not care about the well being of Americans. He only cares about himself and his image. And now we are all paying the price for Trump's stupidity. UGH.
[comment]For those of you who want to read an interesting post[comment]For those of you who want to read an interesting post[comment]Of course the orange idiot denies it.....he can‚Äôt ever admit he did anything wrong.

[comment]How can he possibly be re-elected[comment]Just a note
[Texas has vote by mail.](https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/reqabbm.shtml)

To be eligible to vote early by mail in Texas
* **be 65 years or older;**
* be disabled;
* be out of the county on election day and during the period for early voting by * personal appearance; or
* be confined in jail
Republicans are afraid.
[comment]And if we retake the White House and Senate
- Expand the size of the House of Representatives- Admit several if not all of the territories as states. +2 Dem senators for each one you add.

The short-term effect is a prolonged Democratic majority to begin undoing the damage of the Republicans since the Reagan administration. 

The long-term effect[comment]We know
[comment]This isn‚Äôt true. Instead what would happen is that the Republican Party would be forced to adapt
Although I‚Äôm probably just being pedantic here.
[comment]Parties would adjust their program. A two part system always converges to 50/50. Just like two ice cream sellers always end up next to eachother in the middle of a beach. 

See: Pareto optimum.
Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a situation that cannot be modified so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off.¬†
[comment]You would NEVER in a million years have to twist his words to make him look bad. He's his own worst enemy. He's lucky his base is not very bright. That's definitely a huge plus for him because everything he says goes right over their heads[comment]Remember when he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about controlling the narrative
I think that was something they told him behind closed doors and they forgot to tell him to not say it out loud.
[comment]This has been known for years 
That's why the Republicans try to make it so hard to vote.
 
Can somebody explain this to Trump[comment]I think he's trying to insinuate that people who vote Democrat are lazy.
[comment]Because of voter fraud. You didn‚Äôt finish it. Republicans for some reason assume the best in people.
[comment]Sounds like BS.
[comment]I don‚Äôt think any republicans have ever refuted this. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been working so hard to suppress voting rights.

[comment]Fun fact..for all the network's flaws[comment]Pathetic that there are his zombie goose-stepping followers will all nod their head in agreement. Even calling Fox to have the pollster(s) fried. More than pathetic.
[comment]trump is an idiot!
[comment]Trump demands Fox lie about his popularity to appease his fragile ego. That‚Äôs the headline.
[comment]Because facts and data are biased against him.
[comment]Is it in Fox News‚Äô best interest to have polls showing republicans losing[comment]I would be careful about relying on polls. Most polls showed Hillary winning in 2016 and look what happened there.

I think it‚Äôs great that we‚Äôre ahead[comment]Put Kellyanne Conjob on the polls again Orange guy...she lies almost as much as Trump
[comment]Hey drumpf we all know how you love to win awards even giving yourself an award that you didn't win[comment]Meh. Trump has been ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù in nearly every single poll in 2016. Yet[comment]He‚Äôs so pathetic lol
[comment]I dont like trump at all[comment]This one-term loser is going down hard.
[comment]Wow does fox not want viewers bec I doubt they love the polls either
[comment]I hope it's good for us if even Fox News has him losing.
[comment]What was the response of Fox News and of the pollster?
[comment]It‚Äôs not quite State Run Media... yet.
[comment]Facts and numbers are stubborn things. Viruses are even more stubborn
[comment]What a loser! Is he going to fire everyone who is against him? Like almost the whole America?
[comment]Ffs  lmao
[comment]I'll quote Lizzo...Truth hurts.
[comment]Narcissism. Just the most blatant case of all time. Instead of trying to understand the cause of any issue he always shoots the messenger.
[comment]If anything
He's stupid like a fox.
[comment]This dude is a child. What an absolute embarrassment to this country
[comment]Lol that pic in the thumbnail is particularly bad
[comment]i mean[comment]I'm concerned about the accuracy of all the polls that show each Democrat leading for the general election.  Right now each Democratic candidate is spending their money just to win the primary. The RNC has tons of money that they get to keep dry to use for the general election. It makes sense that the Democratic candidates would be ahead now since they are in effect campaigning. But when only one is designated as the nominee then they are going to get the full brunt of all that RNC cash being spent in the general campaign. That and the fact that in any election the incumbent is going to have an advantage has me very concerned.
[comment]Let‚Äôs just fire his nasty dumb ass instead!!!!!
[comment]Yeah we all know how good polls are with trump
[comment]I love the thumbnail photo[comment]Maybe these Fox polls are a tool to scare them to make sure the trumpers go out and vote. Considering the expected democratic voter this election. Just a thought.
[comment]Fox news is not doing enough to protect Trumps fragile ego.
[comment]This made us laugh hysterically.

You can't make this garbage up.

Just.....wow....Fuck this guy.
[comment]Hard to fire away the truth trumbo[comment]Fox News praises him at every turn and he just casually calls them corrupts.
His allies are crumbling just like his little facade
[comment]Of course Fox has the worst polls

[comment]but wasn‚Äôt he doing badly in the polls when he took the whitehouse in 2016?  i mean[comment]He looks like my mother in law in that picture.
[comment]He will find a way to cheat to win this election or dispute the results and the Republican Party will just sit there and do nothing.
[comment]He's such a giant baby.   Look at him.  LOOK at him. 

How do his supporters not see this?    I will never forgive them for this shit.
[comment]He can be behind in the polls and still win the electoral college[comment]Don‚Äôt worry.  Bernie will lose the nomination and his base will vote for Snoopy or something[comment]Nice

It‚Äôs crazy how much paper waste there is from snail mail as well. 

Sincere question - what is the modern case for keeping USPS?  What people or use cases is it serving that digital and FedEx can‚Äôt do equally well?
[comment]You forgot a zero in there popeye. Each person would need to donate ~110...not 11.
[comment]Send your parents or grandparents a card or letter in the mail! They would love that and you‚Äôd be able to use those stamps!!
[comment]Done! (I needed them anyway)
[comment]I‚Äôll buy a book tomorrow.
[comment]I bought two[comment]Ordering now. USPS is awesome[comment]How about charging for stamps to use every time you send and email?  Yeahhhhhj!!

[comment]Ooh[comment]grand idea[comment]Hey people! Are you tired of starving with the given corona lockdown?

So are we!

Luckily for us! We've come up with the perfect solution!

That's why weve started guilting redditors into buying stamps.

Abolishing the EC requires such a high bar it's not even on the cards even if Dems win the senate.

https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/heed-jimmy-carter-on-the-danger-of-mail-in-voting-11586557667
[comment]I know several people that had mail-in ballots thrown out by a republican AG because their signatures didn‚Äôt match. The only ballots thrown out in Missouri were in major metro areas[comment]Funny how this idea wasn't pushed during the last few primaries. Now that it helps the Dem agenda they're game to vote by mail[comment]Prior to the pandemic
However
So
&amp;#x200B;

1. If a voter doesn't get a ballot within a certain time frame2. Each ballot would come with a unique "tracking number" on the inside3. Limited polling stations should remain open (with appropriate social distancing) for people who's ballots by mail all seem to be lost in transit4. We may want to consider a sunset provision so that this applies to this year's elections and maybe the 2022 elections
&amp;#x200B;

One issue that is probably going to arise is that it may be up to the states to determine  whether voting by mail is allowed.  If that happens
If the federal government is not allowed to directly mandate that vote by mail be allowed
There is also a vague possibility we could tie other federal funding to the states to passing these types of voter laws.  For example[comment]I'll bet the percentage of people who support abolishing the Postal Service without a fight is single digits.

This 2019 poll showed 74% loved the Post Office
&amp;#x200B;

[comment]Why didn't we do this before Bernie dropped out so we didn't have to send Wisconsin out into the pandemic?
[comment]It‚Äôs irrational to oppose this as a Republican too. Studies from the slow implementation of vote by mail in Washington showed a relatively small increase in total voter percentage (2-4%) in the places it was implemented in. Some of the marginal increases came from rural counties which had difficult time voting due to lack of access and some of the increases came from younger voters. Also[comment]Personally[comment]The number is eerily similar to trumbo disproval number of 70%[comment]Why can‚Äôt they make a govt website where you can put in your social security number and info  to register and vote online??
[comment]Yeah and a similar percentage want legal weed. 

I‚Äôm waiting still waiting for both issues to get fixed[comment]Ignorant here.  So how would that work?  I get mailed a ballot to my address from the DMV?  How does anyone know I was the one that actually filled it out?  I've never voted absentee so I don't know how it works.
[comment]The Russians are licking their stamps as we speak.
[comment]It's probably just the 70% of voters who will vote for Biden[comment]...and there will be virtually NO FRAUD either.
[comment]This is going to lessen for a while[comment]It's always about 30% of the population on the wrong side of any issue.

[comment]I now HATE republicans.  I knew they were bugs[comment]Rep Adam Schiff:

&gt; "The withholding of military assistance to get these investigations
Murder.
[comment]I'm so heartened by how many people behind the scenes after so smart and ready to defend democracy
[comment]That speech also came right after a Devin Nunes pile of word-vomit that had me so pissed off. No wonder he had a little fire in him too when he gave this little closing speech. It was spot on and much needed after so much Republican lying and just...bullshitting.
[comment]My concern is that this is going to be Clinton Impeachment 2.0
&gt;The bad news for Republicans is that impeachment
As long as they hold their line in the Senate
Nunes and the other Republicans aren't taking this seriously. Every time Nunes opens his mouth he talks about how the TV ratings are bad. He doesn't give a care at all with respect to what is at risk and what this does to weaken the balance of power in our Government.
[comment]An American hero.
[comment]Schiff is a very bad liar.
[comment]I dont know how Schiff manages to keep a straight face when Nunes goes off on his word salad bullshit rants. I'd be tearing my hair out sitting directly next to him.

[comment]This is bullshit.  We have been seeing this for 1

Dumb liberals. Trump is going to win because you‚Äôre party
Don‚Äôt get me started with cranky old pelosi. I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs in cahoots with trump because by god her behavior is something else. Your party is in absolute disarray and I‚Äôm saddened to see such delusional optimism. Just as this whole impeachment trick. Thanks for wasting our tax dollars for nothing you stupid blue fucks. Only DUMB voters who don‚Äôt understand the political system took that news seriously. Good god
TELL me[comment]I am sick of people saying "history will judge." History is written by the victors and I don't seen any indication the Republicans plan on giving up power. The media is complicit as they ignore the threat and promote the idea that this is just another election; vote your pocketbook.

Russia is at war with the United States. Vote your country.
[comment]Or they just won‚Äôt go to jail. Because. You know. It‚Äôs rich assholes in the government and Rich assholes In the government never go to jail.
[comment]Oh yeah he'd start a war for sure to keep his election going.
[comment]Yeah[comment]But there was no crime or even something trump did or said that was wrong or bad. This was a with hunt from the Democrats to try and get trump out of office since they cannot beat him any other way. It's sad to see the democratic party stoop so low.

Get your butts ready for a wild election year.

It's just sad how many people still buy into this narrative[comment]Did anyone think anyone wouldnt  hold onto poqer no matter what?
[comment]I‚Äôm finding myself wondering if we‚Äôre headed for a military coup. And in which direction.
[comment]Trump would not be the first. Ceaser crossed the Rubicon with his army for this exact reason.

[comment]To be fair[comment]it's safe to say that 53% of Republicans are flaming anti-American racists
[comment]Wtf?
[comment]Of course they do I mean Lincoln got rid of their slaves
[comment]Republicans are delusional.
[comment]Believe it or not[comment]Yeah that would be the 53% who think Lincoln did a bad job because they‚Äôre racist
[comment]and the other 47% think he's better than Jesus. The cult of Trump commands that level of stupidity.
[comment]Conservatives hate Lincoln.  This is no surprise.  T_D regularly shits on him for being a "tyrant" and "literally the worst president of all time."
[comment]Ironic that 53% of Republicans thinking Trump is a better president than Lincoln is the most compelling argument for States Rights I've ever seen[comment]Because it's a cult
[comment]Racism.
[comment]I caught about 10 minutes of Fox "News" at a relative's house over the holiday.

It was all about Trump's triumphant visit to Afghanistan
It'll happen any day now
And still
So basically
This is the "manufactured reality" that a third of the country is being force-fed daily
Sigh.

Fortunately[comment]You remember how the GOP treated Lincoln[comment]But every dictator has a core of dimwits that follow them.  We saw Kanye's visit to the Oval Office
He represented less well the billionaire base who regard Trump as their rather dumb guard dog[comment]Yes it‚Äôs a shitty cult almost as shitty as the sample size of this crappy poll....IJS
[comment]Of course they do - shocking part is that it‚Äôs only 53% and not 90%
[comment]Jesus Christ[comment]A significant number if them are trolling. They're doing it to own the libs and sabotage the hated liberal media.

And then another significant portion are in the Cult of Trump and likely have hard feelings about the War of Northern Aggression.
[comment]Fucking how?
[comment]Given the current population of Republicans[comment]I hope the South really does rise again and this time we just let those dumb assholes leave.
[comment]Helps to note that even though Republicans have traditionally loved calling themselves "The Party of Lincoln"[comment]Probably more than 53%.  Source: am Republican and agree.
[comment]"Think" might be too strong a description as to what is going on in their heads[comment]The traditional Republican of the 1960s was actually more educated and darker than today.  They were country club whites and an emerging black middle class and northern.  Eisenhower got in the low-40% of black votes.  Nixon got 37% of the black vote.  Then Goldwater started saying Lincoln wouldn't like his current party's stance on civil rights in 1964.  He slipped the party's standing with important coalitions

Then 1968 Nixon and the Southern Strategy and the Republicans have been playing the same song since: hate sells to the stupid and we can keep the rich in by bribing them with their own money.  African Americans?  They didn't need them with the former Southern Democrats becoming Republicans by the day.

Today
Vote against any and all Republicans you can in 2020.  They can't be trusted as dogcatcher and definitely not trusted to govern responsibly.
[comment]This is your brain off facts
[comment]I love the ‚ÄúSee
Even though we know the parties pretty much traded places since then.

[comment]Good job jarheads!!!!
[comment]The heritage argument is absolute garbage. I've heard people say
Some want to say the Civil War wasn't about slavery
Look
I think the naming of some places using Confederate figures like generals should be reviewed and changed. This isn't about erasing history. It's about preserving it the right way so that we can be educated about it without celebrating it.
[comment]They should kick out anyone they see posting them. There is no place in the military for separatist or fascist ideology. If we can keep people out for bone spurs[comment]Makes utter sense.  The union defeated the confederation. It should be looked upon as at least socially treasonous imo. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[comment]Americans aren't comprehending what's going on. Young racists who want to join the militias are encouraged to get basic training in the military and then they are more useful. And they can even proudly proclaim themselves veterans even though they lied when they swore the oath to protect the Constitution from all enemies
God help us if these people ever get control of the Air Force. Oh wait...
[comment]Wait what? How were these flags even allowed to fly on US military bases? They were an enemy flag?
[comment]I have two great sources for people who say the Civil War was about anything other than slavery.

1. Here are reasons for seceding in their own words [https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states)
2. Here is the famous "Cornerstone Address" given by the Vice President of the Confederacy [https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/](https://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/)

[comment]How was this not already the policy???? Good lord.
[comment]I really hate how these hick fucks use the "battle" flag as their "Confederate flag". They should use the real one that is 75% plain white to show how they really feel about people of color[comment]*brushes hands off*
Racism has finally been defeated today. We can all go home now.
[comment]The real news is what took them so long?
[comment]When the General says so[comment]It's not the flag/country they've pledged an oath to uphold.

Matter of fact[comment]It's the equivalent of someone flying an ISIS flag; it's the flag of an enemy that sought to destroy this country. An enemy that was defeated.
[comment]The thing I love is that flag isn't *the* confederate flag.  It only appeared in the \~50s and was a response to the civil rights moment.  If you really cared about your history you would fly your family's flag!
[comment]Good for the Marines and hopefully if it's not already will be removed from all other military bases and then maybe somebody can tell that fucking orange orangutan we have in office in Washington to quit kissing the asses of white trash supremacist and nationalist and thinking these people are fucking heroes or whatever else he praises them for they're nothing but trash!! But then again 40% like this guy because when in a cult you have to agree and do as the dear leader says or you will be out of the cult.
[comment]Is anyone brave enough to see how r/conservative is handling this?
[comment]Worth noting[comment]I might have an unpopular opinion in this case
To be fair though[comment]Its surprising to hear they were even allowed in the first place. Flying the flag of a defeated enemy army on your military base? Odd

Trump voters and non voters tend to be selfish and emotion based. They aren't going to drop Trump/vote Biden based on comprehensive arguments that it'll be in the best interests of all.


But if they're worried about their lives and their jobs they might be won over.

Poke holes into the delusion of adequacy he is trying to spread.

Of course that‚Äôs how you adjudicate if trump abused his office to pressure a foreign government for help with the election.
[comment]I'm not the biggest fan of Pelosi (although I'll choose her any day over Trump) but I have to give her credit where credit is due.  Trump always liked to portray himself as this sharp shrewd strategist (or "stable genius")
Her intentional slow-walking and resistance to rush any of this is beginning to pay dividends while Trump and his team scramble to rearrange the deckchairs on the Titanic.

The only way out of this is to tell everyone nation wide
This is a mess...
[comment]Is majority 50.9%
Or
75%?

It makes a difference
[comment]Fuck all these polls. The only thing they ever show me is that a large portion of us are complete morons.
[comment]To the poster mnd you're absolutely right his base doesn't believe in vaccines and that's because they don't believe in science[comment]Doesnt matter. Joes front runner now.  Its time to give up.  Im selling my home and moving to BC.  Trumps in another 4
[comment]Good.
[comment]Majority of americans. Where do they pull these polls from? Oh wait I forgot out if their fucking asses.
[comment]41% think they‚Äôre doing a-ok. Wtf?
[comment]The displaced the_donald zombies are out in force on here and the rest of reddit.
[comment]So where have the majority come from? Is this a made up percentage or have the majority of Americans voted this?

You tanks just seek to hate on something just because you can. Quite pathetic tbh.
[comment]What took you all so long to figure out trumbo was a moron ?... Lol
[comment]Hillary is going to win in a landslide.
[comment]Now?
[comment]The poll might be giving false hope to some people. From http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/04/08/rel4a.-.coronavirus.pdf :

&gt;A total of 1phones. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Among the entire sampleas Democrats**members of another party.

&gt; The landline total respondents were 350
and there were 652 cell phone respondents.
[comment]Too bad the majority of Americans aren't represented by any office.  What matters in the US:  
1.  Majority of Congressional districts  
2.  Majority of States  
3.  Majority of the EC  
4.  Majority of the SCOUS

[comment]Is it really so much to ask for a fair trial? Only with Mitch and the GOP can that be seen as a partisan issue...
[comment]Maybe Ms. Pelosi should ask the French Govt. to loan her the Guillotine. Maybe the sight of a very lethal machine will force Trump to resign and move back to Trump Tower for good.
[comment]I do t always see eye to eye with pelosi butt his is a boss move on her part
[comment]I love this for no other reason than it leaves Trump twisting in the wind even longer. I imagine him sitting there on his bed in the White House residence[comment]You‚Äôve got Mitch by the short hairs Madam Speaker. No need to proceed until the Senate has defined and committed to actual trial procedures.

Let them stew for a while[comment]What would be Moscow Mitch's strategy
Does this put any real pressure on Moscow Mitch to do anything?

Can Moscow Mitch use that to his advantage?
[comment]Like the fair trial in the house?
[comment]I guess I was naive but I held out hope that some Republicans were courageous enough to go against Trump... to go against authoritarianism but it doesn't seem that way.  I finally realized the Republicans are all "Trump" now.  He is their Dear Leader.
[comment]Every step the Republicans have done little more than attempt to demonize the accusers
and complain about the LEGAL format of the inquiry
They had no valid defense
So Trump IS GUILTY of abuse of power.

Trump has ALSO repeatedly stopped members of his cabinet from testifying
Telling his people to literally IGNORE congressional subpoenas.  This IS obstruction of justice
Meanwhile
&amp;#x200B;

SO...

&amp;#x200B;

Speaker Nancy Pelosi is well within her rights to withhold sending the two articles of impeachment to the corrupt Senate at this time.
[comment]Can the Muller report now[comment]I would like to see Pelosi announce that they are going to bend over backwards and give Trump the month of January to allow witnesses. At the same time
Bill Clinton was investigated over a land deal in Arkansas which had nothing to do with his presidency or national security. Trump should be impeached over the Trump Foundation.
[comment]Lol fair trial like this whole impeachment situation was a "fair" trialü§£ü§£ü§£ü§´ü§´ü§´
[comment]So wait[comment]Do you people actually believe that 3/4 of the senate will vote to oust Trump? This will be a repeat of 1998 where the senate acquitted President Clinton.
[comment]A fair Senate trial is one where they wipe their ass with the impeachment articles.

What she wants is an impeachment.

[comment]There's no question about it. Anyone who has seen the numbers knows that coronavirus deaths are grossly under counted. The only real question is what is the exact amount? Is it 15% or 50%?

Very bizarre and pathetic.

[comment]Trump is truly an inferior being to be called a person

They have been yammering away like this and conning the chumps with this shit for so many decades now it all seems normal and acceptable to a goodly percent of Americans. President Trump talks just like Mark Levin. Politics for angry 12 year olds.

Hate clearly has a permanent home here.

[comment]Ya think?
[comment]You don't have to be a language expert to have the ability to see that Trump is an inferior person.  You just have to be better than inferior yourself.
[comment]You small and silly people need to begin keeping your eye on the real ball.
[comment]I do kinda wish he'd stop using the same adjectives. He uses them over and over it's very very bad speech. Repetitive speech is sloppy and he could pick up a thesaurus and expand his vocabulary a little bit.

Debbie wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton got what they deserved. Bernie should have been the candidate. He had momentum and the support of millennials.

It‚Äôs going to be the same with Hillary‚Äôs emails.

This happens time and again and the Left still has no answer to wild and crazy accusations from the GOP which end up getting a life of their own that won't die.

How many times will the Dems allow themselves to be character assassinated before they actually do something about it?

This happened with Hillary[comment]Nobody learned anything? It worked exactly as planned. They learned it works.
[comment]It wasn't a screw-up.  They were helping Trump to make it a tighter race when his polls were in the dumps.

It's what they always do[comment]More than anything else the media gave Trump free press and anti-Hillary conspiracy theories free press.

[comment]Above the law? No. Two different sets of consequences dependent upon class? Yes.
[comment]Hillary saying no one is above the law. That's just beautiful.
[comment]He choose to resign.   Also that was when there was an actual republican party ...not just an offshoot of the president. 

Also Clinton and co committed multiple crimes but never was criminally punished and neither was Nixon so fuck these criminals who never paid fines or faced time when if any one of us did half of what rhey dis we'd be serving life or financially ruined.

It is there corruption which paved the way for people like trump.  It was America's disillusionment and dissatisfaction with politicians like Nixon and Clinton that allowed self proclaimed swamp drainer trump to rise to power.  Clinton is a disgrace.  Nixon was a disgrace.  Obama is the only half decent president I've ever seen and even he has a lot to answer for.  Until out leaders start actually represent the majority over the 0.1% nothing will change.

However[comment]House needs to investigate.
[comment]There were also plenty of reports of polling stations where they had separate machines for Democrat and Republicans and often fewer for Democrats and even though there were virtually no Republican primary voters Dems were not allowed to use those machines "because they are reserved".  Even airlines get that when the coach lines are long and no biz or first class passengers are around they can help everyone.
[comment]Good news is that more democrats cast ballots in 2020 than 2016 by a lot (1.94M vs 1.4M).  So part of the line problem was higher turnout.  Bring it Texas. And it happened in the primary so hopefully more voters are aware and vote early.

Anyone who says they‚Äôre sitting it out or voting third party gets scolded on this website. But on lefty Facebook it‚Äôs the complete opposite case. I‚Äôve currently got at least a few dozen people screeching at me over a comment I made where I said despite volunteering/voting for Bernie in the primary I‚Äôll be voting for Biden in November.

Another comment hit it on the head though. The Trump admin has already gotten several SC picks. With another term he will likely get another two. RBGs health is very questionable. I doubt she makes it on the court another 4.5 years. 

What are the chances the convention pushes a new candidates like Cuomo? I just wish there were someone else...

This is just one example of a foreign troll operating there
[comment]So I'm willing to take the heat - it's fine - but this argument is unfair.

Many liberal voters vote for *moral* reasons. If they they see two candidates that they think are immoral it's unfair to chastise them for not voting for either even if one is arguably "the lesser of two evils" - evil is still evil. Now
Now[comment]I feel like this[comment]The old geriatric Democrats who have retained their leadership positions are always blaming everybody else when they don't get the needed votes to win. This blame shifting has got to stop. Biden's campaign has failed to sincerely reach across the table and offer the ever-growing progressives wing of Democrats any meaningful reason to support a Republican-lite platform.

What does Biden and the 1990s Blue Dog Democrats expect? Adoration and enthusiasm while doing nothing for your constituents?

Biden is responsible for attracting voters to his cause. Biden needs to do a reality check on his campaign. Hillary certainly did not comprehend the dire situation her campaign for President was in. Biden better comprehend what it takes for voters to embrace Biden's candicency for President.

It is NOT good enough to simply demand progressives vote for Biden. Progressives are worried about real issues like the 10 year time frame before irreversible and dire climate events. Insulting progressives for pie in the sky demands on Climate change is a sure way of losing votes. Demanding that progressives vote for Biden while openly flouting future climate change disaster is beyond irrational[comment]It‚Äôs true. I do completely understand the hesitation[comment]I agree with this post.  Trump is the "Danger of our Times" and must be voted out.  When Biden gets in we can hold his feet to the fire with things we don't agree with.  But the Supreme Court pick (or at least stopping Mcconnell from approving another arch-conservative one and more other judges) and every Cabinet position i.e. the entire Federal Administration will be light-years better.

[title]Trump‚Äôs Plan For Coronavirus Second Wave Shows He‚Äôs Learned Absolutely Nothing
[selftext]https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/donald-trumps-plan-for-coronavirus-second-wave-shows-hes-learned-absolutely-nothing[comment]He only cares about votes. Everything he does centers around getting votes. Nothing else matters.
[comment]What does learning have to do with Trump‚Äôs attempts to win the 2020 election?

Why do so many of us liberals make the mistake of thinking Republicans are stupid or just don‚Äôt get it.

They get it.

They just have different priorities and plans than you.
[comment]What is the "actual" plan for Coronavirus wave two? Shut everything down again just as it is getting back up to speed? That would be a disaster.
[comment]At this point I believe their intent is to let this run free and let the chips fall where they may. Herd immunity....terms that found their use in vetrinary medicine to describe the status of cultivated groups of animals intended for consumption. Ironic.
[comment]Most of the 50 million people that died of the 1918 Spanish Flu died during the second wave.
[comment]But... Susan Collins...
[comment]I can‚Äôt imagine the destruction if he gets another 4 years. We‚Äôre in shambles now...
[comment]Republicans abandoned the concept of governance a couple decades ago because they came to the conclusion there is a risk of more government involved with government.  The priority became maintaining power for profits from there.

Their new motto became: "Government is bad and doesn't work.  Elect me and I'll prove it!"

They'll spend your tax dollars in response to chaos that puts their power in peril.  That spending will go to the private sector
New Federalism needs to be dead and buried with the election and year of 2020.
[comment]Has anyone considered that even if the economy comes back close to normal

[comment]Learning requires acknowledging you didn‚Äôt already know[comment]Trump learning something about anything would be a precedent by itself.
[comment]Of course he hasn‚Äôt. Trump doesn‚Äôt learn. 

The problem here isn‚Äôt that he‚Äôs not preparing for wave 2. It‚Äôs that he doesn‚Äôt seem to want to prepare for any scenario. There are several scenarios possible including ongoing slow burn and intermittent waves and he‚Äôs not ready for any of them. 

Every scenario ends with him unprepared. It‚Äôs bad.

He needs something new everyday. That's what he's trying to create a fake Obama administration scandal. If the news is focused on that[comment]Thanks Trump!
[comment]Every Democrat needs to talk about this constantly. And the gdp numbers too. 

Obviously could too[comment]Most media is missing a lot. For the past month or more
Meanwhile
Did any of you see any broadcast news channel cover it? I didn't.

The newsmedia have consistently focused on all the wrong things for several years now
What's truly frightening though
Too far? You think so? Look back over the past year at everything that's happened
The only way we can be ready for what Trump and the GOP *will* do before November to keep Trump in office[comment]You think maybe there's a difference since the current unemployment is by design and the great depression was a failure of the system?
[comment]There's four times more liquidity in the stock market and as long as rich people aren't going poor[comment]Thank God we don't have debt that will cripple a generation of fiscally responsible elected leaders.  /s
[comment]Because Republicans are never held responsible for the consequences of their economic policies.
[comment]A global health pandemic makes us stay home and raises unemployment rates. Was that so unusual that jobless rates would reach historic levels? Maybe the media had common sense enough to know this was going to happen and didn‚Äôt need to state the obvious?
[comment]Anything that comes out of the dear leaders mouth you can't believe but things coming out of the government pertaining to jobs or the virus you have to think of it  being 30 to 50% worse[comment]It's possible that the media was going with the lower (but still the worst since the Great Depression) unemployment rate because the higher rate would be based on a decision
The change in methodology
I think it is enough to measure things the "old" way and announce an employment rate of 14.7% instead of doing it the 2020 way and announcing a measurement of 19.7%.

The last President to preside over a dip in the unemployment rate to 14.7% was Hebert Hoover (A Republican)
Some might say that it's unfair to blame a President for the economic consequences of an epidemic that is unprecedented in US history
So
Anyhow
Maybe we should begin to raise the trademark challenger question of "Are you better off today than you were four years ago?".  If people ask themselves that when they vote
We can't quite run on the old Bill Clinton "It's the economic
Elizabeth Warren as VP would help a lot with Biden's ability to do economic based planning and messaging that appeals to his base.  They could almost run a dual campaign where Biden runs as statesperson who embraces expertise
I also think[comment]Shhh[comment]but lets keep the country closed right guys?
[comment]Don't worry - the Eternal Regime will just redefine employment as being white.

Right now it‚Äôs just important to elect someone who will respect the law and the constitution.
[comment]If I had to guess the ones who don‚Äôt vote are the most opinionated about the way things should be .
[comment]Voter apathy campaigns are real and they work.
[comment]Most Americans are super uninformed and dont bother making any attempt at educating themselves
[comment]Well[comment]They just don't care. All these diatribes about work and disaffection are BS. They aren't entertained or or interested so they don't bother trying to figure out who they want to vote for. Their friends and family don't vote[comment]Bernie Bros seem to think they can motivate the stay at home voters - I bloody well hope so because we need a crushing defeat so the resident parasite cannot claim it was rigged and refuse to leave.
[comment]First a lot of them arent able to vote.

Second what exactly is going to convince them to do it? The popular vote doesnt matter at all anyway and each district is basically already decided before any voting even starts.

I always vote but I can understand how people feel like it just doesnt matter.
[comment]This year this could possibly happen:

If you‚Äôre republican and don‚Äôt like trump u don‚Äôt have any other choices = probably won‚Äôt  vote

If your a democrat your candidate can be on one extreme end of the party or the other.   So if Bernie wins most of the Bloomberg supporters won‚Äôt vote and vice versa
[comment]Maybe they don‚Äôt vote because the electoral college deters them from doing so?

I fail to see how voting is effective[comment]Lots of people are very self-centered and think of something doesn't impact them[comment]I want to caution everyone in these comments from generalizing that people don't vote because they are lazy
While this can certainly be said for some people
Of course we need a more engaged electorate. We need schools to register young people to vote and educate them on how they can do this in college. We should absolutely not stop trying to engage the unengaged. But to perpetuate a narrative that these are the only reasons why people don't vote is irresponsible and let's the government get away with what they are doing.
[comment]Friendly reminder that there is active voter disenfranchisement in this country that *prevents* citizens from voting as well.
[comment]I hope most blacks and Hispanics will not vote in November and that white conservatives will come out in force to re-elect Donald Trump.
[comment]How could you not vote for Sanders or against trump???  To not vote should be in some way illegal.  If you don't want to vote you should vote to not vote but still show your enguagment.

I hate Dump and his shit show
Almost everything he proposes is a taxpayer's handout to the lower and middle classes.

Personally[comment]This assumption just continues to push down the road the inevitable riots that will be necessary to get our democracy back.  Does that sound overly dramatic?  Alarmist?  

Good.  Because everyone sitting back being depressed or mildly angry about the impeachment trial
He's being acquitted on the argument that anything a president does to get re-elected *is* in the public interest and legal.  That's the closing argument his lawyer made.  

That means having Barr open investigations into the top dem candidates is fine.  It means fining or starting investigations into news channels or reporters is fine.  It means suspending November's election because they found widespread "election tampering" is fine.  All of them are fine and legal if it helps him get re-elected.  Who's going to stop any of it?  Trump's Justice Dept?  Washington Republicans?  Maybe the Supreme Court?  The one headed by the Chief Justice that just silently presided over the sham trial?

He won't run because he knows he's damaged goods at this point and won't be able to get elected to the office of dog catcher in Texas.

[comment]Good on him for doing what's best for the country even after his personal ambitions didn't pan out. I hope all of the remaining candidates follow his example.
[comment]I would have happily voted Beto O'Rourke .I  was saddened to see him leave. What I admire is his ability to see how he can help keep our democracy.His passion for this republic. His dropping out is not a failure. He is a shining light[comment]I hope we see Texas turn blue sooner rather than later.
[comment]give me hope pls
[comment]We need him as a Senator more than we need him as a President.

He needs to run again.  He can do this!!!
[comment]No.
[comment]Why is he not running? He is the only Democrat with a shot and he won't do it.
[comment]I love this. Someone with conviction that was obviously running for president for the right reasons and is now continuing that fight for the right reasons. Just a good dude who cares. Texas is lucky to have him.

Our political structure with it's checks and balances was well thought by the founding fathers but it did not take into account the two party system that came shortly after the ratification of the constitution.
[comment]W and Trump have greatly empowered the GOP. The 2003 Iraq invasion and Trump's environmental regulation rollbacks will keep M-IC and fossil fuel dollars rolling into the GOP for years to come.

Unless the Dems do something about campaign contribution limits.

[comment]shocking.  

I wonder how many more people could have had health care for the cost of this study.
[comment]..... and this headline shows why Medicare For All is the best route forward.

Because going from ‚Äúhealth insurance‚Äù to ‚Äúhealth care‚Äù will reduce the number of deaths even further.

Senator Warren means well with her plan[comment]You mean we're pro-life after all? Who'd have thought!
[comment]OBAMACARE IS TRASH AND A LIE A MANIPULATED TO MAKE YOU THINK ITS GOOD[comment]The logical fallacy here is the unproven assumption that Obamacare would somehow magically result in more people having health insurance that would magically be of the same quality than the health care that extended people's lives in this study.

[comment]Healthcare[comment]Having health insurance reduces death rate?

Yeah
Next you'll be telling me that water is wet.
[comment]And water is wet :/
[comment]No shit ? Lol
[comment]What is wrong with this country that this needs to be "proved".
[comment]I wonder if the study is at all adjusted for the people that ended up with outrageous deductibles after Obamacare.

My Dad died 100% because we had to get rid of our previously great healthcare once the ACA passed. We were lower middle class and therefore went from havimg negligible deductibles to having a 5000$ one. He needed to stay in the hospital for observation but decided he couldnt afford the deductible. Went home and died. A complication between his insulin and the powerful antibiotics he was on. 

The ACA insured the abject poor at the coat of the lower middle class. Not sure if the end result is a net positive.
[comment]"Obamacare study proves that robbing someone gives you more money"
[comment]Say what you will about Clinton
Universal healthcare became *her* project [comment]Impossible! Next you‚Äôll be telling me that seatbelts reduce the number deaths in car accidents!

Maybe they can discuss a minority day for witnesses after the trial is done? That would only be fair. 

The minority shouldn‚Äôt expect to have it go their way because they are the minority and that‚Äôs how it goes. They need to have a convincing enough case to get support for their theories. Living in an echo chamber makes it difficult when you try to reach other people.

[comment]And we don't know everything about what he's been doing. We probably don't have anywhere near half the story yet.

Only criminal I can think of who is compatible would be Trump's idol Vladimir Putin. It's probably true that he's the richest man in the world.

Way I see it this was the reason why Trump wanted to be in politics in the first place. He's known for years about Vladimir's fabulous hidden wealth. He's been laundering his dirty money for decades. He wanted to do the same thing Vladimir did but BIGGER. 

If Vladimir made an enormous amount of money in Russia

[selftext]https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/stephen-miller-white-supremacy-republican-party[comment]Some are just better at hiding it than others but it's prevalent.
[comment]98% of people at that level of politics are differing degrees of evil.  On both sides of the isle.
[comment]IMHO
Which leads to "good people on both sides"  thinking.
[comment]I don't hear anyone significant on the Republican side asking him to resign. That speaks VOLUMES.
[comment]Dudes! White supremacy is why all the people who are in the Republican Party moved to the Republican party. After the Civil Rights Act was passed by Democrats ALL the racists moved to the Republican party[comment]It is precisely why 80-90% of Republicans voted for and still support Trump. This WWC economic angst is a euphemism for racism. Racists by any other name are still racists! And this truth makes you uncomfortable to fucking bad! I will scream it to my brain. But[comment]by now with everything that Trump has done or said if they are still Trumpers they are racist.  even if they claim not to be " my grandchildren are biracial " or the now famous "I have black friends " that is just something that helps them deny their true racist beliefs. and this extends to his administration and the GOP.
[comment]This started in the Nixon years... the ["southern strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy). It has only gotten worse. For Republicans to deny the inherent racism in their entire world-view is simply ridiculous.
[comment]And in other news[comment]Trump is the blowback we got for electing Barack Obama
We should have been educated about it and been ready to fight back and instead we still aren't talking about it.
[comment]Miller plays to an audience of one: Donald Trump.   He's the prisoner in a concentration camp who lickspittles to the guards to avoid his own death.

I've been saying that one of the Democratic candidates without a chance should just start spouting Trump like rhetoric and behaving like him. If Republicans decry that behavior it might prompt them to examine their own cuckoo in the Whitehouse.

[title]Obama team fully vetted Biden in 2008 and found no hint of former aide's allegation
[selftext]https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/opinions/biden-tara-reade-allegations-2008-vetting-axelrod/[comment]That's because it didn't exist until Putin paid this woman considerable money to make it up and BernieBros distributed it like useful idiots.

This is not a #MeToo case.  This is another act of war by Vladimir Putin.
[comment]I've been wondering this for a while[comment]The whole think is so fake.  A serial liar makes an accusation almost the moment Biden becomes the Democrat's candidate?  And after a couple of decades?  

[https://medium.com/@eddiekrassenstein/evidence-casts-doubt-on-tara-reades-sexual-assault-allegations-of-joe-biden-e4cb3ee38460](https://medium.com/@eddiekrassenstein/evidence-casts-doubt-on-tara-reades-sexual-assault-allegations-of-joe-biden-e4cb3ee38460)
[comment]I want Biden to win but I also want these allegations to be looked into. I'm not so much concerned of whether the result but that with the whole MeToo movement and Republicans being the party who nominated and stood by a sexual predator like Trump
Her story seems more and more implausible[comment]Trump bragged on TV about doing the same thing Joe is alleged to have done. Puhleese..
[comment]That's odd; [here's an article about Joe Biden from 2008:](https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/04/28/biden-the-lout/)

&gt; Vanity is the most conspicuous characteristic of US Senators en bloc
Maybe vetting wasn't done the way it is now back when sexual assault was ignored more frequently.
[comment]This is the reason why I have a hard time believing this allegation. I am also happy the news isn't dwelling on this either for this reason[comment]2008

If the Democratic Party nullifies the votes of African-Americans to placate the white socialists who couldn't be bothered to go to the polls
Which begs the question: why wasn't this allegation made before the campaign started? She did an interview in 2019 and she had the opportunity to tell her story then. She's wasn't making this claim then. Why not?
[comment]Her story would be a lot more believable if she didn‚Äôt change it all the time. Unfortunately[comment]I‚Äôm ashamed of my party. When did y‚Äôall stop trying to be better?
[comment]That's not actually enough.

Sadly trump.team said the same about all those fucking scum bag criminals who are now gone or behind bars.

Joe needs to clear his name.  8 women is 8 too many.  Joe needs to get this done and dusted so he can lead.  

We cannot have this hanging over him for 4 years and give the gop fuel for fires every fox newsbite.

If there's no evidence and no proof the claims they need to be heard by the authorities  and countered by biden and his team.  They managed it for a supreme court judge and that worked out ok (he was cleared) so they can do the same for Joe and move forward to lead.
[comment]This is how hard the Republicans tried to pin something bad on the Obamas and the Obama Administration.

##The Faux News golden oldies##

The birth certificate crisis
The Reverend Wright crisis
The Obama is a Muslim crisis

The Obama is the Antichrist crisis.

The Obama hates Jews because he took a picture with a pirate crisis. 

The lapel pin crisis
The teleprompter crisis
The Dijon mustard crisis
The Obama spends too much time golfing crisis

The sneeze guard crisis
The sleeveless Michelle Obama crisis
The tan suit crisis
The tire gauge crisis.

The Arugula Moment
The lobster dinner crisis
The "Ape in heels" moment
The "Ape in college" moment for Malia.

And the time an 11 year old Malia wore a shirt with peace sign on it and got called a wh*re.

The terrorist fist bump crisis. 

The
The saluting with a coffee cup crisis
The putting his feet on the desk crisis.

The cost of vacationing in Hawaii crisis.

The Jade Helm military invasion of Texas.

The Obama wants to talk with our enemies without preconditions
The bike helmet crisis
The "Hip Hop BBQ birthday celebration that didn't create any jobs". crisis.

And then there they were the insults to his family and his presidency.

The Michelle is transgender and actually named Michael
Joe Wilson yelling "You lie"
The theft of a supreme court nomination
The multiple do nothing congresses that refused to give Obama anything to sign for fear he would have some kind of legacy when he left office.

And finally
##---------------------------------------------------------------------------##

[comment]It‚Äôs very popular with me[comment]Women and POC understand that way more is at stake for them.....
[comment]Maybe because women personally feel like he should be impeached because most women voted Hillary. It‚Äôs not surprising at all more women would be anti-Trump since the 2016 gender divide in the vote was the biggest in history.
[comment]Probably because women are dumb enough to believe hes actually going to get impeached lmao
[comment]Makes sense. More men are Republican. More women are Democrats.
[comment]In other news[comment]I'm a mid 30s white male[comment]Is this not obvious? Most people understand that Pres. Trump is at least somewhat sexist or a womanizer. As not everybody treats both genders equally/fairly[comment]So it‚Äôs true: women are smarter than men

[comment]The problem here is the persisting idea (for some) that the issue is still the truth concerning the Biden's. The idea is that Trump's malfeasance is on the order of an interrogating police officer playing fast and loose with the rules in order to pull out a true confession. I'm not saying this is all a good situation
That's why he was fine with Russia finding dirt on Hillary. Because it just doesn't matter where you get the dirt[comment]Trump is a great example of what happens when a spoiled child grows up. He‚Äôs had a silver spoon in his mouth his whole life and has never been held accountable for anything.

Sadly the Republican Party is putting party before country. Further more than willing to shred the Constitution if it means that they will gain more power.
[comment]Sadly
I urge every Democrat to start mobilizing local action groups with the intent of preparing for demonstrations and civil actions in the street.
[comment]Impeach all of his underlings that are protecting him while every crime he has committed is filed as a separate article of impeachment and sent to the Senate for trial separately.
[comment]This is what a dictator does. He'd be right at home in Venezuela.
[comment]You order a plus size jacket for him and makes sure the arms are tied securely and then put the Cocoa Puffs Prez in the special limousine with two nurses. Make sure the place he goes to for a rest serves McDonalds and has 9 holes.

[comment]IMPEACH!!
[comment]I feel like once Nancy and Adam get the show going they'll have a tidy binder full of impeachable offenses. 

This won't be a hard sell in the House. However the Senate... I don't know. There seems to be a belief that the GOP only has the Trump voters. Or perhaps better said that a majority of GOP voters are Trump supporters. I think itsy safe to say that if they don't run Trump some 
I've heard some rumblings suggesting that if things get much worse then McConnell will ask him to resign. Possible but I sincerely doubt that Trump would resign.  Taking one for the GOP team is no likely to be a concept that Trump would seriously consider.

Also the GOP have shown time and time again that they are very comfortable voting party over country.

So I'm thinking impeachment gets through the house but not the Senate. It should come as no surprise to us which means the proceedings will be interesting but our focus is hitting the pavement for the elections.

[title]Two-thirds of Americans support vote-by-mail[selftext]https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/04/coronavirus-americans-overwhelmingly-support-vote-mail-push/3063765001/[comment]Some Republicans believe it'd lead to wide-spread voter fraud. They should know since they've done it in the person of McCrae Dowless in North Carolina in the 2018 midterm. Dowless got caught. Anyone care to wager whether others have done it but haven't gotten caught yet?

The real reason Republican oppose it is because it'd likely increase minority and maybe also younger voter participation in elections. Republican for some reason figure that voters who aren't old and white would tend to vote for Democrats.
[comment]Because they know it's the end of their careers.
[comment]Republicans are not Americans. They are traitors.
[comment]Ironic that Republicans used to favor vote by mail because it made it easier for people in rural areas to vote.
[comment]It‚Äôs so weird that Republicans are always skeptical about anything democracy‚Äôs propose. Not saying some Democrats aren‚Äôt  skeptical of what Republicans say but it‚Äôs the amount of the republicans that are skeptical about everything[comment]Whaa?? We can't have people *voting!*
[comment]Here's a Republican that endorses mail in voting. Yes
Don't worry[comment]There would be no fraud.  And minorities that come to this country are 50/50 Republican/Democrat.  So I don't understand why Republicans would care.
[comment]We the people... Lol
[comment]So in Australia we had a postal vote to determine if we wanted gay marriage to be legal. It passed pretty comfortably but I know of at least 3 people that just mailed in their adult kids vote for them. I didn't ask which way they voted for their kids but it was definitely wrong to do so.
[comment]Just tell them that blacks and Mexicans hate voting by mail. Done.
[comment]And we know exactly why the GOP doesn‚Äôt want this to happen.
[comment]80% of AZ uses vote by mail
[comment]I really don‚Äôt get how Republicans can say with a straight face that vote-by-mail will lead to massive fraud. Look at states that instituted it-red[comment]Their opinions should be completely ignored now.
[comment]I've seen quite a few conservatives try to bash vote-by-mail by sharing this misleading RCP piece](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/24/28_million_mail-in_ballots_went_missing_in_last_four_elections_143033.html). This ProPublica piece has a good overview of why the claim is misleading: https://www.propublica.org/article/a-conservative-legal-group-significantly-miscalculated-data-in-a-report-on-mail-in-voting
[comment]Republicans oppose vote-by-mail because it side-steps their most powerful methods of voter-suppression:

1. intentionally limiting polling places to predominately right-wing areas
2. Only having the polls open during work days
3. Intentional voter purging
4. Voter intimidation
Vote-by-mail lets voters ignore ALL of that hateful evil...

So Absolutely the Republicans are against vote-by-mail.
[comment]Republicans want Saudi America[comment]Completely unnecessary[comment]I would expect voter fraud this election since the republican voters are a shrinking demographic that's slowly dying off.
Imagine if the democrats flip the senate and the house.
Even if Trump wins[comment]Not surprised at all about the Republicans.

I've always liked going to the polling place.  Going into the booth and getting the sticker adds some fun to it.  But in these uncertain times[comment]Utah has had full mail in voting for years

Trump heard from a GOP strategist that increasing voter turnout is bad for Republicans[comment]it's hard at this point to not got  dark side and feed the hate... republicans don't want expanded absentee voting because they already have the people they want voting by mail; 65 or older[comment]Republicans have always wanted to suppress  voters rights because if they did not they would be the minority party from federal government down to local government.

Just look at how long it was before women had the right to vote when they should have had that right from day one as well as how long others had the right to vote.
[comment]Interesting that you can reach 2/3rds of the population even without the majority of Republicans. It's like they're a minority of the population
[comment]To bad we are no longer a Democracy. Sad.
[comment]Republicans don't oppose vote-by-mail in general. Even Republican states allow people over 65 and the military to vote by mail.

Entirely by coincidence[comment]We have a two party s system. Fair elections give the Democrats an unfair advantage. The Republicans are Constitutional Originalists. They think only white men with property should be allowed to vote.

[comment]In b4 Trumpers are all "YEAH AND THAT'S WHY HE LOST LOLOLOL"
[comment]And I still think that's q reason he lost.

The modern gop needs an insane evangelical pastor/conman. They have to be engaged with wild lies or they get bored.
[comment]McCain was the first candidate to have to defend clickbait bullshit. Trump was the first to embrace it.
[comment]John McCain is proof that the good die young (and I mean that with all possible respect to his age) and pricks live on. That classy man dies and we're stuck with BumbleBee Tuna for President.
[comment]Whenever this is brought up it's worth pointing out fellow Republican Colin Powell found this response from McCain condemnation-worthy and not an example of McCain being a great man.  

&amp;#x200B;

We see it as that because politics is so heinous now and because McCain WAS genuinely trying to diffuse nonsense about Obama rather than be viscious. But his instinctive response to Obama being called an Arab wasn't to challenge that assumption that it's inherently a negative. "He's a Arab." "No
People bending over backwards to praise him for not perpetuating a conspiracy theory was so annoying. The double standard is real.
[comment]To say that McCain defended Obama from the ‚Äúsecret Muslim‚Äù slur is kinda revisionist history. It‚Äôs factual in that he did actually say these words as is shown in the video. However
For reference
So the slur campaign was in full swing throughout much of the Democratic primary season. It‚Äôs at a fever pitch by June. So from June through October McCain lets this racist slur fester because it‚Äôs helping his campaign. He doesn‚Äôt embrace it but does nothing to stamp it out early. This is why it‚Äôs so shocking for the crowd to hear him take a stand. It was the right thing to do but shouldn‚Äôt quite be held up as a very high minded. Some poll somewhere probably showed it could pull in a few moderates while costing him nothing at that point.

[comment]Not sure the urgency isn't a ploy to prevent discovery of how deep the rot goes.

Be patient[comment]I want Trump to be able to brag about having more articles of impeachment against him that any other presidents.
[comment]The problem with calling a Trump impeachment a slam dunk is that no volume of evidence will convince any Republican senator to vote for it. We have entered a time of pure tribal politics.
[comment]It was the moment he called Pelosi and admitted it. It was when on the South Lawn he called on Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens. No quid pro quo is mentioned in the law they are violating. 

The quid pro quo just indicates how evil the suspect is. It would be as if Bill Clinton told Monica millions of innocent people will die if you do not suck my dick. The impeachment is still over the lie to investigators. The heinousness of the crime just helps define the type of person you are dealing with. The quid pro quo should be considered another crime but not needed for the impeachment.

This line links to an article which states  
It doesn‚Äôt take many brain cells to comprehend the difference between a lie and a false or misleading statement. In addition

[comment]I remember when news programs were not subject to ratings to stay on the air. This was long before cable TV.  Part of being approved for a broadcasting license by the FCC was you had to provide news services. They all pretty much said the same thing and you watched the one you wanted. It's all about ratings now. Ratings equal money.  People watch the news program they agree with. It's sad but true

Realizing we need to control certain forms of hate speech and lies would vastly improve this country) means we can't deal with snake oil salesmen and traitorous news organizations the way we should be able to.
[comment]Yeah
I was just sort of pondering it to myself and wondering what the hell can be done about it. I remember reading long ago that there were some sort of laws or something that could be referenced to bring news back in line to some kind of actual journalistic integrity but nobody wants to legally open that can of worms because all the networks are guilty of editorializing and entertainment shows to fill their 24 hour news slots
Sorry
So
I was even imagining a bizarro future where CNN
Goober Republicans are actually watching these impeachment hearings and fooled by the ridiculous bullshit rhetoric dripping brown from the Republicans' lips. There's no hope for those people.

[comment]Cool[comment]Reading these comments...I wonder how many people have actually watched the Republicans questioning all the Impeachment "witnesses" and how many actually watched the IG's testimony?  
All the "evidence" the Dems offer up is in fact a bunch of hearsay.  Screaming something from the top of your lungs over and over and over doesn't make it true...no matter how bad you want it to be.

A better photo would be you sitting in an empty church pew. The photo is shot from behind you with the alter in the backdrop. Your head is slightly bowed and you have the Bible open to some poignant verse.

Also[comment]Yep. He didn't use tear gas on protesters because he wanted a photo-op. The tear gassing WAS the photo-op. He wanted to show his a big strong boy who can do big strong things.
[comment]Such a weird photo.  The backstory of how he got there
Then there is the fact that it is just a bad picture.  The composition is all wrong.  He isn‚Äôt expressing anything.  Nobody has any idea what he is trying to convey.  It is just a mess.  The best this administration could do was _that_.  That‚Äôs just pathetic.

[comment]Yea[comment]I feel as though these types of headlines are made to  play down the casual voting youth. If they already expect their candidate to win they won't take it as seriously. We need to quadruple down and act as though we are the underdogs until Biden is in office

[comment]I got banned for 24 hours today for calling someone who was lying an idiot.  Then I read about this and I realized what Facebook is doing.  If Democrats get the POTUS and majorities in the House and Senate there is a good chance that regulations on social media sites and companies will be pursued.  This means that Facebook will be liable for allowing false information and slander to he posted.  It could possibly lead to an end to political content on Facebook altogether.  At the same time the government needs to pass laws covering slander and libel in political advertising.  The simplest solution would be to have a board made up of citizens who fact-check content in a non-partisan manner.  And requiring that campaigns focus on the issues and any character issues that come up and are true and cause for concern should be reported to the FBI for investigation.
[comment]After the audio leak of Zuck not wanting a Warren presidency[comment]How about this. FUCK FB[comment]Is there a number to call to complain?

Thunderdome politics.      Facebook rules.      


This monopolistic influence on politics is why Facebook should be divided into 20 companies. This needs an ad on FB too
[comment]That's what the Left deserves
The GOP is sooo very quick to make up claims about bias in the media and bias on social networks like FB and Twitter even when there really isn't any.  So what do these companies do to counter it?  They bend over backwards to these right wing scumbags and let them post whatever stupid shit they want.  

And where are the Dems in all this?  They're out fighting amongst themselves because one candidate might be ever so slightly more liberal on one issue or ever so slightly not liberal enough on some other issue.  The Left is creating cracks within its base for the upcoming general election and missing the whole damn point that the GOP is positioning itself to essentially run propaganda on social media because its been playing the victim card for so long.

[comment]Biden is basically this cycle's Hillary. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he won the primary fairly handily[comment]    I dont see why FB doesn't sensor political stuff.  Unless they were making a ton of money that is worth the risk. 
    It was not that long ago news was sensored in western Canada on election night so people were not influenced by eastern Canadas results..  It is not censorship.  Having laws that limit content in regards to who leads you is in your best interests if it creates a fair playing field.  Due to the ease of lieing these days because of information overload.

[title]Fox News Poll: 54 percent of Americans said Trump should be impeached
[selftext]https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-poll-majority-americans-support-impeaching-donald-trump-removed-office-1477340[comment]This is a pretty big outlier when you look at 538 so let‚Äôs not get too excited.
[comment]The real problem is that the Senate is intentionally minoritarian but lacks the kind of thoughtfulness that should accompany such a terrible flaw in a governing body.
[comment]this is only Boomers with landlines right? I mean who are they polling? if it's 54%of the landline folks then it must be a great deal higher for us thinking individuals

[comment]Pence understands the thinking behind it because he's had the same exact thoughts with other viruses

No one contacted ebola in the US.  Can't say the same for the Coronavirus and trump[comment]I misread that as Don Jr saying he wished millions of dems died and was not the slightest bit surprised.
[comment]Do republicans get any dumber?
[comment]So in my purple state I should go to Repub districts and fake cough in line?
[comment]I also wish that millions of dems die[comment]Well
It's why the Democrats work so hard for affordable universal healthcare...so millions of Republican's die from a pandemic. It makes perfect sense!
[comment]This makes me sad.  The guy just doesn't understand that his side is doing what he is claiming the other side is doing.   Trump gets up at his first press conference about the outbreak and spends more time talking about the economy[comment]It's "understandable" because Don Jr is as idiotic as his dad.
[comment]And they say dems are the ones politicizing it...unbelievable.

If you've worked in customer service
If indeed they think Dems are politicizing the crisis as they claim (I only see demands for more leadership and action)[comment]So the Trump administration who did everything in their power to weaken the CDC and aid the spread of the coronavirus is accusing the dems of hoping it spreads?

[title]Tom Steyer Has Spent $47.6 Million on His Presidential Campaign. That Money Could Help Democrats in Hundreds of State Races
[selftext]https://time.com/5702476/tom-steyer-campaign-spending-state-races/[comment]Yeah this dude is an idiot.
[comment]Seriously. It‚Äôs great he wants to make some statements on TV[comment]I was just talking to another local dem after the local debate watching party this week about Steyer.  I‚Äôm not sure why he needs to be in the debates
But I also want to say that I live in a tiny coastal town and Steyer has absolutely been throwing his money behind local democrats all over the country.  A couple of years ago we had three of five seats open in our local port races
Thanks in part to the help of Steyer we won all three of those seats
So while I think there might be good reasons to question his candidacy[comment]He's got more.
[comment]His money would do better in the form of direct and in-kind contributions to Senate
He's proving he is not that self-aware running for President.
[comment]He figures if Trump did it maybe he has the same chance... same effect happens with the lottery and dumb people.
[comment]He could spend at least some of that on a better makeup artist[comment]That money‚Äôs not totally wasted[comment]Just imagine if Schultz had continued to run....
[comment]Mention it! He could do Billboards too.
[comment]Tom Steyer is a shithead.

He basically ran a competition to get the best Democratic candidate picked. When it came time to hand out the award[comment]I don‚Äôt trust this guy in the least bit. The fact his polling numbers spontaneously jump when the requirements for the debates do doesn‚Äôt help much either.
[comment]Being a billionaire is ethically indefensible. It's an error of capitalism[comment]Heck of a vanity project.
[comment]For that money he could have any congressional district he wanted.

Fucking idiot.
[comment]Assume it's tax deductible or something. These guys didn't get rich burning their own cash.
[comment]While his presidential campaign spending doesn't seem worth it

Rich people squandering their money means it re-enters the economy vs them hoarding it.  That's a good thing in my book.
[comment]I mean he offers nothing more than anyone else on stage and less than some and is late to the game so he probably has less than 5% chance of making it to the nomination. I dont dislike him but its honestly just a waste.
[comment]Don't bitch at this guy. He was putting ads everywhere at his own expense to wake fucking people up about the nightmare Trump administration.  Let him spend HIS money where he feels fit.
[comment]I get it
Do I think it's bullshit that (a) anyone has this kind of personal wealth to throw at an ego stroke? YES. (b) that is costs this much to run for office? YES. (c) that liberals love to hate on money in politics but turn a blind eye when it's 'their' candidate as well as the fact that if we really wanted change we would spend our money bottom up to build the base that would make Republican presidential candidates obsolete.
[comment]How does money and donations help a person campaign better than another? What‚Äôs it spent on?
[comment]Who?
[comment]We need him to be the candidate because he can destroy Trump.
[comment]He could have paid off the ‚Äúpoll tax‚Äù in Florida.
[comment]He has no chance. Democrats need to work together to overcome trump. He should put his $s to better use behind a stronger candidate
[comment]Who? Where is he spending the money[comment]Everyone complaining about him: would you rather he boarded his wealth and stayed silent about Trump because the GOP tax cut saved him millions?
[comment]Who is Tom Steyer?
[comment]Campaign spending is one of the largest economy boosters in America. I think people tend to forget
I think he is an important voice for the democratic party. The problem is[comment]who?
[comment]I've been following Steyer for some time along with a few other candidates.  And one of the reasons why is his commitment to a greener environment and to the young voters. I can honestly say that I'm impressed.  Do I think he will win. It's simply too early to tell. Because my vote has to really go to the best candidate who can beat Trump and I am simply not sure who that candidate will be yet. 
I do agree that that is a hell of a lot of money to spendHowever[comment]His ads and Bloomberg are blitzing the airwaves here. It‚Äôs a bit unsettling.

What an awesome potential ad for Bernie!
[comment]Aside from its relevance to impeachment[comment]Yes he has the power to fire her[comment]Its really weird hearing Trump string together coherent sentences and talk like a somewhat normal person.
[comment]I‚Äôve never before heard a conversation that smelled like hookers and cocaine.
[comment]Is that all it takes to get Trump to fire someone?  We should tell him we heard Betsy DeVos say he'll probably be removed from office.
[comment]I‚Äôm curious[comment]I noticed user Slakmehl‚Äôs post about this in r/worldnews which puzzles me a bit:


‚ÄúThe most astonishing thing here is that this appears to have been intentionally recorded with Trump's consent
 - At 42:00
 - Trump immediately and loudly responds *"Get her out. Get her out tomorrow"*
They made sure everyone in the room heard both parts of this exchange. They then pro-actively [leaked the cover story for Trump's reasoning](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-ordered-ukraine-ambassador-removed-after-complaints-from-giuliani-others-11570137147) to the Wall Street Journal in October.

This was all choreographed. They thought it would provide plausible deniability for the quid pro quo with Yuriy Lutsenko. **They believed this conversation would be exculpatory**
But the infamous call memorandum reveals that Trump was entirely knowledgeable of the plot with Lutsenko 
&gt;‚ÄúI heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that‚Äôs really unfair&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúA lot of people are talking about that
 - In the same phone call
&gt;In a telephone conversation that has set off a political crisis for Mr. Trump&gt;
&gt;**‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to go through some things
*(Edit: Removed mistaken assertion re: WH officials in the room
Is there any credibility to the assertion that this recorded conversation was choreographed?

[comment]This is one of those times when the 22nd amendment looks kind of bad.
[comment]I had almost forgotten what true leadership looked like.
[comment]What does this even mean?  What‚Äôs the advice?
[comment]so reassuring--this is they type of presidential behavior we neeed not that vapid air bag trump
[comment]And the poor who are one or two checks away from not being able to pay rent
[comment]oh my GOD barack please come the hell back here
[comment]*sigh* anybody remember when this man[comment]Class. Leadership. Obama.
[comment]I just recently watched his speech after winning the 2008 election[comment]‚ÄúWuhan virus ain‚Äôt nuthin to fuck wid.‚Äù

                     Barack Obama
[comment]He didn‚Äôt mention us electricity generators... could you imagine if we went home and neglected making power? It‚Äôs funny everyone forgets about those that make so many conveniences possible
[comment]Dat's my President!
[comment]I miss sanity
[comment]I miss having a president
[comment]Amazon logistics crew are bona fide heros
[comment]Support Bernie then[comment]Compare tweets like this to the dipshit currently in charge....
[comment]Man this guy is eloquent. It makes me sad: How can the country that elected this man be the same one that let trump become president
[comment]Look A real President speaks as any real President should ABT 2020
[comment]God[comment]It's time to thank Obama for instituting non-corporate universal healthcare so there is no class divide today when it comes to being tested and treated  for coronavirus......_oh wait...he didn't do that_... although he had 8 years to do so.

Sorry...nevermind.
[comment]Can he come back? The new guy sucks :(
[comment]I miss Obama.

I wish he would endorse Sanders as he knows joes limitations more than anyone.

I loved how in the debate they fought over Obama like he was a dog toy ha ha how wonderful was that. Two old white rich men fighting over the endorsement of a black mixed race younger man who in their life time had few to know rights.  Despite trump it's good to see how far we've come but bernie is right...we have so much further to go.
[comment]I miss him.

[comment]Holy shit they did everything they could to hinder a fair election and still Wisconsin pulled through.

Way to go!!
[comment]So glad I put my mask and gloves on and went to VOTE! Come on Wisconsin let‚Äôs turn out in November too!
[comment]Some good news is nice.

THE GOP HELD THE ELECTION BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD WIN THIS SEAT

[comment]Laughing at you[comment]Fuck yea she did!
[comment]That Wisconsin blue wave isn't messing around!
[comment]I needed some cheering news. Way to go blue Badgers!
[comment]Is anyone else waiting on the impending lawsuits from republicans about not being able to vote for something their own lawmakers did?
[comment]This is incredible! THANK YOU TO ALL THE VOTERS WHO RISKED THEIR HEALTH
You are an inspiration and it‚Äôs up to us to follow suit and kick these people out of office!
[comment]The Republicans pushed forward the election somehow forgetting their voters are the ones most susceptible to corona and most scared they will die from it.

They‚Äôre not going to turn out.
[comment]Need to flip 38 electoral votes for the win. Hopefully the Wisconsin blue wave is real deal Holyfield come November.
[comment]That‚Äôs great news. A little middle finger to the GOP.

[comment]This has me so optimistic for November. I‚Äôm almost crying from hope.

[comment]That's crazy.
[comment]WOW
[comment]Why is this like breaking news in my feed
[comment]The result breakdown also shows how "nonpartisan" elections become partisan anyway.
[comment]ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
[comment]They screwed themselves. Serves them right.
[comment]In the end - now it makes sense why they forced it.  They knew they were nuked in a fair race and it was a hail mary to save the seat.   

  

As a Michigander - you folks can have the UP to say thanks for getting this right.

[comment]Not if he gets voted out of office in November 2020!
[comment]I feel like we don‚Äôt talk enough about how Mitch blocked Obama‚Äôs Supreme Court pick. When he was still president. No election year should stop a president from doing his job.
[comment]This is not a prediction[comment]Next time there is a Democratic SCOTUS pick[comment]No shit
[comment]Republicans will do this every single time[comment]that's why we all need to vote him and the rest of his America hating colleagues out of office

[title]Trump Learned His Lesson: thanks to the obsequious Republican Senate[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/he-learned-his-lesson[comment]They sure showed us whose boss... PUTIN
[comment]Trump has Carte Blanche to do whatever he wants
The American empire is crumbling beneath their feet.

Never thought I‚Äôd see it happening but here we are!
[comment]man campaigns against figurehead republicans write themselves.

just show them giving their acquittal speech then list daily headlines of corruption before and after.

ignore the orange man. the senate is the problem of record.
[comment]We teach people how to treat us...
[comment]I refuse to believe 50 people are just so scared to lose that they‚Äôd betray the nation as these Republicans have.
[comment]Democrats handled it wrong. They should have started a litany of impeachment items after the meuller report. Now it just looks like they are grasping at straws instead of actually pursuing justice.

Pelosi is an idiot. We need a better House leader.
[comment]4 attorneys on the Stone case resigned. But it was a little hard for them to find the exists cause Barr relocated the DOJ up trumps ass.
[comment]I am so disappointed in them.
[comment]The man keeps on winning
[comment]Learned his lesson? He said he could shoot someone in the street and get away with it four fuxking years ago.

He didn't learn shit[comment]Yup[comment]We NEED TO VOTE
[comment]Democrats knew impeachment would fail and give Trump more power.
[comment]trump could have shot and killed a senator and they would still have voted to acquit 52 to 48
unless he killed a republican[comment]He can‚Äôt get away with doodle if he‚Äôs not re elected annnd the SDNY is waiting for him.
[comment]I want to see how many pardons he grants of his cronies.  Paul Manafort Roger Stone Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen are all on the list.
[comment]He‚Äôs the nations Dennis the menace!  What kinda trouble is he gonna get himself into next[comment]Vote Bernie!
[comment]And it looks like the Dems did not learn theirs (THAT THE GOP WILL LET THIS MAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS) and are calling for a resignation or impeachment of Barr. 

Letting Trump get away with interfering with Stone case is LESS damaging to the country and the future of the democracy than going after him and having the GOP do nothing in the senate. As OP's comment shows.
[comment]The Senate is complicit
They are acting as a cabal supporting a criminal. It is not just to further enrich the billionaires[comment]So democratic house wasnt being biased either?
[comment]Teflon Donny back on top yet again.  Have fun stepping over all that shit in the streets you Ol Frisco/Seattle/Portland/NYC/LA Democrat.  I‚Äôll take a picture for you from my muthafuckin wall.

Anyone who doesn't is an accomplice.
[comment]Isn't this sub censoring the rape accusations against Biden made by Tara Reade?

[comment]He won't succeed.  But some perspective as a centrist that is not supportive of how he runs the country; it's my strong opinion the mass 24*7 media outlets have lost their effing minds.  I can't get 15 minutes into watching CNN or MSNBC without Trump coming up.  They are negligent in their responsibility to report the news across the country and globe
I turn on BBC every now and then so I can get some actual damn news.  And more or less I've just stopped watching the news media in the US and only read news now.

Bring on the downvotes!  To be a centrist in the US is to be a pariah...LOL.
[comment]Cease and desist?

[comment]The most cowardly courageous thing ever done.
[comment]Lip service. He's gonna pretend to be open to hearing anything then vote the way the party tells him to.
[comment]Right on. Let's go.
[comment]We need three more! If you've got a Senator that may go for it [CALL them!]( https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)
[comment]Its all bullshit until he actually VOTES with democrats.  Its easy to SAY something.
[comment]We need two more besides him and Collins...
[comment]Need more senior Republicans to speak out. Where you at dubya?
[comment]Wow[comment]If only all the senators Trump bashed would be real men / women. Dude shat on war heros
[comment]Trump is not very popular in Utah believe it or not. With Mike Lee‚Äôs outburst over that meeting last week it may be a sign he might want to hear from Bolton too. We may have a couple unexpected defectors.
[comment]Maybe someone's planning on challenging the GOP nomination?
[comment]Even if Bolton Testifies he very likely will defend Trump‚Äôs actions. 

This is the guy who globally falsified the intelligence to create a flimsy justification for all of our currently uncontainable mid east excursions.

Bolton represents a hardcore and powerful line of US foreign policy that holds as its most basic doctrine the idea that we have to destabilize every other nation on earth
This is the theme of why we have destroyed any chance of social stability in Latin America and why we continue to destabilize the mid east regardless of actual energy concerns and solutions.  

At a tangent: One of the reasons alternate energy technology (solar
Carbon fuel is like an Operating System and these guys will do anything to ensure the rest of the world stays subserviently dependent upon our OS.

These two core intentions: Keep other competitive powers from arising and pay for that empiricism with dollar-reserve energy economy monopoly combine to outweigh any and every moral or legal roadblocks.

This GOP model has never been more powerful and less opposed. Bolton‚Äôs  legacy would be far too damaged by any participation in reducing the globally fascist wet dream that his ideology  now enjoys.  I think it is possible he will embarrass Pelosi and the Dems beyond anyone‚Äôs expectations.

[comment]I wouldn‚Äôt trust Trump to be a McDonald‚Äôs shift manager[comment]Yeah. Try to keep up.
[comment]That‚Äôs what happens when you lie all the time. People tend not to believe anything you say.
[comment]Don't depend on government that's for sure.  Aid packages so far are totally inadequate.  No surprise coming from over a decade of gridlock and self serving elected officials.
[comment]Any reasonable person doesn't trust anything Trump says.
[comment]It‚Äôs times like these when I would accept a person that listens to advisors and scientists in that position. Doesn‚Äôt even have to be a true leader or politician
Frankly it is unbelievable to me that some are still ok with him. Beyond that I miss Obama dearly and we would be in a much better position if Hillary were in office. 

Trump has been insanely lucky as a president to not have to have dealt with something like this. Granted[comment]The last two words were completely unnecessary.
[comment]Trump is basically the boy who cried wolf.  He has lied so many times[comment]The biggest DUH in the world.
[comment]He just had a press conference.  Instead of letting the experts speak he had to be front and center.  When the expert spoke he had to be close by to put his 2 cents in.  Attacking Democratic leaders because ‚Äú they don‚Äôt play fair‚Äù WTF is that supposed to mean?  A question was posed why they didn‚Äôt use WHO testing that was already available they said it gave too many false positives.  Really a test the whole world is using is not good enough.  I feel these tests would tell the truth the virus has been here for weeks and Trump doesn‚Äôt want us to know the large number of people who are sick already.
[comment]Big surprise[comment]After 16[comment]My wife told me that there was a press conference about the virus today. 

Told her I‚Äôd wait until everything he said was fact-checked and get the info from news sites later. I don‚Äôt trust him at all.

[comment]Trump speaks[comment]His failure of leadership here is literally going to get people killed.  #Republicansarelethal #Orangeplague
[comment]I trust the media less.
[comment]World Health Organization or your local health department.  Federal government is a complete let down on this one.
[comment]Fuck. I don't trust or believe anything i hear from that orange shitstain.
[comment]And yet an NBC poll showed 48% thinking he is doing a good job with the pandemic. WTF is wrong with people?
[comment]Wow... Imagine that! Somebody lies more often than they say truthful things and people don't trust them when they speak. I'm stunned...
[comment]Thank God I have a sane Dem Gov. to listen to. I only listen to LOCAL news because they make sense and Don't lie or sugarcoat anything.  I MUTE TRUMP OR TURN CHANNEL.

This whole failure of leadership is because you have a complete failure and fraud surrounded by sycophants and enablers.  Work like hell to get him out of office in 2020.
[comment]Not if we vote his ass out in November and then prosecute him for his crimes...
[comment]This is wishful thinking.  Trump has consistently out done previous scandals with more fantastic ones.  Trump's time in office is far from over.  I have no doubt he will have a propaganda scandal  that will eclipse this one.
[comment]No shit..
[comment]Sometimes I wish he‚Äôd choke on his tongue to keep him quiet.
[comment]Damn maybe every major news publication shouldnt air his lies every single day? Sounds like he is winning this battle easily thanks to the media's compliance.
[comment]Take this down the upvotes don‚Äôt work.
[comment]He's already won the propaganda battle. His supporters are the loudest most unswayable idiots ever. I can't believe some of the bullshit and fact denying and hanging on every word and believing anything that comes out against someone who is a democrat. It's imbedded itself in the fiber of our country. The only way to fight it is with stinger messaging on Facebook using immoral tactics. So that is why they won't be deprogramed. The best of us won't win.

[comment]No[comment]Trump's an idiot in all things of the mind Except his genius of using TV and Diversion. The whole China Wuhan Virus Lab thing is taking off now. And his faction (Fox Nation etc) comes up with Diversions -- a dozen a week. They just throw them on the media wall and follow the ones that stick. 

Us honestAs long as the stock market rebounds and churches and Netflix keeps them entertained all's well with Trumpistan.
[comment]News about Trump is already beginning to enrage me! I hope that this person can no longer do anything bad to people. To whom it is interesting to learn more about the situation with the virus - I recommend Covid-19 chat in the Utopia P2P application
[comment]I wonder what percentage of his base buys the propaganda while at the same time if they scrolled back on their social media feed to February and early March they were posting dumb shit about how it's no big deal.
[comment]And his supporters will thank him endlessly for being so heroic and decisive in these troubling times.

[comment]Would love her but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it would help him win[comment]It's weird that the news media seems obsessed with pretending Kamala Harris doesn't exist and isn't a strong possibility.

[comment]She is wonderful but she doesn't really have much experience. She should run for the Senate first.

[comment]Does anyone know where she stands on the issues? I know her position on voting rights[comment]I don't think Stacey Abrams should be the VP choice. Being the minority leader of Georgia's legislature doesn't qualify you to be President or Vice President. Furthermore her voting rights work is more important than anything she could do as VP.
[comment]I would say she had a chance but with the pandemic[comment]I think Bernie might be a tactical choice for for VP. Many people who got excited for Bernie feel like Biden doesn't represent what they want (and don't get me wrong
I just think that Biden has not managed to convince those people who want to see a change in politics and saw that in Bernie.

And you can argue that "they have to vote for Biden or Trump will win" No they don't. They don't have to do anything. It's a free country. To them Trump won when Bernie suspended his campaign. Make them believe other vice.

November 2007[comment]IMHO - this is partially due to name recognition.    


My guess is who ever wins the Dem will move ahead.  Then the Rep will start their negative campaign to lower them.  Turn out will be the key to victory.  Can the Dem energize people to go vote.  Trump will for sure.
[comment]I think 538 even posted a poll where warren loses to trump in Nevada. We can‚Äôt be in a position where we have to worry about Nevada[comment]What about Sanders?
[comment]There are many paths for our victory. But Biden's is the easist for us.
[comment]I like Warren and I feel like she could win but she needs to change her MFA plan to an "opt in" one. I understand why her plan bans private insurance and I agree with her in principal but it is an absolute loser of a campaign plan. Americans are afraid enough of what MFA means because it's new. They will be doubly scared if you told them they couldn't even buy their own private insurance even if they wanted to. Not to mention there are hundreds of thousands of people directly or indirectly employed by private insurance. They will be terrified of losing their jobs in one flat swipe when she is elected. Add all that to the millions that will be spent by the healthcare lobby against Warren's plan and I fear it will be too much. Offering an "Opt In" is honestly the most electable plan. It's the easiest to explain to voters and it's an easily understandable concept to the millions of people who would be very nervous about being told their private insurance is going away.

This guy is their future candidate and the only viable replacement for trump  right now but he spent the last 3 years silent and under the thrall. Until he s conveniently standing up to trump and Mitch but not enough to effect the impeachment acquittal...conveniently.  

No i dont buy that he grew a backbone. He is being allowed to do this shit to appeal to the growing majority of Republcians who simple don't like trump and so need to feel they have party representation.

The only reason they want to kill it is because of racism because they always vilified Obama.

[comment]I can answer that. They‚Äôre willing to overlook such indiscretions for the greater good. Imagine if/when he defeats the inquiry and wins 2020[comment]Where did you pull this FAKE BULLSHIT out of?
[comment]Maybe it's not so much that they support all of the Republican policies or candidates
I've been reading reddit posts for a week now and what stands out to me is how out of touch the response from liberals is. They attack and lash out but they don't take the time to to try to understand why someone has a different point of view. Instead it's just mocking anyone who doesn't already agree. Then they can't figure out why they lose elections.

I'm an independent
None of this even addresses the way the left hates everyone not left. The party of inclusion only wants to include people who agree. Everyone else is some kind of horrible person who easily fits under a label.  Which will probably show up if I get any responses.

[comment]This article is a good description of specific characters from both parties.  Additionally[comment]MAGAtosis
[comment]Trumpism def is
[comment]I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a mental disorder as much as it‚Äôs a lack of exposure to other cultures
This lack of exposure creates a mindset that lacks empathy for people who aren‚Äôt from similar backgrounds.
[comment]Trumpian/Foxian conservatism is indeed a mental disorder. However[comment]The only true political system that has worked is kekistan and it is magnificent
[comment]I like this.
[comment]Lack of empathy is sociopathic so I'll say yes
[comment]No no no
Just leave it alone.
[comment]Well they argue with scientists over everything. These people have no idea what they are talking about but will tell someone who has been studying it and working on it for 20 years that they know more than them. So yes. They are mentally ill.
[comment]Short answer: no
[comment]Soon we will have made all of our voters walk away over b.s. like this and recreational victimhood.

[title]Texas Republican Guv Privately Admitted Reopening Economy Will Lead To More COVID Cases
[selftext]https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/texas-governor-privately-admits-reopening-economy-more-covid-cases-abbott[comment]As a Texan I hate this guy. Worst part of our state.
[comment]Then why re-open?
[comment]Abbott is a piece of diseased bat shit
[comment]This isn't breaking or anything
Reps are morally bankrupt nutcases[comment]As a working class person you are meat for the grinder.
[comment]As a Texan and Democrat I despise this guy; but what he's saying is accurate on all points. The purpose of the stay at home order is to keep the infection rate below the capacity of the health care system (AKA flatten the curve). By *slowly* reopening he's banking on the infection rate to remain *manageable* within the context of available ventilators and critical care beds. He's wrong[comment]Honest question just because I keep seeing this story everywhere. 

Did people not know this already? 

I thought this was common knowledge and people were now debating the economic costs of re-opening VS. the human cost.  Is that not the case?

Were some people unaware that re-opening *guarantees* more Covid cases? Did some people think the virus was just "over"?
[comment]Why is it that pretty much every time someone in power does something to hurt average Americans and benefit the rich
Even more importantly[comment]Well yes i thought everyone knows that.   Shelter in place doesnt magically make the virus disappear. Just slows down infections.   But once we open up they will ofcourse speed up again.   Duh ?
[comment]It also won't fix the economy.  Consumers are too scared to shop and employees don't want to go to work to get sick
The only path forward is testing and tracking
We will have waves of reopening
[https://www.businessinsider.com/how-contact-tracing-works-to-stop-coronavirus-spread-2020-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-contact-tracing-works-to-stop-coronavirus-spread-2020-4)
[comment]As a native Texan[comment]He needs a cactus up his rump!
[comment]Yes
So the fuck what? We already knew that. The question is how many cases and what we do to continue slowing it through public policy and health policy.

We are in a no-win scenario here. Stay locked down forever and we start wrecking the economy to the point that we can't produce food and necessities (never mind that the people we have NOT locked down are the ones making our food for us. Oops.) On the other hand
We can mitigate and slow it down
[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-19-cidrap-viewpoint](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/covid-19-cidrap-viewpoint)

I don't mean to be fatalistic[comment]In other news[comment]Well NO SHIT.  Jeez.
[comment]Is anyone claiming otherwise?
[comment]I don't see any issue with him saying this[comment]I love how the Gop admits they're going to make matters worse in private[comment]Of course it will. That‚Äôs a given at this point. Donald Trump acted too slow[comment]I don't think any of the pro-coronavirus people deny this. They just think short term economic gain is more important than lives.
[comment]The problem isn't that he's wrong[comment]Should be obvious that if contacts between people goes up that infection must also go up.
[comment]And hopefully more deaths. A third of the population would be a good start.
[comment]So the almighty dollar trumps people's lives in Texass....

Chuck Todd could moderate a murder and believe he had to be fair to the murderer and ignore the victim.  Republicans demand approval of his main questions up front and threaten not to return if he asks follow-up questions that make them look bad.  Chuck Todd is the anti-Tim Russert.  He's go along

Treason should apply to trade wars and cyber attacks fro foreign entities. The law can't remain tied to the declaration of war when we have 8+ wars on going

Remember in the 80s when conservative (mainly Southern) Democrats became Republicans because the Democratic Party embraced civil rights fully?  It's payback time.  The Republican Party has embraced an extremist right agenda and it needs to be rejected outright by the remaining people with a moral center who once knew the party of Abraham Lincoln as progressive.

It doesn't matter who becomes President as long as the Republicans control the Senate. McConnell has blocked every Democratic bill while rushing through unqualified judges.

[title]Senate Republicans Contradict Trump on Russian Interference. Even His Loyalists Acknowledge It Happened
[selftext]https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/senate-intelligence-committee-trump-russia.html?via=homepage_taps_top[comment]They acknowledge[comment]I wonder if this is the start of a turnaround.

One can only hope
Not getting paid = Attack the guy responsible.
[comment]His supporters know too. They've known this is true and real all along
They chose loyalty to a man over loyalty to their party or their country. 

They represent a heavy third of the public.

What can we do now?

[comment]The meat of this story is that the evidence must be so overwhelming that they can‚Äôt possibly deny it.  You gotta think that the vast majority of the ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù was trying to figure out how to deny it and wash it away.
[comment]O really?  Can we acknowledge that he's an illegitamate president due to intereference and cheated his way to the red house?

[title]Republicans Spent the First Day of Impeachment Hearings in an Alternate Reality
[selftext]https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/republicans-spent-the-first-day-of-impeachment-hearings-in-an-alternate-reality/[comment]Yeah whats with bringing up Obama and military aid to Ukraine[comment]Gaslight   &lt;- we are

Obstruct

Project   &lt;- mostly here
[comment]Nunes and Jordan can eat dicks.


Waaaaaaait a second...I just thought of a solution
[comment]They‚Äôre not trying to convince anyone. They must want voters to dismiss the whole thing as a circus and say both parties are the same.
[comment]The overall strategy is to make everything so dry or nonsensical that purple change the channel. Hence[comment]The house dems are clearly running an idiotic sham. Someone said someone said[comment]My favorite part is where Jordan (what a guy!/s) claimed that Trump was checking to see if Ukraine‚Äôs President was corrupt and because he didn‚Äôt do as Trump asked he was cool. 
__like the whole thing was a shit test! XD__
[comment]Republicans have spent decades creating and honing an Alternate Reality for themselves and their flock to live in...
[comment]Why should they act any differently than they normally do these days? We should expect them to change. 

We should only expect them to pay.
[comment]Since Reagan with his "Morning In America" (it wasn't)[comment]Oh yes and the Trumpt~~ards~~  fans have been alll over social media today in full attack mode with "this is a coup" and "you'd better hope he's not impeached (or else)" and "thanks for making sure he gets reelected" and "presidente for life" and all that shit. It's funny to watch them get so worked up and I wonder if they aren't going to just have a stroke en masse.
[comment]Republicans have spent the last three years in an alternate reality
[comment]Half of America is in an alternate reality and we need to find a way to bring a few of them back to build a durable[comment]A snoozefest?  They laid it out in plain English.  Trump has asked  a foreign power for a public investigation against a  political rival. He doesn't understand how bad that is because he doesn't really understand our Constitution or our government. He definitely is no student of history.  He is a rich kid who avoided Vietnam with his Father's money. He is a Con-man. He is a total fool.

We should have started impeachment the first year he was in office. I understand that we couldn't do anything without the Senate.  But he is just so awful. This is so egregious that even though we can't remove him and it will probably cause political damage
I feel sorry for (can't stand)  the Boomers and the young White Nationalists who still support him.  Fox News is very powerful
It is just like 1930's Germany.  Hitler came to power with popular support. I can't believe the Boomers don't see the parallels.  

Still they listen to Rush. Hate immigrants  (which we all are)  and hate the people who need government assistance.  Of course they don't see their Medicare or Social security as assistance. Or any Corporation receiving assistance- boosting their dividends-that doesn't count.   Of course they hate poor people.  It is so sad.  They will hate their grandchildren- all college graduates
My parents are constantly asking me what will the kids will eventually do?  Hell
Hell- it doesn't exist for me.  I have never worked for a company that had any retirement. and I am 55.  

If I didn't take it out of my paycheck
So YES Republicans are in an alternate reality.  And I don't know how to help any of them.  I have begged my parents to stop watching FOX News[comment]The Republicans spend the entirety of everyday in an alternate reality. "Alternative facts" were the embodiment of GOP nonsense. There is a neverending supply of alternate reality with the GOP.
[comment]Jim Jordan embarrassed himself badly. Why did the GOP  bring him in to speak? He's nuts.
[comment]Claimed he was too busy to watch it! His tweets are a running commentary. Busy?
[comment]Jordan and Nunes must die... politically.
[comment]I kept hoping the ambassador would push back asking them why they were asking questions that had nothing to do with him. Wtf did they bring up Obama?
[comment]They're just throwing spaghetti and using whatever sticks.
[comment]Republican voters are also in an alternate reality. A Republican Facebook friend wrote ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only one truth.‚Äù I make a policy never to respond to opposing political comments unless they‚Äôre in something I‚Äôve posted[comment]The 60something dude living across from me has taken to wearing his MAGA hat everywhere. He thinks shit is just going swimmingly for his boy lol.
[comment]I liked when the one witness was asked "are you a Never-Trumper?" His response was "I'm a career non-professional..." LOL[comment]Apparently WH aids were tell trump the hearing turned out pretty good for him[comment]As if his escapades at OSU weren‚Äôt enough[comment]If they were in a courtroom
They were deep in conspiracy theory mode.  If Ukraine were interfering with American elections in 2016
They're making shit up to fit a narrative.  They can't defend Trump and his actions
These are dangerous times thanks to the modern Republican Party.
[comment]Doubt it. I‚Äôm in Alabama. They‚Äôre too engrained in the white nationalist propaganda
[comment]Republicans always live in an alternate reality

[title]When you hear about Melania using hyperbole how Barron has been violated. Remember here she is smiling with an orphaned baby whose parents were shot as a direct result of her husband's demagoguery
[selftext]https://twitter.com/shannonrwatts/status/1202354025863102464[comment]She's just as obnoxious as her husband.
I agree that the president's children should be left out of the ridicule[comment]Oh[comment]No disrespect to women when I say this....but FUCK that bitch
[comment]Barron is a state of being
[comment]Some Mothers eat their young.
[comment]Since ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù[comment]I REALLY DON‚ÄôT CARE[comment]Melania is complicit. I used to feel kind of sorry for her but her true colors have come out and she is just as nasty as her Orange husband. Making bullying her "platform " is just a slap in the entire country's face.
[comment]You people are fucking sick
[comment]Remember when the parents were Trump supporters? And they got what they deserved for supporting Trump and his fucked up policies?
[comment]When she says Barron has been violated she means herself.
[comment]So now the right care about how the child of an illegal immigrant is treated?
[comment]She's from Slovenia not Slovakia. She a spy.
[comment]I hate to say this because he is a child but he has no chance of growing up to be a decent him an being. He will be a piece of trash like every other member of his family. Poor (rich) kid.
[comment]Hunter Biden is a POS. 
Did he run for offense? NO 

MT‚Äôd BE Best only serves HER when it‚Äôs convenient
[comment]That seems unusually articulate for her. Does she run her own twitter?
[comment]Can‚Äôt even!!!!!!  
Trying to USE YOUR SON BARRON TO get a pass??? 
WHILE THOUSANDS of kids are CAGED BECAUSE OF YOU (note: you do NOT get a pass bc of your husband/spouse) 

REPEAT:Fuck you Melania
[comment]Fox News and many Republicans are going to overreact to the professors comment to take the news away from the hearing. And then discredit the professor and democrats. It‚Äôs going to be annoying[comment]Oh so Barron was violated and Republicans are having a fit. Yes he's tall but only 13 years old and just a kid. Yeah well so was Trayvon Martin he was also just a tall kid and where is he? Six foot under so give me a break with all the whining.
[comment]The party that puts babies in cages doesn't give a shit about children. Their attacks on this Barron bullshit are bad faith and shouldn't be taken seriously.
[comment]Lets remember that we cant see Trumps tax returns[comment]Let's not forget...her husband gave a big thumbs up for orphaning that child.
[comment]She and he used Barron as the prop for his failed vape ban. When you use your kid to set policy your kid becomes fair game.

When I was a soldier I was able to absentee vote through the mail just fine. If it's good enough for soldiers[comment]Good... 
I've lived in both TN and now live in NC. Throughout much of rural Appalachia people depend on mail-in ballots as polling places are distanced further and further apart[comment]Elderly Republicans are ‚Äúconfused [and] afraid.‚Äù No fucking shit.
[comment]Washington State has had mail-in ballots for many years without any problem.

While I do miss the awesome Bake Sales at the neighborhood polling station[comment]In Wisconsin in order to request an absentee ballot you need to either call your city clerk and have them send you an application form which must be mailed back to the clerk and then the clerk sends you your ballot which must be again mailed back. The deadline to have your request submitted (not to submit the application request) is a week before the election and the ballot itself must be received by election day. The alternative is to go online and submit an electronic request which involves taking a picture of your photo ID and attaching it to the request form.

The first method can take weeks to complete and involves inflexible deadlines while the second requires internet access and basic computer proficiency (older versions of internet explorer are not permitted). The second method makes it much harder for poorer people as well as elderly people to vote and the first requires a high degree of preplanning.

I think this is one of the reasons the GOP suffered so heavily in Wisconsin. By the time their GOTV efforts kicked into place the time table to request ballots by mail had largely passed forcing Republicans to try to coach elderly voters through a complicated computer system or vote on election day. The Dems[comment]Why do democrats think any change in voting procedure is a direct attack on them? Why do you still not have voter ID laws is the real question.

So why is Bannon sharing  an opinion that the Dems would agree with?  And why now? Trump and the alt right have been talking about the Deep State forever[comment]In the Mueller Report
Bannon considers Russia the enemy so would not go along with any of the treasonous actions others did.

[title]Meera Tanden: I genuinely do not understand why any candidate for the Dem nominee attacks Obama[selftext]https://twitter.com/neeratanden/status/1193727801779728385?s=09[comment]Tldr: for some reason Pete Buttigieg decided the best thing to do to help his campaign was to shoot it in the head.
[comment]what's hard to understand? since Biden's whole value proposition is he's Obama Part II
I think it's stupid[comment]I agree the wording is really bad but I believe Mayor Pete was trying to make a distinction between going back to "the good ole days" and actually fighting to make comprehensive and lasting progressive change in this country
[comment]Remember that time Obama tried to decrease the debt in the midst of a recession by negotiating against himself with a party that was never going to negotiate back?

Or that time he pretended he couldn‚Äôt do anything about immigration because he thought he was exerting pressure on republicans to act when they were never going to negotiate back
Come‚Äôon y‚Äôall. I really like Obama but he did have his flaws and it‚Äôs a bit dumb to pretend they didn‚Äôt exist.
[comment]It's true though. I like Obama but he led to Trump. I don't fault him because I don't expect him to be omniscient but I think he (and maybe many of us still) didn't quite understand the frustration of people with HS degrees or lower that Trump was able to flip.
[comment]It is also messed up on a personal level. GOP are still attacking him 16 years on[comment]None of this even happened. Reporter Evan Halper didn‚Äôt write down the correct words
https://twitter.com/evanhalper/status/1193852080903065600?s=21
