Lol... God, first link on Google. Wrong!

https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-social-mobility-of-82-countries/ Ya, I don't think many people in the usa do that. There's a republican subreddit if you are unaware. Trololol you're so salty.  Delicious. Trump has signed into law more gun restrictions than Obama did in his entire presidency. Yes i hump my guns even caress them in the midst of passion and love making. And your beliefs in conservatives deserving the mockery of whats going on is a reason this country will never be united. You are part of the problem. I know right? We all know wearing a tan suit and having a fit wife is the REAL pathetic behaviour. Then why are there Russian import bans? Why does Beto and Other Democrats promise to ban. Why is there the unconstitutional ATF/NFA? On technicalities alone all gun laws go against the constitution. I agree not everyone needs to own certain firearms but to ban  them is wrong. I dont have a problem with background checks or even the tax stamps. I just disagree with the bans altogether. If we prove to be sane and dont have any felonies or dui’s we should be capable of owning whatever. Millions is wasted on these bills and bans on gun control when it should go to proper health thats all. Not looking to fight with anyone. Just trying to educate. There is always going to be violence and dishonesty within the world. But if we stop blaming inanimate objects for doing wrong when its the users fault. Extreme ownership. Own up to your faults and hold others accountable (respectfully) to theirs. If someone points out that you screwed up. Check your ego and own up to your fault. You dont blame a hammer when you hit your thumb instead of the nail. You blame your dumbass and get back to work. Only ones spreading hate are you pathetic lot. Again, the level of social mobility just is not present. You do not go from earning <10000 to over 250000 in 10 years in Canada. \#1 And MOST IMPORTANT - accept the reality that either Joe Biden or Donald Trump will be the President come January 2021. There is no possible third outcome. By accepting that you then have to put all your energy into electing Biden. You have to vote and you have top get your friends to vote. 

\#2 We HAVE TO RETAKE THE SENATE. For us to undo as much of the damage Trump has done requires that we control both houses of Congress and the White House. Yes, there are many legitimate issues we have with Biden and the Democratic Party but to spend time on them now is to strengthen the GOP. If there was ever a time to be a unified voice sweet flaming Jesus THIS IS THAT TIME. Is that why you are camping out in this subreddit, hoping to spread hate just before you crawl back under your bridge to lick the boot of your fascist president? I'd take alot of countries over the usa, including Canada. Because we don’t want your gun humping dogma as a way of an attempt at deflection from the point of the protests and what’s going on.

And conservatives right now deserve derision. Conservatives already back gun rights. So why beat a dead horse. And they clearly need mental health being who our president is lol What a pathetic lot you all are. Trump is pretty much the [Supply side Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8xU-gKK17A). No democrats want to take your guns. Many democrats own guns, especially in my home state of Wisconsin. 


We are not the ones being authoritarian, that would be the guy who teargassed and flashbanged members of a church in DC yesterday so he could get a photo op of himself standing outside holding a bible upside down. This is America. It's not a new problem. Since our country was founded, we've been divided by race. We've systematically taken away rights of people who aren't like us. We've had authoritarians running ostensibly democratic governments to perpetuate racism.

For a moment, we had a black president. Racism wasn't fixed, but we could see ourselves making progress. Then along came that racial reactionary toddler we have in the White House at the moment.

We can only hope we come out of this with a rejuvenated sense of racial equality. And fight for that we must. For context, my parents are Indian. My ancestors grew up in slums, earning 1000 dollars a year or less, living in shacks, working meal to meal, wearing rags. My grandpa had to slog his ass off nearly working himself to death to work his way up in a factory with dismal conditions and finally take ownership. Why? So he could send my dad to high shcool and so he could come to college here. 20 years later and we're not rich, but very well off leading a comfortable life.

Nowhere else in the world could a story like this be possible. Nowhere else can a family come here and live in a one bedroom apartment with one bag of clothes and no money and finally work hard to get a good life. This type of social mobility is impossible in most of asia, and much of the rest of the world as well. So other average people in other countries are dying of hunger, getting into literal slavery, doing backbreaking work in mines - they do NOT have it better than us. My family's neighbors have NO food right now. My dad's best friend who he grew up with is literally unable to provide for his family right now. But here, we have stimulus checks, stable jobs, etc. 

My life was never easy, but I'm thankful beyond words for living here. Instead of complaining about "benefiting the rich" and other meta level stuff complaining about the people at the top, our story is proof that hard work really pays off with the american dream. And we know who always has to approve it the divider-in-chief himself. Get this shit out of here until you can say the same to conservatives first. .#MarriageGoals He's an idiot. Don't overthink it. Cops:  "We were just following orders" From the link:

Thoughts? Trump basically is satan, I know!! But we really can't go around insulting each other and getting pissed. I agree...on behalf of George Floyd, Eric Gardner, etc...

The question is... how do we make it happen? Which is why neither should be president. It's bull shit. It's also not too late to get someone better. I just hate everyone washing over it and not holding Biden to account. Why does he get a free pass? He also helped write the patriot act which further militarized the police. Biden is not with BLM or poc in this and its sad to see the media white wash his role. My fiance and I teared up during this speech. It's been three long and exhausting years since we had a speech befitting of a president, and when we finally got one it felt like a massive weight was being lifted off of my shoulders. 

This was a fantastic speech, I fully believe that Biden had what it takes to best Trump come November. This was truly an election defining speech. We'll see To your first question, yes it probably will make profit in one way or another..

Conspiracy: I am happy to hear anything against it.

Rioting: I believe rioting comes mostly from anger and the feeling of not 
treated fairly by society. The most shameful stunt *so far*. Such destain. And Trump can't even do a real smile. The whole family is just.... wretched. And wrong. Like they're playing human beings and half assing it. And guess which Vermont congressman voted for it? Anything to get that vote back lol Well now that he has weighed in, the powers that be won’t have any choice but to change police institutions and the direction of the flow of capital. Will Switzerland act as a smuggler and banker for their new fascist overlord like they did 80 years ago? Will they seize minority assets for themselves? 

You’re being an alarmist and conspiracy theorist. The rioting and looting is largely because humans act like idiots when they get into large groups. It’s not any one group. It’s just humans in general. https://i0.wp.com/mk0webretailer1u87a1.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/International-Returns-Options.jpg?resize=350%2C200&ssl=1 Legally, it’s not over until he puts her back in her original packaging and returns her to the vendor.  

Via FedEx probably, given how much he hates the USPS. ? Becuase he is doing/saying anything to garner votes. He will get elected and go back on his word.( damn chicago politics really took a toll on me) Everything is done to benefit the rich at the top of government. I'm no better off today than I was 20 years ago.

I think people in the usa don't understand how good the average person has it in other countries. Wow, you don't understand that pro lifers will vote republican even if Satan himself is the candidate? Wow. eh? BOT Do you ever get the feeling that marriage is long over with? >Those were good times... 

... when our president wasn’t trying to kill us with clorox injections, police dominance, and by defunding and rejecting scientists’ guidance on handling a pandemic. But Biden literally wrote the bill that caused all of this. He has yet to apologize. Words are less than actions. I'm so stressed as a Democrat. I feel like I'm a prisoner to hate and trickery with Biden as the candidate.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act VOTE this TURD out!!!! Biden wrote the crime bill that fueled the precedent Reagan started....

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act Good speech Yeah, I remember when we had an adult in the Oval Office.
