Lol... God, first link on Google. Wrong!

https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-social-mobility-of-82-countries/ Ya, I don't think many people in the usa do that. There's a republican subreddit if you are unaware. Trololol you're so salty.  Delicious. Trump has signed into law more gun restrictions than Obama did in his entire presidency. Yes i hump my guns even caress them in the midst of passion and love making. And your beliefs in conservatives deserving the mockery of whats going on is a reason this country will never be united. You are part of the problem. I know right? We all know wearing a tan suit and having a fit wife is the REAL pathetic behaviour. Then why are there Russian import bans? Why does Beto and Other Democrats promise to ban. Why is there the unconstitutional ATF/NFA? On technicalities alone all gun laws go against the constitution. I agree not everyone needs to own certain firearms but to ban  them is wrong. I dont have a problem with background checks or even the tax stamps. I just disagree with the bans altogether. If we prove to be sane and dont have any felonies or dui’s we should be capable of owning whatever. Millions is wasted on these bills and bans on gun control when it should go to proper health thats all. Not looking to fight with anyone. Just trying to educate. There is always going to be violence and dishonesty within the world. But if we stop blaming inanimate objects for doing wrong when its the users fault. Extreme ownership. Own up to your faults and hold others accountable (respectfully) to theirs. If someone points out that you screwed up. Check your ego and own up to your fault. You dont blame a hammer when you hit your thumb instead of the nail. You blame your dumbass and get back to work. Only ones spreading hate are you pathetic lot. Again, the level of social mobility just is not present. You do not go from earning <10000 to over 250000 in 10 years in Canada. \#1 And MOST IMPORTANT - accept the reality that either Joe Biden or Donald Trump will be the President come January 2021. There is no possible third outcome. By accepting that you then have to put all your energy into electing Biden. You have to vote and you have top get your friends to vote. 

\#2 We HAVE TO RETAKE THE SENATE. For us to undo as much of the damage Trump has done requires that we control both houses of Congress and the White House. Yes, there are many legitimate issues we have with Biden and the Democratic Party but to spend time on them now is to strengthen the GOP. If there was ever a time to be a unified voice sweet flaming Jesus THIS IS THAT TIME. Is that why you are camping out in this subreddit, hoping to spread hate just before you crawl back under your bridge to lick the boot of your fascist president? I'd take alot of countries over the usa, including Canada. Because we don’t want your gun humping dogma as a way of an attempt at deflection from the point of the protests and what’s going on.

And conservatives right now deserve derision. Conservatives already back gun rights. So why beat a dead horse. And they clearly need mental health being who our president is lol What a pathetic lot you all are. Trump is pretty much the [Supply side Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8xU-gKK17A). No democrats want to take your guns. Many democrats own guns, especially in my home state of Wisconsin. 


We are not the ones being authoritarian, that would be the guy who teargassed and flashbanged members of a church in DC yesterday so he could get a photo op of himself standing outside holding a bible upside down. This is America. It's not a new problem. Since our country was founded, we've been divided by race. We've systematically taken away rights of people who aren't like us. We've had authoritarians running ostensibly democratic governments to perpetuate racism.

For a moment, we had a black president. Racism wasn't fixed, but we could see ourselves making progress. Then along came that racial reactionary toddler we have in the White House at the moment.

We can only hope we come out of this with a rejuvenated sense of racial equality. And fight for that we must. For context, my parents are Indian. My ancestors grew up in slums, earning 1000 dollars a year or less, living in shacks, working meal to meal, wearing rags. My grandpa had to slog his ass off nearly working himself to death to work his way up in a factory with dismal conditions and finally take ownership. Why? So he could send my dad to high shcool and so he could come to college here. 20 years later and we're not rich, but very well off leading a comfortable life.

Nowhere else in the world could a story like this be possible. Nowhere else can a family come here and live in a one bedroom apartment with one bag of clothes and no money and finally work hard to get a good life. This type of social mobility is impossible in most of asia, and much of the rest of the world as well. So other average people in other countries are dying of hunger, getting into literal slavery, doing backbreaking work in mines - they do NOT have it better than us. My family's neighbors have NO food right now. My dad's best friend who he grew up with is literally unable to provide for his family right now. But here, we have stimulus checks, stable jobs, etc. 

My life was never easy, but I'm thankful beyond words for living here. Instead of complaining about "benefiting the rich" and other meta level stuff complaining about the people at the top, our story is proof that hard work really pays off with the american dream. And we know who always has to approve it the divider-in-chief himself. Get this shit out of here until you can say the same to conservatives first. .#MarriageGoals He's an idiot. Don't overthink it.

Thoughts? Trump basically is satan, I know!! But we really can't go around insulting each other and getting pissed. I agree...on behalf of George Floyd, Eric Gardner, etc...

The question is... how do we make it happen? Which is why neither should be president. It's bull shit. It's also not too late to get someone better. I just hate everyone washing over it and not holding Biden to account. Why does he get a free pass? He also helped write the patriot act which further militarized the police. Biden is not with BLM or poc in this and its sad to see the media white wash his role. My fiance and I teared up during this speech. It's been three long and exhausting years since we had a speech befitting of a president, and when we finally got one it felt like a massive weight was being lifted off of my shoulders. 

This was a fantastic speech, I fully believe that Biden had what it takes to best Trump come November. This was truly an election defining speech. We'll see To your first question, yes it probably will make profit in one way or another..

Conspiracy: I am happy to hear anything against it.

Rioting: I believe rioting comes mostly from anger and the feeling of not 
treated fairly by society. The most shameful stunt *so far*. Such destain. And Trump can't even do a real smile. The whole family is just.... wretched. And wrong. Like they're playing human beings and half assing it. And guess which Vermont congressman voted for it? Anything to get that vote back lol Well now that he has weighed in, the powers that be won’t have any choice but to change police institutions and the direction of the flow of capital. Will Switzerland act as a smuggler and banker for their new fascist overlord like they did 80 years ago? Will they seize minority assets for themselves? 

You’re being an alarmist and conspiracy theorist. The rioting and looting is largely because humans act like idiots when they get into large groups. It’s not any one group. It’s just humans in general. https://i0.wp.com/mk0webretailer1u87a1.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/International-Returns-Options.jpg?resize=350%2C200&ssl=1 Legally, it’s not over until he puts her back in her original packaging and returns her to the vendor.  

Via FedEx probably, given how much he hates the USPS. ? Becuase he is doing/saying anything to garner votes. He will get elected and go back on his word.( damn chicago politics really took a toll on me) Everything is done to benefit the rich at the top of government. I'm no better off today than I was 20 years ago.

I think people in the usa don't understand how good the average person has it in other countries. Wow, you don't understand that pro lifers will vote republican even if Satan himself is the candidate? Wow. eh? BOT Do you ever get the feeling that marriage is long over with? >Those were good times... 

... when our president wasn’t trying to kill us with clorox injections, police dominance, and by defunding and rejecting scientists’ guidance on handling a pandemic. But Biden literally wrote the bill that caused all of this. He has yet to apologize. Words are less than actions. I'm so stressed as a Democrat. I feel like I'm a prisoner to hate and trickery with Biden as the candidate.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act VOTE this TURD out!!!! Biden wrote the crime bill that fueled the precedent Reagan started....

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act Good speech Yeah, I remember when we had an adult in the Oval Office. 

Those were good times. We all are. But there are millions of us who are willing to stand up for what's right. We're not going to lay down and let Trump turn this country into a fascist dictatorship. By Trumpian standards you're right.  At the times, there were big gulfs between the candidates, usually, in my opinion.  Sr. voting for Clinton should have been the turning point in the last election, but we know how weirdly that last week went... If you look at their policies, most Republican presidents before Trump could have easily been moderate democrats. Bush Sr. actually voted for Clinton and Bush Jr. didn't vote for president. It all comes down to abortion and homosexuality for a lot of people. Most people aren't well acquainted with religious history and texts. What they do know is that it's a sin to abort or to have sex with the same gender, so if you support those things they assume you're not christian. We know what percentage Jill Stein got and across the board, it would have been enough to give Hillary the edge in all 3.  Obligatory “Don’t get complacent, vote” but the contrast between Trump and Biden -has- to be getting through to any undecideds that might be out there. Only as long as the payments come from the union/individual and not the taxpayers, good! What annoys me is that Republicans claim that Democrats aren't Christians. I can remember conversations here on Reddit about how Hillary wasn't a real Christian, that it was all an act. But Trump? Oh yeah, a man of God This was a very powerful statement, read in an authoritative manner. The choice is clear. If you still can’t make up your mind, after everything that’s happened, please just stay home on Election Day. Biden wasn’t even in my top six, but I would vote for a potato if it has a (D) after its name. That's great! Very inspiring

Also, I wasn't aware that a redditor knew most of my extended family from back home 🤔 > be a good Christian for 5 minutes.

... Checks history book on Christianity ...

Yeah, that pretty much tracks. I'm also not thrilled about Biden winning the primary, but I'm energized about voting Trump out and encouraged about Bidens recent overtures to progressives. Ok, assume you’re Trump and you want to get a photo op to pander to the religious people who for some reason or another see you as a Jesus figure. Why would THIS be the photo you thought would be good? 

A better photo would be you sitting in an empty church pew. The photo is shot from behind you with the alter in the backdrop. Your head is slightly bowed and you have the Bible open to some poignant verse.

Also, did they not think people would be filming how the secret service cleared the streets? This man is so fucking dense. I think it should be noted that the last three months aren't necessarily good for the Democratic Party's chances of taking back the White House. Often disenfranchised voters don't vote Democratic: they just don't vote. People who feel unrepresented by the system don't vote. People who feel that neither party will change things for the better don't vote. And the Democratic Party does a lot at the local level to chase police union support.

There are a lot of people who believe, "he's an idiot who's wrecking the country, so Biden's a shoe-in for 2020." But then, that's what they said about Bush vs. Kerry in 2004. By the way...I googled the boogaloo thing. I honestly had never heard of it until you mentioned it. I saw that they operate heavily in Facebook. I don’t use Facebook, so maybe that’s why I am just hearing of them. I'm really looking forward to the Republicans For Biden ads that are going to start coming out.  George W. telling people to vote Democrat is going to be almost as surreal as the Trump presidency has been. His ‘ brand ‘. When I came to understand that concept ( a brand ) , it made a little more sense. I didn't realize how *much* I missed that until I saw Biden talking this week. Love him or not, you can't deny he's being a leader, which we desperately need right now. a lot of them are all y’all no walk i believe that number would be closer to a couple thousand at most and the secret service will drag his ass out if Biden Wins I remember when Hillary couldn't lose.

I give to Joe's campaign EVERY WEEK because I know this will be a hard fight all the way to the end and maybe even after. We live in a world where hugs are a bad thing.  That's a bad thing.  I like Biden more for his hug thing (and I'm not a hugger), not less.  Some politicians kiss babies for the photo op.  I think he just likes making contact.  It's a shame that's been ruined for us as a culture. Fuck him. https://i.imgur.com/GueSIXp.png That looks stupid from every angle. Is he trying to send some <3 to his Evangelical voters? We need to keep the momentum going and Express how all of this anger should be channeled into voting. Voting in ALL city and state and county elections. Yeah thats Philly. Check out r/Philadelphia for more details Okay, buddy, you're sounding more like a troll right now. We all hate Trump, but we can't insult our country by calling it a shit hole. 46% of the country voted against Trump, and the vast majority will do it agian. One bad president doesn't give you the right to insult everyone who died for our country, Chill out In all honesty, you're being kinda crazy angry and your statments dont' make a lot of literal or grammatical sense. I won't blame people for misunderstanding. Maybe take a second to read what you're writing and put it across in a less angry mannes? Obama choosing him as his running mate/VP does say a lot.  Making a big deal of the hugging thing has always bothered me for personal reasons.  My dad is the same way, and he certainly is not trying to harass or intimidate anyone by doing so.  It’s easy for me to forgive his gaffes because he’s human.  What I can’t wrap my head around is those who think Trump is a-ok in everything he says (even when inciting violence and racism), but they zone in on every little gaffe Biden has ever made. Yes a Russian shill was voted into office. Yes he attained office through Russian interference in the election. Yes part of that strategy was state-by-state winner-take-all delegates, the irrelevance of non-swing states, and the electoral college.  But these have been around since the founding and so we can hardly blame them for where we are right now. They were just grandfathered in plumbing that were used by Russia to meddle in the election. And we need to always remember that the Russian goal is not primarily to elect Trump but instead to engender lack of faith in our civil institutions.

So I believe that both conservatives and liberals love their country.  I believe that the United States electorate are good people who want good for their country and usually make the right decisions. I believe that the Deep patriotic state that is loyal to the Constitution is present and continues to be our protection.

Lincoln said that no president can do too much damage in just four years. Today it's hard to believe he said that, but I'm  hopeful that the rule of law will hold and I think I have a good base for that hope. These are keepers. I think I’ve heard the second but the first is gold. 

I heard that if you want to see the real person, give them power. I love those Two Corinthians - such a pair! Thanks. Here's the original undoctored image:  [https://twitter.com/kiers/status/1267800832239644672](https://twitter.com/kiers/status/1267800832239644672) That McConnell ad is awesome. Some people actually believe in the "small government" paradise hoax and I guess Will still is. I mean how could you be GOP through the Reagan years and Bush II and not think "hm this is a pretty awful group." Sick and tired of police unions. Fuck 'em! Biden is nailing it! Seems Tucker is more vicious than Trump. Even fucking Rush Limbaugh has sympathy for Floyd but Tucker is ok with Police Thugs. You know how I thought this would go? At some point, the plural you would have a moment of enlightenment, and realize that certain segments of society have been getting a raw deal, and you should be doing *better*, starting *yesterday*.

What happened instead is the plural you yelled at me, "I'm going to ignore you because I don't like what you're telling me. How *dare* you offend my sensibilities?!" Compromise might be part of living in society, and all that, but you've all made it pretty clear that *you're* not the ones that are supposed to be compromising, because... reasons, I guess? Okay, then.

I'm disappointed, but not even remotely surprised. This is why we can't have nice things. It's all about the Benjamins! Glad someone else confirmed my assumptions. I've reported the top comment as misinformation. A grammar fascist who puts like four spaces after a sentence. I hear that. One of my sons also called it a dystopia. Biden is a light in the darkness. Im not sure what crowds you're watching,  bit from my perspective the rioting and looting wad actually WORSE last night,  with some of it staring hours even before the curfew went into effect.  This movement isn't going anywhere.  It has just started. That's YUGE in my book. Yeah, Biden sometimes shoots from the hip in a way that gets exploded into a bigger issue than it really is, including his hugs etc.   I kinda feel for him, I'm prone to honest gaffes myself... no filter... I expect our leaders to be better than me, otherwise what's the point, but it's easy to see where Biden's heart is at, and frankly, Obama's endorsement by choosing him as VP filled in the blanks for me.  He's a great choice for taking down Trump, right here right now.  Sometimes you need a Chamberlain and sometimes you need a Churchill.  No, I'm not comparing him to Churchill, but I searched for an analogy and came up with that semi-accurate gaffe on the fly. Uplifting. This is how a leader talks. Someone needs to adapt this song - [Heywood Banks' Pretending I'm Not Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCY7NSqjnmM) to the topic at hand.  Pile on the mockery - he deserves it. Very true.  While Biden was not my first choice, I believe he is the right choice.  The problem with Biden is him not thinking before speaking sometimes, and he makes too many gaffes to not do that.  I truly don’t think he means anything by them, but they can be used against him so easily.  So yes, I think he needs to lay low and let Trump keep making an ass out of himself. You should probably get a stool with how much you're reaching. Lol so you clearly have no idea the boogaloo is for. One it’s not a civil war it would be a revolutionary war if it came to it. Two, it literally has nothing to do with race anyone who is pro gun and wants to limit gov power is accepted no matter race. Three, majority are not republicans nor do they support trump, most are libertarians and believe in limiting government power and more power with the people, less taxes, less ridiculous laws (war on drugs for one). You most certainly are *not* behaving like a *friend*, and most definitely *not* "treating me with respect and kindness". You are also deliberately and purposefully misunderstanding (and misapplying) everything I'm saying - if this is you being *friendly*, I would say the situation is pretty fucked, no? Every conversion counts! From the beginning, this has been about the status for Trump. I dream of retiring there. >DOD put out a statement today

I think I have my finger on the pulse of news and then I somehow miss something breathtakingly significant.

The most recent public statement from the DOD I can find was five days ago regarding COVID-19. Defense.gov says nothing new. A search of the usual news sources yields nothing like that.

What exactly did the DOD say and to whom? I feel those same people do the same with Nancy Pelosi.  Strong, intelligent, competent, and powerful women are still looked down upon.  And if they are of color, it’s even worse. Typical Trump behavior Bible predicted corona confirmed, someone get History Channel on the phone! Hahahaaaaa orangefuckface what a cock. That's fair, especially because I am actually liking him more and more each day. I can do that from now on. Exactly what I was thinking! The primary difference in the two candidates, imo, is that Biden is not tone-deaf to what the nation needs and will take criticism as a form of how we can improve, not as what he as an individual is doing wrong.

The fact that he has been willing to apologize for things he's said and done is refreshing after 3.5 years of finger pointing and name calling. This is what REAL leadership looks like Thanks!!! Pfft and people get called radical for plotting to assassinate Trump the longer the people wait to start shooting police who won't kneel or stand in solidarity, the easier it will be for Trump to take control One of the sayings I was raised with is "Once you are more interested in power than principle, you're done.  You are of no use to the people whose lives are affected by you.".

Another phrase my mother preached that falls in line with that is: "Most of the time, the right decision is the difficult decision.". https://twitter.com/threeheadedtoad/status/1267682742298238978?s=21 King Joffrey done Lol Republicans still claiming lincoln As any dictator would be 😆 Yea, that was literally when trump was being elected. I’m sure it was deadly for all lgbt people, potentially even disproportionately to trans people. It WAS better in 2015. You can’t deny that. At a minimum, it was better than it is now. 

You just want to argue. And I’m so fucking annoyed. I don’t dislike you because you’re trans, I don’t like you because you don’t want help, you won’t contribute positively to a discussion and you’re not willing to help yourself. If you wanna make enemies with everyone, fine. But don’t expect others to treat you nicely if you won’t do the same to them. I haven’t hurt you. I’m trying to help you and your cause, but I won’t contribute to partake in your pitty part. Grow up and be an adult. I voted for her on 2016 and I will vote for Biden this year, I’m from NJ so a safe state but still have to vote, do we know what percentage of Bernie supporters from those states you mentioned voted for Hillary on 2016? This is my thought. The Secret Service isn’t really interested in the politics. They likely got the order that the President was moving and did the thing. The rest of the Administration seemed confused and the DOD put out a statement today walking back everything Trump said about the military. Of course you don't owe me anything, it's called doing favors for your fellow Democrats who are trying to learn more about a Candidate. Fuck. Yeah apparently I indeed suck at google because literally I've been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to find Biden quote from today and coming up with ziltch. Trump: "Principle? Is that the guy I pass to pick up my date at middle school?" It is photoshopped.  The Hitler pic doesn’t include a book at all. Most Bernie supporters will vote for Biden. The ones who make demands and threats we can win without.

You lost. Move on for the good of the country and the rest of the world. Tucker didn't criticize Trump and Kushner because he sympathizes with protestors. He criticized them for NOT being tough enough. Maybe try steering her towards the history of what dems have accomplished vs. republicans? I don't actually owe you anything. If you don't know how to use Google that's hardly my problem but uh you're welcome I guess > Nor is it acceptable for our police — sworn to protect and serve all people — to escalate tensions or resort to excessive violence.

VERY VERY rare for politicians to actually call out POLICE as the ones to blame.

The usual words are "racism is bad." No shit. That's like saying you're against cancer.

Cops get to agree with "racism bad."

What about police brutality?

Cops: "What police brutality?"

I'm not  a Dem or Repub. I'm Canadian.

But I want to recruit you people here to spread the message: "Push POLICE hard, hard, hard to admit police brutality (and abuse of authority) is the primary problem.

* Police Brutality
* Racism

linked, but different. Cops can talk about racism. They have to admit they are the source of the problem with police brutality.

With police brutality, they are the bad guy.

Make sure all the speeches to come are viewed thru this filter. Don't let these wretched bastards off, because they are slimey and will grin fuck you to avoid change. I'm asking in good faith and you can't even provide anything? I finally managed to tune into him making a speech today after a fellow redditor that actually gave a shit did send me a link, thanks for nothing. Facebook is a monopolistic company that should be broken up using the power of US antitrust laws. It's not that complicated. You went 15 different ways - be more concise if you want to not be misconstrued.  You think that excitement shouldn't come from candidates, that it shouldnt be a reality show. BUT people should be happy and excited (wait what how did we get to people should be excited?) Bernie is great, but "you gotta make your expectations more reasonable." Yay get trump out of office, insert a random comparison to nazis, and then you end with a conclusion not backed up by ANY of your previous points.

Also, please explain further what you meant by your first sentence that can not be reasonably summarized to what I paraphrased it as. I support much of his policies but Biden isn't showing himself as a great leader during this time. Public opinion is on the protestors side and it is extremely easy for him to support it. Say what you may, I just think it's just another day as a politician for Biden. It probably looked better on the whiteboard than the actual execution.

Bet they didn't even give a single thought to the optics of clearing the path, they were just timing it for the daylight. Since we seem to best respond to simplistic jingoism as a species:  Fuck Facebook.  I hope his coders make something new and better, and it goes the way of MySpace. Ive seen the picture too but I also saw the same image without the book. It definitely appears Photoshopped. Really, it's not like we need Photoshop to make valid comparisons to Hitler for Trump. Do you get the feeling a lot of conservatives just want to be on the winning team?  I respect Will, and I'm glad to see some Republicans coming to their senses, but I hope the Democrats just say "No thanks, we got this" and let them stew in the rubble of their own party, since they made the mess in the first place.   Except for George W.'s endorsement, of course, and maybe Fucker Carlson's, because super-lol. Surprised it didn't burn his hand. It became *de riguer* to "not like Hillary" but acceptable to not list specific reasons.

One of the most widely admired women alive, and possibly the single most qualified candidate for President since George Washington, and people didn't think anything about saying "I just don't like her" without having reasons.

Nobody liked her but she drew more votes than anyone ever except Obama (another candidate that "nobody liked"). no "Karl Marx enters the chat" Since it's become fashionable to "not like Biden" without actually giving reasons, I've started asking for reasons.

What policies do you object to? Obviously the argument isn't about qualifications, since Biden tops the shortest lists of the most qualified people to ever run for public office. How do we get this post stickied? "nOBody Is tRyInG tO tAkE yoUr GuNS."

Yeah sure, funny tho that you guys scream police brutality 24/7 (wich is legit, I mean look around) but want people to be beaten up an lynched whitout having the abillity to protect themselfes. Now if we could get the other non-racist Trump supporters to realize he's a bigot and get non-voters to realize another 4 years of Trump would negatively affect them personally, then we might win this thing... I think a lot of bermie fans are waking up. Thank God. I think what people are trying to say is that it is more helpful to say “I’m voting to get Donald Trump out”, not “I don’t like Biden, but he’s not as bad!”

A lot of us that do prefer Biden are worried that the conversation will turn to “the lesser of two evils” like in 2016. That conversation could lead to the notion that somehow Biden (imperfect, absolutely), belongs in the same conversation about incompetence as Trump. 

You’re entitled to prefer another candidate, and voice that however you feel, but let’s make this about getting corruption out. I’ll admit, Biden is a Band-Aid, but just because the Band-Aid isn’t the brand you prefer, it’s either that or bleed out. Bruh are you fucking high? This aint a tv wonderland dude, countries have gone to war for less. People coming from other countries were not being screened at the airports. Show me a public cry. I literally can't find one. Hey, thanks for trying. So sad. Biden being presidential. I have missed that these past three years Only takes one being unruly and the tear gas is coming out Yesterday really upset me. I’m a bit older and, to me, these were children that were protesting. Then Trump literally orders an attack on the children, the future, of this country. Like a bully, he paraded, with a combat dressed general yet, to a church and held up a Bible. This stunt is literally spitting in the face of our spirituality.

Biden’s speech warmed me and gave me a glimpse of light in this darkness.

I’ve been through the assassination of JFK. Civil rights, the Vietnam War. Yesterday’s evil actions by Trump is probably at the bottom of the dark pit of dystopia. Wise words, friend. I'll check out those links. Thank you! I love psychology In the same speech we’re talking about in this article he also recommended officers train to shoot unarmed knife attackers in the leg instead of the torso. It is absolutely the candidate’s job to excite their base. That being said, Biden is clearly better than Trump. 

I’ve been out protesting a lot this last week and the sentiment is not “I can’t wait for Biden” it is more about solidarity with each other in the face of our elites not doing enough. Now is the time to do more.

Also, vote for Biden please!!! We will do all we can to push him where he needs to get. His administration and cabinet will be world’s better than we have currently. Trump is a fucking moron.  Nothing he does makes sense to normal people. In his mind, it looks "powerful." Plus, his numbers have slipped almost 10 points in support by evangelicals, so he thinks this will help him with that. We haven't lost the right. It is ours. What we've lost is the false sense of security that comes from taking freedoms for granted. Trump is an authoritarian, as are the Republicans who made sure he can do as he wishes. They are the enemies of democratic governance. These racist elitists detest the idea that ordinary people, including people of color and immigrants, can direct the course of government and policy. They must be defeated at the box office, conclusively and without question. Otherwise this 250 year old experiment is finished. I 100% agree we should vote for Biden, but I 100% disagree with the statement saying he is proving himself to be a great leader. I think he is simply a better option than Trump, and his team will be far better than Trump's team. But I think he is a weak candidate. That and the WH being pitch black, is a symbol of this presidency so far. Trump thinks principles are the people your dad bribes to let you pass.  If you ever get a chance look up the term 'Lazy Think.'  But long story short is your brain is lazy and uses shortcuts to save on processing power.  Which makes sense your out in the forest hunting wildebeests and need to conserve calories.

Here is an article, talking about how it works and gives you sentences to show how you can lazy think (Funny story is the first line is about fake news): [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thoughts-thinking/201902/4-outcomes-lazy-thinking](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thoughts-thinking/201902/4-outcomes-lazy-thinking)

With that said!   The most important thing I can share with you is my own rationalist motto: **“What do you think you know, and how do you think you know it?"**

If you burn that into your brain you will realize how much stuff you just assume is true. That’s a really poor interpretation of my point. I don't know about you? 


But I believe the police were the one with tear gas. 


The people were just protesting peacefully. No damage to property or anything like that, at least in my area. I’ve seen the image on Reddit, but I’m not sure it’s real. The book Hitler was holding looked exactly like the one Trump had, right down to the embossing on the front cover. I also can’t find any images of Hitler holding a book in his right hand in a few minutes of googling. She says she is unsure, she wants to do more research on 3rd party candidates before she makes a decision Fixed! Thank you! white supremacist plant  ruined the madison wi protests  because  they got a white chick to do some performance in front of the cops   then  she started smashing the windows of all the small businesses.
cops fucking suck at deescalating..
  when we peacefully marched none of them joined or respected the movement.. they stared at us like serial killers.  I stood in a line making  a white wall to protect the black ppl  when we went past the court house  that had a line of the fuzz staring us down. Coronians Apparently, President Bone Spurs needed TP It’d be great if she cast her ballot for Biden, but if she voted for Trump in 2016 and skips voting this year, it’ll still be a hit against him. proud boys are the worst the white supremacists are inciting the most and hitting the worst targets... .   you think that antifa lit fire to that childrens hospital?  no fucking way   at worst hitting banks and confederate monuments..  police stations  court houses etc...        antifa i think has good intentions  but is it helping to have them on the streets right now?  I guess i don't know. maybe they will do more good recording police than fighting them. also  identifying and snagging white supremacist agitators when they are caught in the act.   we need the military on our side.. trump will attempt a coup if thinks it is possible to lose the election.

the sdny said they would prosecute him once  he is out of office.  if you could lose your kingship to go to prison  wouldn't you go kicking and screaming?   unless you think trump is thinking about responsibility and not self serving.    I just don't understand why people say "he is a bad president"    .... he isn't your president...  he was never trying to help you   so he isn't "bad"  at it.  he has done a great job doing what he actually wanted.. filling judges, military, supreme court etc.. positions  and studying the ways of dictators around the world.  if people don't see it now then they won't see it once they are stuck in a chain gang or gassed in the showers.... Yes, it was good that he shut down the flights, but that's all he did 40,000 more people came in without being screened. He never follows up. He just throws shit into the wind and Hope's it sticks. When it doesn't, its everyone else's fault. Jeez, what took so long??? They were in the park ministering to the peaceful protesters, and were gassed with everyone else so Trump could pretend to be a good Christian for 5 minutes. He gassed peaceful Americans, pushed aside reporters, and forced the priests away to use the church.  The church was never consulted and did not give its permission.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/police-force-out-protesters-minutes-before-trump-can-pose-for-photos/2020/06/01/2f950018-3781-4d91-8af2-db893c4503d1\_video.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/police-force-out-protesters-minutes-before-trump-can-pose-for-photos/2020/06/01/2f950018-3781-4d91-8af2-db893c4503d1_video.html) Absolutely repulsive. Someone please, link? Fighting in vain.    Grammar facist here. But he's read 1st and 2nd Corellians! Damn that's a good way of putting it. A programming exploit. Think like a robot, get used like a robot "Please just doublethink yourself into being a happy camper for Biden"

I'm good, thanks. He can change his policy to be more aligned with my interests if he wants me to be happy with him. That's something that he has control over, since we're talking about having control over things. His idiot base doesn’t give a fuck except that he pretends to be Christian. That bible is upside down and backwards He tear gassed the clergy at that church, too. 

It’s like shitting on the table and demand everyone praise you because you’re sitting like a big boy on your chair at said shit table. He doesn't know the difference. well said! There is extreme irony in the church he chose for his photo. The Episcopal church is way more liberal than the evangelical base he relies on. and wtf was his and Melania's little trip to st. pauls just now??? another photo op, totally! Oh, I see what you're saying now.  And you're right, but it isn't a new story.  Appealing to emotion goes all the way back to the death of Socrates.

&#x200B;

Hell, it's even one of the common techniques you learn in highschool to make a persuasive argument:  ethos, logos and **pathos**.

&#x200B;

Edit:  With that said, you're right.  It isn't a good thing.  Personally I think it's more of a programing exploit in our code. Wtf? You go on this heart felt explanation of your feelings and end it with “antifa or the“boogaloo” movement?

What is the “boogaloo” movement? What makes you think antifa is behind anything?

Furthermore, are you going to point that same finger towards the three percenters? The Proud Boys? Or any of the myriad of right wing, anti government, white nationalist militia groups?

They are the ones constantly threatening Civil War. Has he never held a book before? Do you know if she is going to vote for Biden, or not vote at all? The entire history of Christianity basically happened because emperor Constantine needed an army to retake parts of the Roman empire. If you had not done this Christianity would not be what it is today it's possible it would be extinct. So, he didn’t think there was enough to mock him about before?? 

Thanks for the ammo you bunker dwelling keyboard warrior? Grow out your neck beard already! Amen He stands with peaceful protesters, till he needs a photo op! The election is about kicking Trump out. That said, Biden is changing his tune and sounding more progressive all the time, which is encouraging. 100% agreed. 

Check out the rabbit hole of [searching twitter for "peaceful until the police"](https://twitter.com/search?q=peaceful%20until%20the%20police&src=typed_query) for tons of proof I had forgotten what leadership looks like. 

> A nation where not only we are created equal, but also treated equal! Those words will go down in history. Oh, that's what I mean. People have become very aware when someone is using a strawman fallacy (though they haven't figured out just calling out a fallacy isn't the same as winning a debate yet), but seem mostly oblivious when arguments, especially in the media, are appeals to their emotions Ive been through a handful of riots in different contexts.  In my experience the riot tends to start when the police do, it is basic human nature. He looks sooooo uncomfortable and awkward holding a Bible haha Surely son! Just lay back on your high horse, and tell me all your biases, delusions, and fears! I don't follow the last part.  Appeal to emotion and Traymen are both fallacies. 1. Bernie
2. Yang
3. Warren
4. Biden

No, not my preferred candidate. Too bad not enough people acted like adults 3 1/2 years ago. So much of this could have all been avoided. They always use soft gloves. Donald has zero interest in principle. Wow I didn't even realize there were a bunch of primaries today.  After Bernie dropped out and we got hit by a motherfucking plague I admit I haven't paid as much attention. So it sounds like he's your preferred candidate Amazing how effective propaganda can be.

I've started evaluating news stations by how they're trying to make the audience feel. If a news station is inclined to incite fear, anger, hatred, and violence, it's amazing how it hooks people in. Can't tell you how many online debates I've seen where people cry "Strawman!" "Fallacy!" and yet have never heard of "appeal to emotion." Wait...so his brilliant idea was to tear-gas peaceful protesters so that he could puff his chest out holding a Bible because he was stung by criticism that he was hiding in a bunker. 

Article 25 time. Again. I don't mean to be that guy, but if we had stronger support for Hillary in 2016 from the Bernie-or-Bust crowd, at least in MI, WI and PA, we wouldn't be in this position. Where have the Democrats been during all of this?????????? Hope is how we continue to take those two steps forward while being forced one step back. Too late to change teams, Fucker.  We won't forgive your evil. Fascist so cowardly and insecure about their opinions that they pretend to be anti-fascists. I feel so (cautiously) hopeful! Who in the world who treasures the Bible would hold it like *that* with such dead eyes?

It's like a weird version of holding your right hand in the air while placing your left hand on the Bible done by someone who has never done this before. Except he has done this before. Lights are on, but no one is home. You need to understand man.

Facemasks = Oppression

Press being arrested = Owning the Libs Why do some Republicans arm themselves if not for abusing the power of the military? There is an obvious difference between a protest having white people there showing support and white provocateurs either bad faith white supremacists or white people trying to make this about something else/them and trying to instigate violence and destruction of property.

&#x200B;

White people should be showing solidarity, they shouldn't be trying to co-opt the movement for their own goal of trying to provoke a more violent/destructive response for a race war (white supremacist) or revolution (anarchist/leftist violent revolutionaries).  

&#x200B;

There are countless videos of protestors having to restrain overzealous white people bent on making the whole protest look bad (or who are delusional and think they are helping like several social media types we have seen trying to get people to flip semi trucks, spray paint a starbucks, or break sidewalks to throw at the police).  


That some of them are white supremacists is the ultimate betrayal,  white people should be more respectful of what this is all about.  Their support is great and needed, but this is not about them and their alternate agendas this is about racial justice.  Reddit/twitter is full of delusional white people trying to take over the cause for their own purposes and at the protests (at least here) there are definitely a very very very small minority of white people doing this on the street. He’s not a political opponent he’s an enemy of the state. After seeing him tear gassing peaceful protesters yesterday there is no doubt in my mind he is actively trying to hurt the nation and make things worse for everyone, including his base. Praying on street corners for all to see...I think the Bible has some thoughts on those who do that. Y’all should really reel in your vocal surrogates then (Brie brie, Sirota, Robinson, Ball, etc.) because they make you all look horrible. You don’t/didn’t have prominent Biden surrogates out there bashing Bernie over the most ridiculous shit. We also don’t have subs like OurPresident or WOTB who post nothing but Biden smears 24/7. The only sub similar to that for us would be ESS, and that sub is a pure and inverse reaction to the vocal online Sanders community. It reacts almost exclusively to comments made by these vocal bernie bros. That study also only analyzed Twitter. I’m speaking from Reddit experience, as Twitters just toxic shit with no productive discourse He’s as simple as his followers.  Problem is that nobody smart is falling for it. I'm not exactly sure why he got rid of that task force, but wasn't he the one taking precautions by closing down flights from China in January? Everyone said it was an act of racism but he was the one doing it from the beginning, no ? That's awesome, heartening. What a thin-skinned weakling. Nah I don't buy it. Trump may be terrible, but he is soooooo good at being Trump. The man can barely string a sentence together, but he really is a good media man. I don't think anyone can willingly emulate him. Same here!  He was my second choice (after Warren) from day one. >"They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations." Wasn’t even a good photo op. Looked kinda like he’d never seen a book before. It’s a Harvard study. Google it. For the most part, they won't, but there will be those that stand to gain from this and those that are blind followers of the faith, there will be some showing support for this its on us to scold them or just straight up ignore, don't try to save the ones who still stand by trump after this they're a lost cause. 

I was watching Fox News last night flipping from there to CNN, CNN almost called this out immediately for what it was and Anderson Cooper was in shock as to how abhorrent this act was, Fox News was covering the "Historic Church" and how awful it was that "Government property is being destroyed" and Martha macullum or whatever was just "so sad that history is being erased". Keep in mind this was a small fire and the church will likely be repaired in no time. Damn! That was about as presidential as it gets. I’ve literally seen people on Bernie subs say it with my own eyes. 

There it is. Claiming that your candidate, who said “aren’t most drug dealers black”, chose not to march in Selma with the other candidates, and tried to primary the first black president, is the only god sent one, as you continue to call Biden racist, despite failing to acknowledge he was selected by the vast majority of the black community. It was Biden supporters that fabricated and pushed the "low-info voter" line.

  
Biden has a verifiable history of racist comments and inappropriate actions around women and children. Now diagnose me, doctor! Don't forget [The Trump Prophecy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Prophecy) and [QAnon](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/)
 and [The Power Worshipers](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-power-worshippers-9781635573459/) as well as C-Street, The Family, and in general, those that fervently believe in The Rapture like Pompeo an Pence. The broad umbrella is Christian Nationalism which is comprised of neo-Confederate groups, Ku Klux Klan groups, racist skinheads and other sharing white supremacist beliefs. (See https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/27/gods-vengeance-the-christian-right-and-the-coronavirus/) I’m gonna vote for Biden, but I really wish I didn’t have to. I really wish we didn’t keep putting ourselves in these lesser of two evils situations. It sucks, but right now a vote for Biden on November 3rd is the right thing to do. I'd spit on Trump in a heartbeat. [Yes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/delegate-count-primary-results.html). If you guys don't vote this November, you may not have the option 4 years from now Thank you! Thanks for writing this, because I personally struggle with this.  I have had many decent Republicans in my life as friends and family and I think Democrats let themselves off easy on the difficulty of a lot of policy questions when they don't take the other side's point of view seriously.  But with Trump, it's so hard to see any of his enthusiastic followers as anything more than people who are enthusiastic for...evil.  He's such a personification of every human sin, everything that tears us apart, of the human tendency toward fascism.  The simple explanation for people who cheer this man is that they see exactly how vile he is, and they love it. https://i.redd.it/iv1l7i9eli251.png At this point, the less Biden campaigns the better.  That's not a slam at Biden, just a recognition of how things work.  Trump's doing his campaigning for him. I would argue that Biden isn’t a bitter pill, and that’s just your outlook, which you do have control over.  

I don’t think it should be a candidate’s job to get people excited.  Look at Canada.  The least exciting candidates, the reasonable, thoughtful, perhaps even quiet people, are often the best leaders. But people don’t vote for excitement. This isn’t the bachelor. 

Let’s stop expecting the election to look like a reality show, and be happy and excited to have reasonable people in office. 

I get it Bernie is an incredible man. I wish he was president.  But we can’t hold our leaders up to that level and be bitter if they’re not.  He’s a once in a lifetime candidate, and there are elections every four years.  You gotta make your expectations more reasonable.  I’m also really sad we missed out on Bernie. But Bernies excellence doesn’t diminish Biden as a good candidate. It’s a missed opportunity, but now we move on. 

And not to mention that we should be as ecstatic to get Trump out of office as much as the soldiers were when they heard WWII ended.  None of those soldiers thought, gee, I’m really sad about who they got to replace Hitler. 

We need focus, our country is literally tearing itself apart, and we need to close the gaping wound.  The brand of gauze at this point is to me a trivial sticking point. You people are certainly something. Also calling me a fake insult doesn’t hurt my feelings like the real one seems to hurt you folk The differences could not be more clear. Straight from the Biden Bro’s mouth. A very good speech by Joe Biden. As I say in a lot of my posts: PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ ONLINE!! I am a Biden supporter and I've never heard of Biden Bros I have heard of The Bernie Bros and I ask all of you/them and all of my liberal friends to please come and help us defeat the demonic entity in the White House. We need all Democrats weather liberal or moderate we need all disenfranchised Republicans and all independents to come together to get this thing done and to get IT out of the White House. Just by seeing how this demonic entity is handling the coronavirus and the killing of George Floyd by gassing Americans and peaceful protesters just for a fucking photo up should be enough to get US ALL together and say enough is enough it is time for IT to go!! I'm not providing a solution, just telling you to stop being rude and ignorant.

I 100 percent acknowledge your point, but if you think that every single Bernie supporter is going to support Biden then you're unbelievably naive. And now you're beating a dead horse by reviving fake and false monikers for fringe supporters who you couldn't count on anyway?? I will never understand this obsession with the term No, Biden is the worst candidate that we could have run. But he’s got we got now so it is him or Trump. 

Trump won in 2016 by running to the left of Hillary Clinton. Watch trump do the same thing to Biden in 2020. No one was gonna run to the left of Bernie Sanders. Any sane Bernie bros will show up and gladly vote for Biden or just blue down the line. Exactly. Let’s not pretend that Biden is somehow wonderful. He’s not. He is the lesser of two evils. But he is a lesser evil. Great leader? Yeah okay. Could I please see that “empirical” review? Could be interesting to read Oh don't worry, the fascists will still stage sham elections for quite some time. St John's Church no less

It's one of the most important churches for presidents and their history. It wasn't a random church that he picked out. It's where Lincoln used to pray a lot during the Civil War.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_Episcopal_Church,_Lafayette_Square An empirical review of online responses and comments revealed that Bernie supporters are actually more mellow and soft-spoken than those of other candidates. Next. Oh, okay then ehat is his handling of it? I haven't seen anything about it. Wait why are saying that black voters and people of the Latino community can't be bro's? Anyone can be a bro white or black ans bro-terminology despite its origanal conception of male can be used liberly to describe any gender. Anyone making even the slightest effort should be seeing these crowds and riots have a whole lot of white people in them, this is clearly not just a black thing...

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=znMCGKdaV2I&t=206s See what I mean. You've been convinced you have no choice. The country will be taken over by conservatives if you don't vote for Joe. This is the same idea Trump and the republicans are selling but about democrats. You do have a choice. You always have. Well done. I think the one thing Joe Biden has more than any candidate in recent memory is empathy and compassion. It’s very refreshing right now Took a break from work and listened for a few minutes. What a breath of fresh air to hear a sane politician speak rationality and compassionately. As a retired union firefighter, I'm extremely annoyed that half or more of my colleagues voted for tRump.. most Cops are Con Party voters.. heck, a lot of most union's members vote for those who are trying to destroy their union.. If only Biden could form a competent sentence... I hope 5 months from now people do not forget the mess we have right now in the WH You should post this in r/politics and the other Bernie subs Well, he’s not wrong. By referring to supporters of Bernie's campaign as 'Bros' you are erasing the views of his female supporters and dismissing his popular support among latino and young black voters. Brother. What would make you think I watch any of that shit. Or commercial TV? I’ve been a registered Democrat for 30 years. 2016 would maybe tell you not to get cocky and consider. Strategy that can win elections. Right now, that means behaving as a president-in-waiting and providing the visibility of leadership. Simply voting blue and imagining everything the people are fighting for will happen is worse than Trump. Kick out all the neoliberals. End corporate influence on the government. Just voting blue won't do. Biden wasn’t my first choice, but he’s what we’ve got, and we absolutely CANNOT have the orange idiot for another four years. And maybe Biden will be better than I think he will, I’d love him to prove me wrong and be awesome instead of just OK. It’s crazy because I don’t know a single one of those millions. Lol. I don't *owe* you shit, I treat you with respect and kindness, you do the same to me. That's equality and that is my role to play. Accelerationism on your terms only just creates a counterveiling wave of hatred.

Integration takes time and effort, requires recognition and open discussion. By closing off the discussion and saying that I am your enemy simply because I am not like you ONLY hurts your own cause. So reading the comments, I get there is still a lot of divide between Biden and Bernie supporters and my opinion on who should be running I’ll keep to myself for this post. But my fellow Americans we are stuck in a time of multiple crisis with leaders who... well there are just so many things one can say about the incompetence of those running our country straight into the ground. 
Here is the thing, Biden has the Democratic nominee (like it or not) and Cheetos King has the republican nominee, as much as we need a third party, this election, voting third party is literally going to keep that blight on humanity in office. 
So there are your choices...Pretty darn simple at this point. JS Worst part is no centrist democrat is likely to change any of the systemic problems that lead to Trump. Remember that it was under Obama that the American right wing transformed from the crazy aunt you could forgive into a rage of uncontrolled mass delusion. Social media is going nowhere. And Biden, who will obviously be a vast improvement, will ignore their cries for help. Demented Hillary and Alzheimer Joe are actually what Trump supporters have been saying. 

Further, Biden was among my last choices. I haven’t even had my primary yet but I don’t have a choice, I need to vote D down the line to save the country. Please stop projecting onto me while you spread propaganda. You are literally ignoring uncomfortable truths. This is why you are the same as conservatives supporting Trump. Nothing he can do will turn you away from him because you have been convinced that the alternative is our downfall. This is literally the same thing Trump has done with his followers. How can you not see that? Last night was scary and the whole thing with the church was downright sacrilegious. I'm not the most religious person out there but even that moment touched me in a scary way that was hard to describe. We are in scary days indeed https://magpiebrule.ca/2020/06/02/through-the-red-white-blue-looking-glass/ I would never assume they all are, I also call women bernie bros. I think of it as someone who is Bernie or bust and thinks trump is equal to Biden. We’re not talking about all of his supporters, and it’s not a slur. That’s absolute nonsense. That’s like people who say karen is a slur. People were mocking him for being hidden in the bunker. This was to show how strong he is, by showing that eh could walk across the white house whenever he wanted to. I mean this is the same guy who said this about the Tiananmen square massacre:

>"When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength," Trump replied. "That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak...as being spit on by the rest of the world." 1. He should not have disbanded the pandemic response team that Obama created.

2. He should have listened to the experts and intelligence reports instead of Fox News. 

3. He should not have claimed the virus was a hoax. Also still working towards M4A and GND I’ll keep saying this: That powdery orange tough guy pout under the poof of gossamer hair nest, the shoe lift induced belly-forward lean with arm dangling, the soft baby hand gripping and unfamiliar object like a respirator at an unboxing. What an aborted adult; a  doomed lonely stupid scrotal sack stuffed with lying, sentient cockroaches squirming in pus and pre-cum and who happens to be the godlike hero to the broken-inside 42% of this shallow, bullshit country. Bernie bro is a slur. Please stop assuming everyone who supported him was a male or one of those college 'bro' types. So to you everyone who supported Bernie but not Biden is a "Bernie bro"?

Bernie Supporters are a broad coalition of people from both sides of the aisle, all ages, creeds, races etc. You're extremely presumptuous if you think a republican who supports Bernie's agenda is going to vote for a status quo, uninspiring, do-nothing democrat...

He's very lucky to get 80 percent (by your statistic). You need a reality check Those with primaries today please vote for Bernie!!!! He still can influence the democratic platform the more delegates he gets. And psssst...Biden hasn't gotten enough delegates to clinch the nomination yet. Just sayin'. Great, take that and win with it without Bernie supporters then. If you can't, then maybe listen to what they have to say in terms of how to get their vote. Beyond that, if you want them to get excited, ask them how that can be achieved.

  
You're asking the people swallowing the bitter pill to look out to the people and smile after. The LEAST you can do is not be a dick about doing so, and be understanding if the smile part isn't going to happen. He probably imagines that his "Christian" base will like it. Not sure they will, though. Why do you sound like a forwarded message from my Grandpa about Biden rather than Trump? 

Grandpa? Vote blue. Get Trump out of the White House. It is imperative. You are literally pushing propaganda. I have That’s crazy cause that’s where the Democratic Party is heading Never getting elected again your party is the slimiest most corrupt party and you have reddit Twitter and about 10 news stations all pumping out propaganda right before an election I really hope people see through this bullshit You should do some research on Biden’s crime bill and how it was eviscerated in the contract on America before posting. The same 20% who said they don’t plan to vote for Biden... They all pushed a smear against Biden for months until it utterly fell apart at their feet. Stop pretending these toxic people don’t make the largest impression on the internet. Twenty percent? Don't make me laugh. Maybe whining about fake shit that's in the past that makes Bernie supporter allies mad isn't good for your candidate?? Just voted for Bernie in the Primary today, next up is Biden in the general. No, I think you just decided not to read the comment... I didn’t edit anything. 

Stop pearl clutching. Bernie bro’s represent the worst of Bernie’s supporters. Not all of them. It’s always been the fringe 20% or so of his supporters base. People who worked for Bernie still actively rally against Biden all over Twitter. To pretend it’s not a thing is destructive. I sincerely hope Biden does something to raise enthusiasm himself. I’m a strong bernie supporter and I have serious reservations about Biden but I also feel there’s no choice. I will vote for him without hesitation and will encourage everyone I know to do the same. We can talk about the future of democrats and the left later.

The first thing we must do is GET RID OF TRUMP. And was then denounced by the leader of that cathedral So your solution is to come into a thread where the talk is of unity and to provide divisive talk? I’m sorry but Bernie Bro’s are actually a thing. Look at Briahna Joy Gray as an example. There are many people in this country that that don’t want to vote for Biden because he isn’t Bernie. To say that isn’t the case is disingenuous. Updating your comment to be more divisive and critical, eh?

Literally have no idea what you're talking about. The media and uninformed people are pushing this narrative that the most fringe and radical supporters of a candidate represent their main base, and that is frankly irresponsible, disrespectful and not helping Biden win the election. Matt Gaetz is a congressman not a senator but otherwise looks good! Fuck you he won't do what you tell him.

Get it.

No one wants to play your games  NewYorkJewbag.  Go watch Tomi Lorwhoeverthefuck you take orders from on Fox. I have no reason to vote for Biden except to stop Trump. And I’m going to do just that. Happily. I wasn't stating a fact. It's just my opinion. I'm glad you found some humor in it. I'm pretty sure it was because of Xi Jinping mocking him for being a bunker bitch. Hasn't he been hiding away due to the sexual assault allegations? I really would of rather had any of the other democrat nominees than Biden. Antithetical to Jesus. There is a word for that... I still don’t understand why this photo-op is helpful to him. What is the message he was going for?

(See https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/03/27/gods-vengeance-the-christian-right-and-the-coronavirus/) *none exist FTFY No. One exists, one doesn’t. We never threatened not to vote for the nominee. We never constantly berate members of the democratic party and other candidates. We don’t take advantages of crises to try to push our agenda. We are not the same. Now you know how we feel Let’s not lift Biden up to be a new standard. And let’s not pretend he’s something he’s not. He helped start this shit with the crime bill in 1994. I’m going to vote for Biden but don’t ask me to be happy about it What a sad pathetic excuse of a human being Stop trying to make Biden Bro’s a thing... It's not that he used the bible as a prop. It's that he used armed military police to attack and disperse a totally peaceful protest, just so he could show his religious ignorance by standing in front of a boarded up church and hold up a bible upside down.  Think about what he did yesterday;  he ordered the US military to attack a peaceful protest, while claiming to be on the side of peaceful protestors.  If he can use our own military to police us, this is truly no longer a democracy.  So, very much so NOT a non story. Blue no matter who rings true! This is not the election too stray and vote 3rd party or not vote at all! Trump has got to go! THANK YOU! If we don't take this shit seriously, we may not have a 2024 election. Bernie supporter here, we have to get rid of the megalomaniac and if voting for Joe will save America I'm all in. Still think we need to move to the left to cure the inequalities of our nation. The status quo won't do that! Yeah Bernie bro here, I love the guy and don't particularly love biden but that's my opinion. I've come to realize it would do more harm to not vote. Voting for biden has become a moral responsibility and I'm sure he can bring things back from the dumpster fire we are leaving him in November You just know, if you look in his prop bible, he crossed out Jesus’ name and replaced it with Trump, because no foreigner is gonna “out class” him! 

Fuck Trump! He doesn’t need to grasp people by the pussy anymore, he is the pussy. He’s in the same pose as Hitler used. I think Hitler’s book was Mein Kampf. But it must be a racist dog whistle to his base. Disgusting! I think your right Facts don’t support you though


No, 95% of conservatives dont give a shit


90% of conservatives approve of trump, a racist and corrupt piece of shit.


Go tell your friends first before you come here pretending the problem is someone else.


It’s YOU. On the flip side of that, think of how bad it's going to be when he loses. Dude is already sowing doubt in the election results. 2020 is going to cap with a pretty ugly scene either way. Even if Biden would make an awful president is there really a choice anymore anyway? What do people want an old senile creep in Biden or the literal reincarnation of Hitler in Trump. It would be nice to have more choices but there arent any. Ill take an old creep over a facist dictator. There is a book called The Harbinger that is a right wing nut job prophecy: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harbinger_(novel) Which makes it even more pathetic because he needed the military and federal agents to tear gas and flash bang a bunch of innocent civilians to get said photo-op.

SAD. It’s really too bad the poor guy has lapses resembling early onset Alzheimer’s. What’s even more discouraging is the powers that be will never let a solid candidate (with the exception of his advanced age) like Bernie run, or a super intelligent and progressive candidate like Yang gain enough momentum to run. Until the Democrats stop putting their weakest candidate forward because it’s “their turn” they’re destined to lose. What happened to Bernie in 2016 when he was obviously the stronger candidate and had so much fervor and grassroots support behind his campaign was a tragedy. But demented Hillary was still shoved down our throats asks look what happened, we paid for it. Granted Biden probably is the lesser of two evils this time around, but still another weak candidate set forth by his party because it’s his turn. Biden has so many holes in his game that I fear he’s going to get trampled by Trump once again. It’s sad really that the people can never have the candidate that would best suite the office, the one this once great country sorely needs. Ah the bunker bitch came out to do photos to send to his cult. Bunker bitch back in his safe house away from them “people” and fake news outside his bunker. Biden sure seemed to excite all the people who voted for him in the primary It always blows my mind that a Bernie supporter would actually not vote against trump. But alas, they are out there. We're gonna need a bigger tent soon I mean, this could be the *last* election so...might as well vote to save democracy! Every single Evangelical Christian is totally fine with this. Tear gas, concussion grenades, pepper spray, rubber bullets, batons. FTFY. At last, someone with common sense. Bernie will always be in our hearts and he will influence a Biden administration, so go vote people I get what you’re saying, but I also think it’s the responsibility of the candidate to creat excitement. At this point, I don’t know how hard Biden actually has to work for the vote. Trump is imploding. Biden just needs to stay out of the way and avoid any scandals or misspeaks. Just Martha trying to paint Kelly as a Muslim lover 
Again? She is a snake like trump. I was watching it live yesterday here in Portugal, i didn't sleep all night. It felt unreal, I'm speechless. I was Buttigieg to Biden but if Bernie has gotten the nod, you bet your sweet ass I’d be voting for him and trying to convince others why they should too. Thank you, friend. I posted the same thing above but I'll say this... I do like Biden. I worked extremely hard for Bernie, and Biden was literally my last choice. That being said, I plan on RUNNING to the polls to vote for Biden on election day. It's a really easy decision. Agreed ‘Shoot em in the leg instead of the heart’ is not a great leader.  Sorry.  This astroturfing post isn’t going to work. Is Canada taking applications cause I’m with you.  At this rate there will be nothing left of “America” by November.  I hope he is taken out in cuffs. Sure hope the Biden Bros can stop disrespecting Bernie Supporters and perpetuating myths Well no shit? What would the alternative be? Voting for anyone else would be a vote for four more years of the destruction of America. They didn't all use law enforcement to fucking throw the church's own fucking personnel out of the church to use the building as a prop

Fucking bOtH sIdEs bullshit I took the Warren to Sanders to Biden route. Can't say I've really been disappointed with any of them. Glad he's stepping up and hopefully that will continue to impress on the skeptics. I guess all the bunker boy comments finally got to him, and he had to go out and assure his base he isn't the weakest President ever to disgrace the office. We’ll take it however we can get it. Show me a public cry. I literally can't find one But as we're already seeing, they can refuse to report the data. Normal behavior for the anti-christ. Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley are both going to be running for 2024, and they combine Trump's authoritarianism, white nationalism, and populism all in a package of not being a totally fucking moron. Awkward. > Well let me clear this up. I meant you can delete your FaceBook account. It's hard to stir up people that aren't actively consuming content. Nope, just hydroxychloroquine and disinfectant. Well let me clear this up. I meant you can delete your FaceBook account. It's hard to stir up people that aren't actively consuming content. Piss off If I can't get Bernie, I'll vote for Trump again just to destroy this country. If I can't get what I want then I'll do my part to burn this country down. 

&#x200B;

Just kidding. That's ridiculous. he’s literally helping free rioters "My vote is precious, and I'm not going to just give it to any candidate."

Vote however you see fit.  Just realize a revolution is coming, and it's not the one you're hoping for.  I'd also keep in mind that 4 more years of Trump means 4 more years of them entrenching young conservatives on the courts that will strike down every bit of legislation that would help for a generation to come. Blame those one percenters for the tear gas. Just there to cause mayhem. Dude. I meant his handling of the riots/protest/craziness. Not one photo op. Way to have tunnel vision I'd switch the order myself, Biden being preferable to Sanders.  But both are an order of magnitude of orders of magnitude better than Trump. He ordered state officials to do something? JFC this guy is totally off the rails Yup, really doesn't do much to help enthusiasm to trash your candidate.  Attitudes are infectious.  Model the attitude that will achieve the best results.

Biden is a good candidate. We say that now, but I have this sinking feeling the next Republican president will be worse than Trump.  Think someone just as evil, but actually smart.

Guess we need to do our best to make sure a Republican never gets elected again. Nothing false about them being friends of Biden.
KKK and Neo Nazis all they are mentioned for is to pump up some anti Trump narrative. 
KKK has something like 300 members not even relevant. Fellow Bernie supporter, I don't think much of Biden, and find the DNC's handling of the last 2 elections to be quite troubling...enough to really want to be a disrupter rather than a supporter...

...but if he were just facing a bad Republican, that would be one thing. A gas lighter who literally can't operate within basic truth, gets advice from the worst, more off rail advisors, and who keeps blatantly taking aim at all kinds of human rights...just to name a few disqualifying traits...sorry, that's gotta go. Lol they are really downvoting you for this! insanity I'm sorry, but any Bernie supporters that won't vote for Biden in November simply does not understand how bad things are in the country. If you're not willing to vote for Biden because he's not Bernie, you are being incredibly selfish, short sighted, and wilfully ignorant. 

This is Trump on his good behavior right now. He's up for reelection this year. If he doesn't win, there's a very good chance he's going to be arrested and sent to prison. If he wins, he has nothing left to lose and things will get even worse. The republican party has all but given up on enforcing the checks and balances system on him because he's making them richer. 

If you don't vote for Biden because you're trying to prove a point or are doing a protest vote for a third party, if trump gets elected, it's your fault I am honestly having a difficult time even considering voting for Biden. I'm sure as hell not voting for Trump but I feel like the democratic party and the DNC are trying their hardest to repeat 2016. I have absolutely no faith in Bidens ability to win the election. 

The democratic party has been so deaf to the large majority of us Bernie supporters I feel like my vote for them would just be taken advantage of. I very reluctantly voted for Hillary in 2016 and was obviously disappointed with the results, especially that Hillary was even put up for nomination. 

My position for the election is that I won't be surprised if either party wins, I'll just be more disappointed if it's Trump. But honestly, other than reading blood boiling news about the retards in chief daily, the president's actions barely affect my day to day life. I'm just embarrassed to be a citizen when our leaders are pure garbage in -> pure garbage out. 

Idk, maybe by November I'll change my mind but I'm currently not looking forward to any of this. He was for me. There was obviously no body that theses corrupt af GOPers were more afraid of for whatever reason. In my mind the only goal has ever been to end the mad clowns rule. I think Biden is not what we need right now.  He was second to last on my list in the primary, after Bloomberg.  Yes, I would vote for Marrianne Williamson or Tom Steyer over Biden.  

But Voting for Biden is harm reduction, and I am not so far up my own ass that I won't make the tiny effort to curb the dumpster fire in the white house. Ham fisted.  A most obvious and blatant ploy, but the evangelicals will eat it up. Favor to ask! When you are posting, maybe just stop at saying he wasn’t your first choice? Lots of people said “I don’t like Hillary but I’m voting for her” and as time went on, that ended up just getting distilled into “I just don’t like Hillary.” That kind of language has an effect and the more you say it, the more it hardens. Not so much for you, but the people who read your posts. Thanks in advance and welcome aboard! Thank you! This couldn’t come at a more important time! That was one of the dumbest things I have ever watched.  It’s right up there with that idiot Devin Nunes’ “midnight ride”. Meanwhile, Joe Biden was actually IN a church yesterday speaking with black community leaders. Why we support Jews? You sound like an antisemite. Bernie is done....shut up about Bernie Oh ponte de lima is a lovely place to be. I usually spend a few weeks there every summer, do some nice barbecues with my friends and all! America must also be an amazing place to be, I'm not a city creature but some of your natural reserves just look out of this world. Best wishes for all of you, I hope America goes through this. I’m with you. Shoot them in the leg...guy. ugh "us guys"? another example of what an inept leader and person he is. Yo be kind guys. I voted trump 2016 mainly because the Clinton's I'm sorry but her only real campaign point was look I'm a woman and Obama likes me. Trump at the time seemed like he wanted to help and honestly the job market come 2017 was going great so I thought "ight bet I made a good choice." Now I'd like to apologize I'm still a Republican I still believe in keeping the government out my business no hand outs (I donated my stimulus check, used my son's to buy him toys) but as of this election I gotta vote dem. Biden seems alright alil weird with the way he talks but eh. This whole bs with calling in military and trying to make him self seem like a god (that photo OP seemed alil to N. Korean to me) he needs to go. Come on guys a lot of us Republican bois and girls are with you but you have to quit lumping us all together thinking we are all crazy ass racists. It's a small minority that's making all of us look bad same for y'all we see that all dems ain't crazy ass hippie dippie screamers. I'm afraid it's slowly catching up to us, there is a newly formed party called (enough/chega), that's just reached the third place in the polls (6%) and they're preaching the same ideals as Trump. Let's hope it doesn't go any further. I don't know for certain but I believe the lights always stay on and that the turning off of the lights here was to make it easier to defend incase protestors tried to enter. Ok. Put those words he said in Trumps mouth. Objectively, what would be your response? I’m voting for Biden simply to get Trump out of office. I don’t care if Biden takes a nap for his entire presidency as long as mad king trump it out. This was like the 20th lynching (public execution of PoC, perpetuated, endorsed or tolerant by state officials) in recent memory, and he blames people protesting racism for it. Idk the state of the union is worrying. Every dollar donated to Democrats is a dollar wasted. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the Democratic party is filled to the brim with enablers and "let's work with Trump-ers". This guy Obama seems to have some good ideas, shame he's just some Ivy League professor or something, and has never been in a position to make meaningful change :( I think that all my dead and murdered trans siblings would disagree with you, if they were alive to do it. Broken promises are a lot better than fulfilled threats. I assumed he meant delete FB and you assumed he meant murder. Well, maybe heretics I gotta say, who cares, though? I don’t like Trump, but literally every single president in the entire history of the USA has used religion as a prop. Non story. > because I really do believe the large majority of people already know and believe black lives matter. 

Many people do not. Eg, the guy who thought it witty to say "all lives matter" and shot a protestor with a hunting bow.

BLM and the groups do in fact have goals, do in fact push policy, and have been credited for laws passed in multiple states. You can't expect the protest chants to be fully cited essays, especially when "let him breathe" is already succinct at demonstrating an issue with police department policy. I’m spreading the word to anyone who will listen that we should each of us calling for Trump to resign. Our country can’t afford to have him in that office any longer. Let’s get rid of him and then resoundingly beat Pence and the stragglers this fall. But let’s put out the dumpster fire first. Systemic, decades long, institutional racism. Will Donald Antoinette tell us we can eat cake? Serious question. What act of leadership lead you to to this opinion?  May help your point by explaining what moment inspired you. For now they are definitely heading to DC to make him feel safe. Well it looks like now we are protesting the extremely over the top and unnecessarily violent reprisals from law enforcement and over the top rhetoric by the president saying he wants to use the military to "Take care of it". that simple exchange was darkly humorous Is it really that powerful to you to simply see him talking to a few black people? That's not how equality/equity works.

We as individuals don't owe you anything, but we as a society can do better. Attacking people who want to help you and ostracizing people is exactly how you get the divisiveness America is currently stuck in.

I am a straight white man who supports LGBT rights, racial and gender equality, and plenty of other things. Just because I don't live your life, doesn't mean I don't care, and it's incredibly backwards to write off people just because "we don't understand". I'm a liberal and I am not *hiding* anything. Turnip > Trump Can you show us where with a link or something perhaps? I'm seriously soul searching for some leadership right now and not finding anything. I feel like we are lost Apparently he was the first choice of millions, considering he's winning the vote by a wide margin. Evil Word. Same. Are you trolling because you can google: Senator calls for Trump to resign, Democrat calls for Trump to resign etc.

Many Democrats are on record calling for him to resign many times in the past, but he is not going to.  Words are not magic.  People don't just want a meaningless soundbite right now, the Democrats impeached him and now they are focused on removing him via the ballot box.

His party will do nothing to pressure him to resign.  His party is blocking action in congress.  This is why we have elections, for exactly this purpose.  It is up to the voters to vote him out it is literally the ONLY WAY now. I notice most supporters are now holding back the bragging. Protesting abuse of power by the police. The low standards, quality of judgement, militarization and lack of punishment ruin lives all the time and these uniforms just get away with it.

Don’t get me wrong, there are bad protesters. People who just wanna break shit and be trouble. But there are also peaceful protesters being hurt unjustly. If a few bad protesters ruin the movement, why don’t a few bad police ruin the system? There’s also no way this administration is going to make things more just for the people. Trump is incapable of bringing the nation together, only making matters worse.

It started with George Floyd, but the horrible response that we’ve seen has only escalated the issue. If we saw police oversight legislation, strong leadership, and positive examples from the police, the riots would have passed I'm waiting for my deeply Republican dad to post something from his favorite right wing propaganda arguing some bullshit that makes this ok but I too am completely drawing a blank on why anyone could possibly think this is ok. Let’s hope it’s enough. Everything. It’s not normal behavior. Does anyone out there think this is normal or productive in any way? It’s like Trump wants to make it worse. I agree. Is there anyone out there that thought this was anything less than insane? How could anyone pull the lever for this kind of instability? Is there anyone that thinks this is normal behavior? That doesn’t make any sense. But some people can’t help being stupid. I think they want all four cops arrested and charged. Oscar’s for best actor goes to Donald j trump . Instead of bringing reforms for police brutality against citizen. Or passing and executive order  to bring systemic change. He is provoking his base to riots by doing this . By saying looting starts shooting starts . By saying vicious dogs . This president has brought the standards of USA presidency all time low . He clearly doesn’t care or understand leadership. He is just Racist , he will do anything to win at cost of people’s life and well being . WAKE UP AMERICA VOTE HIM OUT OF OFFICE. We cannot afford to have another 4 years of this man . Question, do they turn off the lights every night or was this really a deliberately timed message? I believe people grossly underestimate the impact of cannabis prohibition on the general trends of erosion of civil liberties, escalation of police power, militarization of police, and the myriad problems associated with criminal justice and jail conditions.

Not merely the "war on drugs". That is a farce. The war on drugs for decades has made its core focus on marijuana. The pot leaf was made the very symbol of drug prohibition. The public, and industry, were conscripted into this debacle, and drug testing became ubiquitous in the workplace, the only drug that can be reliably tested for in a subject who has any length of advance notice being marijuana.

The whole structure of policing from top to bottom has been invented around drug prohibition, and marijuana is the reason drug prohibition can be made to reach the mammoth scale it has done.

And there are people reading this who have been conditioned to dismiss these comments entirely. Which is part of the propaganda campaign that has kept cannabis prohibition at the forefront of the law enforcement for as long as anyone alive can remember. 

We allowed this country to redefine due process and the concept of unlawful search and seizure as part of a desperate and persistent campaign of marijuana prohibition.

Somehow, people who don't believe cannabis is important, don't understand the harm that has been done to their own constitutional rights in the monumentally foolish effort of prohibition. 

And it's only been in the last hot minute that marijuana could even be *discussed* publicly in any context whatsoever. Advocating legalization was political suicide, and at the national level, remains so. 

Legalizing marijuana doesn't roll back a century of steady development of the engine of prohibition, but taking away the root cause and insisting that it not be replaced with something else, is the only hope we have of ever restoring civil liberties and sanity to this nation.

Unfortunately, it's on the back of these effects that a despot like Donald Trump was allowed to emerge. If the past three generations hadn't insisted on surrendering their constitutional rights in the interest of prohibition, we might be able to exercise them now. We had 51% last time. Let's go for way more. I understand what you mean. I'm still fluctuating. Yeah this will surely calm people down.

Great work chief! People can't change? I didn't know that he did that at some point but I don't like calling someone a violent criminal for something they did a long time ago if that person changed a became a better person. Was Biden’s anyone’s first choice ?  Seriously wtf.  Defiantly voting for Biden and donating. But wtf? He's on the ropes but the next move he's threatened is going to make Kent State look like something from Mayberry.

Is the demonstration in DC prepared to take casualties or has the sacrifice thus far been for nothing? Your in for a penny, *call his bluff*. 

Make him take some action that nobody can even ironically claim is in violation of no criminal statute. The only reason he's still in office is because he has arguably done nothing that's specifically forbidden by any particular criminal law.

Keep him on the ropes until he is desperate enough to do something that even his enablers in the Senate must agree is a crime with a statute someone can cite. 

Then you have an impeachment that can prevail.

Now the question: Is ordering the regular army to open fire against civilians actually a crime with a statute describing it? I'm a Bernie supporter as well and honestly this election might even be more important than 2016, I don't want the US to become an authoritarian dictatorship. We successfully impeached him, and he evaded conviction because the Senate ruled that the President is above the law, beyond suspicion, and cannot be investigated.

That ended the Republic and placed us under a new totalitarian state. 

We are somewhere between surrendering to a coup and literal revolution. I just used Jew in a sentence.  I must be a nazi. But not, say, Cubans?

I live in CA. My vote is meaningless either way. Your implying that I’m out of line in even lightly criticizing his diction suggests that dog whistles are never worth calling out. Unless they are, but only why you deem them worthy. 

So which is it? 

When are dog whistles... dog whistles? Yeah I look around wondering who is a piece of shit and who isnt. Yet when that argument is used to justify universal healthcare publications like NYT scoff. Unless I was a child and legally obligated, that would be my last contact with him, close family member or not. This is abuse, and you have a duty to yourself to exit an abusive relationship. Ugh as am i..... Wow.  When did I do all that? What's my favourite color? I know. Now you accuse me of being “iamverysmart” or something similarly lazy. 

Look, I get it. You don’t think his comment deserved any sideways glances. It was entirely incapable of being anything but lazy prose to you. 

But if he had said “thug” and a black dude was like “ehhhh” would you similarly say “come on it’s a perfectly cromulent word here!” As well? There is no such thing as "Antifa". Yikes. Why did they go to a shithole country like this instead of going someplace relatively safe like North Korea or Qatar? What's wrong with Muslim women, again? He's bluffing and he knows it's safe. The demonstrations are waning, the rioting is losing fuel, the leadership of the movement is exhausted, incarcerated, and will soon succumb to Covid-19 symptoms. This is Trump's idea of claiming victory while distracting everyone to his chosen outrage. He has given no such military order and he won't. But the suggestion that he could is driving the kind of instant feedback that political campaigns pay tens of millions of dollars and spend months acquiring. Yes of course I am listening and do not disagree it is wrong. I just disagree with the methods of coming to a solution. I would argue 95% or higher of conservatives aren’t racist and agree black lives matter. I just don’t think any of this is going to help and would argue it’s just making the political divide even worse. While peaceful protest draws attention to the problem, it’s obviously clear we are all aware of it, so where’s the solution going to come from.

I did see a suggestion in this thread about making internal police affairs public so bad cops are weeded our, which is an idea I liked. So maybe protest for that instead of just the broad term black lives matter, because I really do believe the large majority of people already know and believe black lives matter. To Trump's cult, Episcopalians are basically Satanists anyway. It’s clearly not that my ability to comprehend is limited, so let’s keep out the childish insults shall we? I dare say my comprehension is above average. Come now. You can manage more inspired obloquies than that, surely. 

However, I also have a lot of experience with comments like that being coy swipes at Jews en toto rather than, say, Israel. 

Never mind that he didn’t point out that Cuban population which is larger and more frequently courted by candidates looking for swing voters in Florida. It’s solely “the Jews.” Or working class voters in MI, MN, WI. Nope. The Jews. 

Forgive my perhaps quick jump to assuming the worst, but years of watching even liberals go from “I don’t really hate Jews, just Israel,” to “but the Jews have undue influence really” has acclimated me a fair bit. Maybe I simply, I dunno, have a different experience set than you leading me to different schemas in how I process these things?

So no, not a lack of comprehension— again, I’m quite good at that thank you very much— but a plethora of experience that leads me to look at comments like the original one askance. 

Or maybe I’m just an absolute complete buffoon (despite clear erudition). Let’s go with the most prosaic option. The murder conviction rates for them is why people have such little faith in the system.

I mean, are you even listening to what people are saying? This happened a month ago in Dallas and it flew under the radar :/
It’s not letting me post the link but look up Dallas police suffocation. Man called cops for something with his schizophrenia and they knelt on his back while he screamed you’re going to kill me until he died.

Both cases are fucking awful and these police should be held accountable. I’ve just felt as this whole thing is creating an even larger problem with no clear goal.

Edit: By no clear goal I mean things like this are never going to stop. People have been murdered unjustly since the beginning of time and I unfortunately don’t think it’s ever going to stop. Some people are just horrible hateful people and that will always be true unfortunately. I personally think so as of now. If I’m not mistaken he was charged with 3rd degree murder awaiting further trial. I think it’s very possible it could be 2nd or even 1st degree, but that’s what the further trial will be for. Of course he would say something to protect murderers who wear a police uniform. I will definitely be voting Biden, because the results from 2016 showed me not to waste votes on the popular vote, because boomers are  fucked up. Thank you for actually offering a solution to this problem. I lot of my problems with this whole protest is no clear goal. Making these internal affairs less private really does seem like a good solution and I can’t believe this is the first I’m hearing of it. With all this hatred and violence actual solutions get lost sometimes so thanks for answering my question. Trump won't leave office after losing in a landslide, will claim voter fraud and rile up his base to commit violence before and after the election. It wouldn't surprise me if 1 million of Trump's brownshirts (like those who post on T\_D) with guns will be on the streets committing violence left and right and repeatedly clash with pro-democracy protesters in a futile attempt to install Trump as a dictator. In the worst case, we may have a low level violent right-wing insurgency for years. We need a plan for that. Dear Dr. Redfield,

We write to express significant concern regarding the recent decline in routine childhood immunization rates in the United States during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and urge you to take immediate action to encourage and support routine pediatric immunizations through the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to recent data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a decline in provider orders for non-influenza childhood vaccines, and measles-containing vaccines including the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, began one week after President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [1] In May, the Michigan Care Improvement Registry found a drastic decrease in vaccination rates among children across nearly every age group. The percentage of children five months and younger who remain up-to-date on recommended vaccines declined from 67.9 percent in 2019, to 49.7 percent in May 2020.[2] The New York City health department reported a 63 percent drop in the number of vaccine doses administered to children between March 23 and May 9, including a 91 percent drop for children ages 2 and above.[3]

The administration of routine pediatric immunizations remains critical throughout the duration of this public health emergency. The decline in immunizations is largely attributable to efforts by families to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce both their exposure to, and the spread of COVID-19. But if this trend of decreased immunization rates among children continues, the United States could face yet another public health crisis: increased risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Such outbreaks would put lives at risk, and place additional stress on our health care system and public health infrastructure at a time when these systems are struggling to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To avoid this potential crisis, we urge the CDC to immediately develop an action plan that incorporates targeted public outreach and education efforts on addressing vaccine hesitancy and emphasizing the importance of pediatric immunizations; resources for communities that have seen reductions in their immunization rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and guidance for parents and families on how to safely access pediatric immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including best practices regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) use and other precautions to limit the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in health care settings; and necessary efforts to ensure rapid catch-up for children who are not up to date on critical pediatric vaccines.

In addition to developing the plans described above, we request that you respond to the following questions no later than July 1, 2020 to help us better understand how the federal government is working to address the alarming drop in pediatric immunization rates: 


1.   What specific steps is CDC taking to reverse the dramatic drop in vaccinations since mid-March? 


a.   How does CDC plan to capture accurate real-time data on pediatric immunization rates and identify potential solutions, particularly in vulnerable communities? 


2.   What outreach and education efforts are underway at CDC to address fears among parents and families related to bringing children into health care settings during the COVID-19 crisis? 


a.   Is CDC planning a public information campaign to address vaccine hesitancy, and if so, how will CDC ensure that the necessary communication on the importance of routine immunizations is reaching parents and families?


b.   How will CDC ensure that families receive guidance on safe access to care for children during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the appropriate use of PPE? 


c.    How will CDC communicate with health care workers, and provide the necessary tools to inform communities about the importance of receiving pediatric immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic?


d     What guidance is CDC providing to pediatricians and other health care workers on procedures to ensure that they can safely provide and promote routine pediatric immunizations?


e.    Given the significant increase in unemployment due to COVID-19, many families are finding themselves uninsured. How will CDC raise awareness of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to ensure that families know their children can still access routine immunizations, and how does CDC plan to support participating VFC providers as they work to catch up VFC-eligible children on missed vaccinations, while also preparing for the upcoming flu season?


3.   How will CDC monitor the ongoing availability and ordering of pediatric immunizations, including doses and other essential medical devices, PPE, and other supplies needed to store, transport and administer vaccines, and what plans are in place to address any supply chain disruptions? 


a.   Is CDC taking steps now to ensure that the availability of pediatric immunizations, and necessary medical devices and supplies, is not impacted when production and domestic distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine is underway?


4.   Has CDC developed or reviewed modeling or projections that predict the potential impact on future vaccine-preventable outbreaks if the current pediatric immunization rate continues throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic? 


5.   Does CDC require additional resources from Congress in order to support efforts to reverse the decline in pediatric immunizations? If so, what level of funding would be sufficient? 


We appreciate your timely response and look forward to working with you on this critical issue. I'm aware of how some people use the word Jew.  That does not and  should not make it a verboten word.  He made a valid comment.  You don't get to redefine it based on your limited comprehension abilities. Because its not just one bad cop or one incident this is decades of police violence against marginalized groups with no accountability. How many cops kill a man and walk or get fired and moved to a new precinct, it needs to stop. We need to make internal affairs less private and more publicly known root out the bad cops from the system. 1, 4 cops were involved in the death of George Floyd. Only one has been arrested and the charge is weak. Cops in Twin cities, not all are bad but we have a real race problem. There are ongoing peaceful protests world wide now, all denouncing the outrageous way black men and women are treated, how much inequality they face, systemic racism, etc. 
2, these protests have been co-opted by people just looking to harm, destroy communities and terrorize people. Just an hour ago someone placed flammables and accelerant in the basement of an apartment building in Minneapolis. Neighbors smelled, called cops, etc. everyone ok, but this is nightly, all night long. Nails on bikes paths. Cars lit on fire. We have a curfew and national guard on the ground. If you need groceries you have to hit suburbs. A lot is closed/boarded up. All buses stopped. No trains for days. It is, in a lot of ways, a war zone
3, the president of the United States just threatened military force for those that oppose fascism. He is starting a civil war over this. We have a constitutional protected right to peacefully assemble and voice our outrage of police murders. 
What can we do? Call your senators and politely ask them to grow a spine, quickly. We need elected officials to stand up to this mad king George wannabe. Some people say “vote” but I’m not sure we’re going to make it that long. That police be held accountable when they obviously cross the line. This is not an isolated incident. Could you imagine this happening to a white person who just went into a deli and bought a sandwich? There are obvious problems in some police departments. Most cops are cool. But there must be an effort to stop the ones who are not. This man is an American treasure. This actually only hurt him. Didn’t make sense to anyone but him. Someone is trying to save their ass.

No way LAPD should have lost control the way they did.

54% of the city budget goes to the LAPD. Was justice served? That’s a reasonable answer. I personally have no problem with protesters whatsoever and support the freedom of speech. Not trying to be insensitive but what is it that they are protesting for now? Like what do they suggest be done? People in the usa are this fucking stupid?  Ya, it's about abortion. It's called the fucking Bible belt people really this fucking clueless It doesn't even make any sense.  If George Floyd hadn't been murdered by the MSP police there would not have been protests. >lurking

>brigaders Scumbag In response to what? The looters and thugs are not the protesters. They are opportunists. They are not going to help. They only hurt the cause. These are two different groups of people. Bullshit,  Soon to be ex-chief moore is a f-ing idiot! My crackpot, 100% specialtive, totally unfounded theory: 

*There is more to the counterfeiting story.*

Lost in the noise is the detail that Floyd was originally brought to the attention of the police for a counterfeit bill. Nobody makes just one counterfeit bill. There is a counterfeiting operation in Minneapolis.

Now what if there is more to the connections? The police who responded to this call happen to be involved in that counterfeiting operation. And by murdering Floyd, the witness has been silenced who could have connected those dots. The cops honestly and genuinely believed they would get away with this. It's quite an uncanny outcome that the murder was caught on video and that it was consequential. Whatever consequences the police officers expected from their extrajudicial killing, that was preferable to being connected to a counterfeiting operation.

Usually when a perp ends up in the morgue the cops get a paid vacation. These cops certainly didn't expect the country to be burned down because of them.

It would explain why the cops feared something more than the optics of murder.

Could there be something *much* bigger than what appears to be face value in this case? How big is the coincidence that Chauvin knew Floyd, and just happened to be the cop who responded to this particular call? Minneapolis isn't that small a town. 

Where is the bill, and just how much effort has gone into investigating its source? Is the Secret Service taking it seriously? 

Am I completely insane for wondering if there might be a lot more to this story? People frequently use “the Jews” as a dog whistle. 

He clarified his case. But I still think his statement was quite clumsy at first. 100% agreed And all you do is bitch about the guy who is promising to do just that. We have had enough of you here. Go be a republican or something. Yes it is a rebuke and you're wrong.  Own your own brain ffs. His words dont convey what you claim.  Almost the opposite in fact. You're correct kfh.  Some people are having reading comprehension issues and are blaming you for it. I don't want to get married, therefore Marriage Equality™ doesn't benefit me. The only ones who wanted to get married were conservative homonornative, cisgender gay men (and quite a few lesbians, too.) "I want to get married legally!" wasn't exactly a priority item on the trans agenda, okay?

I wanted - and still want - comprehensive legal protections (employment, credit, housing, legal recognition, etc.), but there was never any real political will for that. (Again, it's helpful to refer to how trans people have been treated during the Gay Liberation era. It hasn't changed much.)

Just give us what we want and help us keep it - as far as I can tell you, the trans community wasn't asking *that much* from you in the first place!

P.S.: I am a historically aware 38 year old - I don't have to be old to know what to be angry about. And a lot of those dollars are Republican dollars from fed up Republicans I bet. I never said that. 

I said that writers are responsible for the impact of their words. That’s okay! 

How many times at work have you rethought an email to managers or even coworkers? Communication is a skill. 

I’m not silencing you. I’m lightly criticizing your diction. It’s not even a rebuke. Ok, I'll not talk then. Enjoy your life and learn nothing. I don’t know what the hell is going on in Texas for you but clearly it isn’t working for you. I’m not familiar with any local laws or things that impacted the Houston LGBT community and maybe where this problem stems from. I live in a more liberal northern state and, to me, I don’t know that that is happening here. Maybe try going to another state? Would Austin be any better? Biden is the democratic trump, but hey a democratic trump is better than a normal trump. You are either old, therefore how have I failed you (i’m somewhat young). Or young, and we’re around the same age, so once again how have I failed you. 

What do you mean you can’t get married? Why not? I honestly don’t know and now trying to learn but you’re being pretty hostile to someone in the internet that hasn’t wronged you. You are isolating yourself outside of the lgbt community, I haven’t  done that. Maybe others have, but I haven’t. 

You say the LGBT community has failed you/forgotten about you after marriage equality. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the LGBT community as a whole isn’t doing too hot since 2015 due to the president. We got a quick feel good moment and then this guy came in. Have “we” forgotten you? Or are we simply pre-occupied with all the things trump is trying to strip away from the lgbt community? 


And just to add, I’ve said and meant LGBT community a lot. I didn’t say gay or lesbian community. I don’t understand how you think legislation that helps the LG community doesnt also help the T community. What specific actions are needed to help the T community that the LG community isn’t working towards? I'm sure most of us Bernie supporters will vote for Biden. Is he our preferred candidate? No. Do we even like him? Not really. But holy shit Trump has gotten so bad it's not even good for the memes anymore. Hey, Biden wasn’t my first choice either, but I’m with you. ❤️ The oath requires them to take up arms against domestic enemies. 

There is no Republic.

There is no legitimate government, no rule of law, and the military is in the service of a despot. Well, Biden was probably one of my less favorite primary runners but he’s certainly an improvement on the current occupant so here goes my vote. Gonna be ready for the 2024 primary after Biden wins this year though. Will this guy still have a job by the end of the week? Looks like he knew how bad he stepped in it as soon as the words left his mouth. I will reluctantly fall in line, again... We cannot continue with a president who gasses peaceful protesters for a bible humping photo op. I'd be saying the same thing if it was a conservative protest. Abuse of power in the most petty way possible. I originally supported Bernie and hoped he got the nomination but I will definitely be voting Biden come November. Lurking brigaders and trolls. Meh, it's a bluff. He's given no such order. So who has a match? Can we get that thing lit or what are we waiting for? I wonder if this has anything to do with defunding schools and paying teachers 12,000 a year less than a McDonald's manager? I'm sure Zuckerberg's private security is even better than the Secret Service though. The writer is responsible for what his words convey and imply. There’s shared responsibility. You know what the thing is? So many self-identified "allies" promise us so many things - it has become my fierce opinion that the trans community has gotten used to living off *promises* and *hope* and whatever crumbs and leftovers the liberals *might* feel are politically palatable to "give" to us.

Funny how that wasn't the case with Marriage Equality™ - if I remember my recent history correctly (which I'm fairly sure I do), the gay and lesbian communities *promised* the rest of us that they'd help us out with getting equality and/or equity once Marriage Equality™ became legal.

I remember reading about what happened after the courts finally let the L and G folks get married - they shut down their political organizations that they set up to lobby for this, the money spigots that funded them, and pretty much took their ball and went home.

You got Marriage Equality™, and we got... nothing.

For a more recent example, I live in Houston, and I was here for the whole Equal Rights Ordinance debacle in 2015. I can tell you, from live experience on the ground, that it wasn't the conservatives that threw trans folk under the bus - we already knew what their plan was and how they were going to present the inclusion of trans people (Their plan worked so well that it has been used again and again.)

It was our supposed liberal *friends* who threw us under the bus! Turns out that defending trans folk from transphobic attacks wasn't a successful fund-raising tactic, so instead, they just... sat on their laurels and treated it as their standard fund-raising/lobbying operation.

Trans people in Houston had legal equity for all of 4 months (if that) because we were deemed too politically expensive to defend.

I haven't even gone into the 60-some-odd years that the "LGBT community" has tried to minimize and shut out trans people!

There is history to support my perspective on this! There is evidence!

You need to show us why trans people - hell, why *I* - should trust you, because as far as I am concerned, you don't *deserve* my trust.

You've failed us far too many times, and it's not "on accident" after the first time. Implications are your thoughts not mine. We will always support Isreal. Nothing will change. It's an wsay way to get pro Isreal people. No different than pro lifers.

Your just a tool to see what lobbyists give money to house and senate members. So why are you attacking me? Hate? 

Do you see what’s happening? OH GOSH GOLLY GEE! A... A... A WHOLE BUNCH?! NOOOOOOOO! WHATEVER WILL WE DO, WALLY?! Nah—get the fuck outta here, bro. But it’s super cute that you think you have any remote semblance of authority to decide of your own accord what is and isn’t hyperbole. Super cute. Also, I give not one goddamn shit about your opinion. Yes. And implications matter too. Sure. But saying “why we support Jews” is a super clumsy way of putting this. 

Jews are more than FL.

I’m well aware of the Jewish population in FL. I have some snowbird family myself. How can you equate grenade launchers and tanks, with a civilian AR15? I sense a lot of hate in your heart. Florida is a swing state.  It is the reason both support support Jews AND Isreal.  Go take a look at FLorida some time.  Alot of jews live there and it's a swing state.  There is a reason the USA support Isreal and IT IS NOT YOU!

&#x200B;

Sound wierd?  Go look up the by county data. You mean the same ones NOT protecting businesses, homes, civilians, etc When did I say I have anything against Jews?  read what I said.  why are people so afraid to interpret English these days?  WORDS HAVE MEANING! I'm angry and sad, and terrified... Mostly the last one. I'll do my best. :D Yup me too lol---no walking into the buzzsaw, we need your comments on the politics wall Sounds like you have some shitty friends. 

Those things are wrong. You should be able to exist in public spaces, have protections at work, and not get harassed to death. I’m really surprised you feel your friends don’t support you and that they are Democrats. Seems off to me and that they aren’t really your friends. I know that it may be a tough conversation and I don’t know much about the trans experience, but I would befriend a trans person who shared similar interests as me. And I really don’t think Democrats as a whole hate trans people. Or do these things to trans people. If they were present when these things happen to you, I would expect a Democratic to speak up for you “what would you do” style. 

I still think Biden is the way forward at this point in time. And as soon as trump is gone, we can turn up the heat and keep Biden accountable. If not, as an lgbt person, I would still prefer to have Biden as president for the next four years and go back to the way things were instead of 2016 instead of trump. Greetings from a Portuguese-American! My family lives in Ponte de Lima and Vila Verde. I’m trying everything I can to get rid of him, and if not I’m going back to the homeland. Woo Hoo for Saturday! Moments later:

* https://i.imgur.com/GueSIXp.png Heyyy the countdown starts only a few more days and then the ban will be off

Thank you Backpack for the well wishes, I am begining to think we need to really build up r/dems just not sure how, will try and post content daily I'm certain there were American flags there so: when fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.


That's where we're at. And in only 3.5 years. Congrats GOP, you beat Hitler's record. Well maybe your supporters are just dumber than his. As a Jew myself I’m curious too. 

I’m betting it’s one of those “I don’t hate Jews. Just Israel. But Jews all support Israel so fuck Jews” things. Disingenuous because you presented objectively dissimilar scenarios to what Biden said, and you are saying they are the same.  Most people can tell the difference.  You claim you cannot, which seems hard to believe, but maybe I was giving you too much credit earlier. Happy Cake Day! :D Biden will gain some ground the next few months albeit slowly.  Luckily we get to replace one asshole with another - yet a lesser asshole. A nobody voter that can read the Biden platform...?

And speak for myself?

Edit: As in Joe isn't taking anyone's guns away? 

Trying to reach across the aisle here, friend. :D Do you not realize just how much of what I can or cannot do in daily life (like, you know, exist in public space, or work, or shop, or not get harassed to death by some jerk) depends *entirely* on people being "forced to be comfortable with" me? And that you, in fact, really don't understand the implications of what you've just said?

I am basically being asked to nod, and smile, and pretend that the building isn't burning down while my so-called *friends* all but sign my execution order.

Gee whiz golly, it's sure a great time to be alive! 🤮 How do you propose we use the 2nd ammendment to rectify the situation? Where do things go from there? Yea, it was already listed above, I wasn’t gonna rehash. I’m saying vote for Biden solely on pre-trump experiences. Me too. NOTHING/NO ONE could be worse than Trump. Not sure what the 2nd ammendment has to do with this. Ok, you've got a gun. Then what? What's the winning scenario here? Joe is promising far more things for the trans community than any elected official ever has. Yes. You can’t force people “to be comfortable with you”. And honestly, if you’re like this on the internet, I can’t imagine I would be comfortable with you in person. I’m gay and I don’t know any trans people. I “know of” some at work at other locations through an internal LGBT employee group, but other than that, don’t know anything about the trans experience. But what you’re doing IS making me uncomfortable. I want to learn, but if I met you in person, I would be too afraid to say the wrong thing, so I would likely say nothing.

Tensions  are really high right now, and I’m sure being trans makes this whole situation hurt twice as bad. You’re mad. You have a right to be. I sincerely hope you have a better day tomorrow and for many tomorrows more because I know you’re hurting. 

If you are honestly going to not vote this election, you are not doing yourself or the queer community any good. Because of our previous administration (not solely) I was able to get married. I never thought that would happen as a child. January ~20,2021, we will put pressure on Biden or whoever is in the office to deliver. But it’s important we stay united on this side. We can’t do another 4 years of Trump. I would go back to 2015 any day when it comes to lgbt rights. 


Trans rights aren’t quite on par with gay rights just yet (and I honestly don’t know what more trans people want or expect, I’m still learning). Many people are still there ready to fight with you if you give them a chance. Disingenuous to latch onto to trump or harts comments but not Biden’s? I.... just don’t believe our government should be so vested federally, it really doesn’t serve the people like state and locals, who unfortunately are strong armed by the federal government in the way of funding.  People should support themselves locally and if we are buying into this craziness of preferential treatment, we’ll then we’re screwed She's so articulate and on point. The second was intended to allow an armed populace as a replacement for a massive standing army and police state. You know, the exact army and police state currently being unleashed on Americans.


Oops. They are currently drooling at the prospect of being able to murder looters (ideally black ones). The trans community (and by extension, other trans people, and myself) aren't here to do "favors" for any of *you*. That is not the way this works!

*You're* the ones making our lives into mincemeat. It's *you* that owes *us*. It sounds like people have more of a problem with you. You do trans people no favors. Who TF is down voting this. I live my life *every day* as a trans woman of color - and let me tell you that the liberals who are supposed to be my *friends* are just as uncomfortable with trans folk as the conservatives are! The only difference is the liberals hide their lies better!

I will accede to my experiences over Joe Biden's "promises" - which he will break if doing so gets him what he wants. He will not be the first nor the last to sell the LGBTQ community on "promises".

*You* STFU. I will sadly be voting Biden as well even though I don't agree with 60-70 percent of what he's done in the past as a senator or a VP. You are full of shit. And we aren't buying any of it. Look what Trump has done to the LGBTQ community. He has attacked it and its people. He has banned Trans from serving in the military. He is taking away coverage of health care for transition cost. He is making it okay for us to get fired solely because we are gay.

Now look what Joe Biden plans to do when elected.

Tell me which one is on the LGBTQ community's  side. (if you actually belong to it)

In the mean time, STFU. No❤️ Naaayce! I would like it stated for the record that, as a trans woman of color, I am sick and tired of being forced to vote for The Lesser Evil™, *specially* keeping in mind that I know that everyone is desperate to get back to "normal" - and that the "normal" (circa 2015 or so) that all of you are so desperately after wasn't a safe place for people of color, or queer and trans folk anymore than 2021 will be. I want a seat at the table as much - if not more - than many of you, but what's the point if the meal being served is bird crap with bird crap sauce?

I think I'll be sitting this one out, unless it's a revolution you're really after. So what are they doing about this oppression by the state?

Where is the NRA? Where are the militia??? I’m still angry Considering the alternative is a guy who gassed protesters to clear the way to a cathedral for him to take a photo OP with a bible... I sure hope the Bernie bros can cast a vote for Biden. Only Republicans are enabling both mass murder and corruption like trump Yup This mess didn’t happen because of any gun law or lack thereof. What would happen to armed protesters against DC police and the US military?

You are just trying to focus on something other than your horrible party who got us to this point. Who are you to say who represents what? 🤔 The electoral college messes everything up.


Look what happened to Hillary Clinton. She won the popularity vote by almost 3 million votes. 


Donald Trump won the election because the Electoral College put him through. 


The Electoral College voted on who they wanted to put through, not who the states voted for. 


They're trying to change that in the Supreme Court right now.


What this means? 


The Electoral College will have to vote for who their state voted for. Not their personal preference. That is going to change the scope of elections significantly.

Supreme Court appears poised to let states keep 'faithless electors' out of the Electoral College


https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/13/politics/electoral-college-faithless-electors-supreme-court/index.html OP needs to pay attention.. I have a few friends over there. In NC and CA. I started being angry, but now it's just... sad. I agree, we need to erase this stain from our history. Or at least- force the GOP to come to terms with the crazy cult if personality they created. Concur kinda.  If we get rid of it though, politicans will just adjust their strategies from winning electoral colleges to winning individuals.  It's just trading shit for shit in this country.  Folorida, won't matter ... whoopdie doooooo.

I'm more of a fan of taking florida an splitting the state's electoral college 50/50.  But to gain postively or negatively, you need to use 45 and 55 as the new zero.  And no winner take all shit. All show for votes, wonder what Blacks for Trump think. Ding ding ding I donated for the first time in my life a few days ago and did it again today. Every time I see Trump is reconfirms that I need to go all in with this election. It’s going to be an interesting next few weeks. Be careful with that shit because you will get a knock on your door by the Feds. And if your abroad you’ll be put on a list. Just warning you. Imagine being here. Imagine thinking that your republic is ending and you have to maintain civility with friends and co-worker who are cheering along it's demise. Can't even go out for bread and circuses to take our minds off things. You got it. From the USA, we're trying our damnedest. Let's hope we can hold out until he's voted out of office in November.

And for the love of God, don't make our mistakes. Vote against your far-right demagogues. Even if it means voting for someone who deleted their emails. He did his time and by all accounts had turned his life around. Was mentoring younger men to make better choices and condemning gun violence. Some people are capable of change and growth as human beings, it is pretty shitty of you to to throw his past into it like that. No one here will ban guns, my friend. That cat is out of the bag. 

Why do you think the founding fathers put the 2nd into the constitution?

Edit: And yes, I am totally trying to convince you we are not all far liberal lefties salivating over taking your firearms away. This is a High School Civics question. I thank you. I think if there’s going to be any bans on guns they should apply to everyone in the exact same way, like if civilians aren’t allowed something neither are the cops or military, the military should only be allowed those weapons over seas and on designated training grounds too, I have no problem with guns being banned, nor do I have a problem with no guns being regulated or banned, but I do have a problem with the government and their employees getting exempt from it, it’s spitting in the face of the second amendment when they do that. Don’t forget the fucktarded electoral college Don't listen to that, said commenter does not represent the Biden platform.

Or mine, for the matter. "Kroll, who has appeared at a campaign rally with Donald Trump and praised him as a “wonderful president” for his support of the police, has long had run-ins with politicians seeking to reform policing in Minneapolis.

In 2007, Kroll called then congressman and now Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison – who is Muslim and black – a terrorist because he pushed for reform of the police."

Right here is your problem. Hey, OP and fellow American.

I love guns. I love the range, I love hunting respectfully for the prey, and I received my responsible gun training from a police officer on said range.

I'm also a Dem voter!

They are not mutually exclusive. 

Dems are as a party about responsible ownership, responsible training, and making it harder for people to have grenade launchers, tanks, and most commonly AR15s. 

No one needs that stuff unless you're in the military.

What do you think, fellow voter? Glad to hear you're ridin'! That’s true, but literally everyone should be for the 2nd amendment, I hate that it was taken and twisted in a way that people believe it only benefits republicans, it benefits everyone. Lmao what? What’s on my mind is why no one is using the 2nd amendment, it’s a perfect time to, except the people that are for the 2nd amendment are also on Trumps side and the people against it are on the other side, how tf am I a coward? You really love insulting people with different political views huh? Awesome. This is music to my ears. You let me know if you have ever have any questions and be sure to tell me if anyone ever makes you feel unwelcome. We value your opinions and your support. :D Fuck him Racism at an all time high??? Don't you think that's a bit of a reach? Me too, I am seriously trying to talk my family into liquidating our assets and getting the h311 out of this looney toon country. People like you got us to this point. Wow that’s what is on your mind?

Not why your party is shit?


You are a prime example of a coward Republican. Right on bro! ❤❤ I'm a lifelong Dem and I've always had guns, and I always will. Not all Dems are dismissive of the right to keep and bear arms. Kinda like how not all Republicans are bigots You too.


They used tear gas on peaceful demonstrations here yesterday because it was 7:30 and I guess they wanted the crowds dispersed.


We have curfews now.🙏 The military is being called in to murder unarmed protesters and press.


You think if they had guns that would calm things down? That is an option. You should get out and explore the world little bit gain some perspective POTUS is their hero. Yea people on youtube say a lot of shit. Many of them are paid shills. They do not represent us.

The limitations I mentioned above are the official stance of the Biden campaign. Do not let anyone tell you he is anti-second amendment and neither is the democratic party.

Here is the Biden campaign's official stance on gun control if you want to see the more detailed version. 

* https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/

You have come here to tell us your views. I only ask you to hear ours, without all the rhetoric. We owe each other that much. It’s a false, dishonest narrative. But let me ask...who do the KKK and Neo Nazis embrace today? Oh yeah...the Tweeting Cheeto. You sound kinda crazy. Please show me proof. Well I’d imagine plenty of them are police boot lickers and Trump worshippers so they’d be on the opposite side of things, what I’m saying is that y’all liberals should be taking advantage of that amendment too instead of trying to take it away, it’s literally there so the people can defend themselves against a tyrannical government but people have painted it to be bad, the 2nd amendment is for everyone, it’s like the one thing we have that let’s us oppose the government Yes this is the worst part. He is telling Americans they do not have a constitutional right to protest. Which is against the law. There are peaceful protesters and than there are rioters Trump can’t figure out the difference when it’s POC involved They swore an oath. They could honorably refuse these orders. No, you might not want to take it away, that doesn’t mean that no one wants it abolished, I see plenty of young people on twitter tweeting shit like “the 2nd amendment was made by white guys like 300 years ago, can we get rid of it already?” There are plenty of people who want to completely get rid of it, and I’m 100% okay with the banning of automatic military style weapons and other things, but if that’s going to happen it better be for the WHOLE country, not just civilians, cops should have to walk around with the same weapons we do, as well as the military unless they’re over seas, there should be no exception, the second amendment is to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government, how will we do that if all we have is hunting rifles while the police have AR 15s? No no see he'll only use it against terrorists. Which he will be defining. And martial law will last until he decides it's not necessary. Let’s not get cocky! Just VOTE! PLEASE!! I don't want to see the US turn into an authoritarian dictatorship. We are not taking anyone’s gun away. I plan on buying another gun soon myself. Come join us at r/liberalgunowners What are all you second amendment warriors doing exactly? The military is gearing up. To attack America. 

Stupid Ceasar stumbles towards the Rubicon. Once again, no one is trying to take your guns away.  A nationwide registration, closing gun show loopholes, banning military-style automatic weapons with more than 30 bullet cartridges, keeping guns out of the hands of repeat felons and mentally unstable people, is not banning guns.

No one wants to take the second amendment away. Do you see that now? Maybe they do his bidding as you say. 

Stay safe. And thats how a dictatorship starts. Technically you could win the electoral college with nearly zero votes. If enough of the smallest states decided change their method of allocating electoral votes to a coin flip or another equally dumb method. There is no requirement for how states decide to allocate their votes. The examples you are providing bear no similarity to Biden’s comments.  I think that the fears you are expressing are disingenuous. You are being too kind. That would be an upgrade for him. They don't undertand how we vote fucktards into office.  Then you have to explain the bible belt and all that bullshit and swing states and why we support jews (Florida is a swing state), etc.

And people from outside the USA laugh at us thinking we a re a democracy.

I'm in Connecticut.  Am I close? Maybe this year in the mailbox. Half the people in the USA get it.  Hopefully 51%!

Alot of us see him as an idiot.

Alot of us see him as an idiot and use talking points from Right wing media outlets to convince us that it's OK to vote for him.

The USA is s shit hole and I want to leave. Trump is a disgrace. Watching from Canada it’s like watching a great and powerful ally, implode in to a rubble of dictatorship and divided states Joe Biden talks with and shakes hands with supporters while the demonic stays hidden in the deep dark dungeon. Donald j drumpf just did a photo op in front of a church, for those of you who did not see it he had national guard and police open up a walkway for him so he could walk his bitch ass up in front of the church in DC to look at a Bible. His demonic ass was showing it off to the camera like he does his stupid executive signings looking at it like he's never seen or held such a thing in his life of which is mostly true. When it comes to his administration he's just another phony ass Christian. More like that voters get to decide to vote at all. And we are all biting our nails that the fate of the world is going to be decided by the uninformed American voter. Huh, pretty similar to how it feels from inside, too Oops! I wasn't supposed to mention that? I'm sorry. What a fucking scumbag. HE is the manifestation of the of the inspiration behind this uprising Vice President Biden does not have that attribute. 


President Trump does.


This thread is about President Trump. STFU... Well played, Joe. Well played. Let this ride for a bit and try to avoid microphones for a while >Every ~~democrat~~ person of conscience should delete Facebook permanently.

Especially from a security and privacy standpoint. You know there is a solution. Not to mention Joe Biden's segregationist buddies. Immediately! What a shitty time to be in the military. You sign up to defend your country, but all you end up doing is being a tool for Donnie's nonsense with immigration and protests. It's like watching the beginning of the end of the world. Like, you can see where it's turning to shit, and there's nothing that can be done to stop it. This is literally The Night of the Long Knives - the beggining of the Third Reich era, aka Nazi Germany. No government should be using military against unarmed civilians. That is shit we see in Iran, in North Korea, or in other despotic regimes in the world. If that happens in the US, then burn the flag, torch the White House to the ground, and let the country die because it's all meaningless. Trump has destroyed everything this country once stood for. Please, I know this sounds paradoxical (because, ya know, it should be), but you're only encouraging those remotely within his base to support him more.. as someone who is surrounded by his base I truly appreciate the effort, I just have serious doubts as to the efficacy 😕 Keep him hidden and don't let him talk. We need to remove Trump, and this is the garbage fire we were given. Prop him up! You’re welcome What is it like viewing the USA from across the world? True. But he picks the people that he wants to surround himself with. People to do his bidding. People loyal to him and his ideology. If they are not, he makes sure they are gone like the wind Yes. I feel the same. These people, and I'm sure there are more, did his bidding. But it comes from him.


It comes from the top down. Being most of the convictions were related to his orders and he stands to be convicted as soon as he leaves office, yeah I don't see why not. Goddamn, I miss that man. I think the company he keeps should be judged for being with him. So, if a minority doesn’t vote for Biden, they’re still a minority? I’m not sure how it can be defensible for something like this.  It’s similar to defending trumps “grab em by the p***y statement.  I fear that people are supporting people not really based upon their beliefs, but their party allegiance. Kevin Hart made jokes on twitter when it wasn’t socially unacceptable to do so against gays, only since then has it become an issue.  History is full of context and it has to be considered before you condemn it. I think this poem puts it in a nutshell for me.


If you surround yourself with liars, bad "actors", oligarchs, bullies, people who participate in and celebrate criminal behavior?


Well, it says alot about you. 


A favorite poem from my childhood. 


Judged by the Company One Keeps


One night in late October,


When I was far from sobe

Returning with my load with manly pride,


My poor feet began to stutter,


So I lay down in the gutter,


And a pig came near and lay down by my side;


Then we sang “It’s all fair weather when good fellows get together”,


Till a lady passing by was heard to say:


“You can tell a man who boozes, by the company he chooses”,


And the pig got up and slowly walked away.


Unknown Not anymore. Biden wasn’t actually claiming to be the arbiter of whether people are black, nor did it seem like he was trying to belittle black people.  Kevin Hart made some jokes that were pretty obviously made at the expense of gay people.

The outrage at Biden’s statement had a lot more to do with people’s willingness or even eagerness to ignore the obvious meaning of what Biden was saying - that you would be stupid if you are having trouble deciding between Trump and Biden.  The proverbial chicken sandwich, versus shit sandwich with little pieces of broken glass mixed in. Nobody thinks he could. The fact that he would make that boast is the joke. Sounds right. The proliferation of fake news isn't just a problem on the right.  There are those are the far left willing to push lies and conspiracy theories as well.  It's a dangerous trend.  Nothing good will come of it. Even if he was caught doing violence, it is still no excuse to murder him. I really can’t afford to donate to a campaign as I don’t get consistent pay in my work but after Trumps “speech” tonight, I donated. You need to research the shit show that existed before section 230 existed What is happening in social media is way beyond free speech.  And there’s a lot of foreign interference. I like the idea of news outlets being financially liable for the bullshit their followers perpetuate. From Portugal, please remove that man. This is horrible for the whole world. Didn't hillary have more than a ten point lead at times prior to the 2016 election??

Fuck these polls.

Vote. The far-left hates the Democratic Party just as much as the far-right does. The far-left is more obsessed with hurting the Democratic Party than they are with defending Americans from Trumpism. Hopefully this squalid attempt to defame Joe Biden will finally shine a spotlight on who these cosplay journalists really are: grifters. Every democrat of conscience should delete Facebook permanently. Zuckerberg put Trump in office and has had secret meetings with Trump to assure him they'll do everything possible to keep him in power. Zuckerberg needs to face treason charges when Trump is out. I'd love to see him on a golf cart riding through these neighborhoods.

Cartman is our president. You mean that Rambo photoshop of him wasn't real?  

You mean the guy who said he would have rushed into Parkland without a gun would have ran the other way?

He's not golfing....he's scared shitless and has no idea what to do. More than 10 yrs ago.  Chauvin has been doing violent shit much more recently than that. I could just see Trump saying, "I love the blacks!  Some of my best employees are negroes!" Creating violence in the streets so they can justify cracking down on the citizens and eliminating "undesirable elements" to restore law and order is straight from every authoritarian playbook.

The republicans will recreate fascism if they aren't stopped.

Edit: and Trump's little speech just confirmed it. Those people are for trump by complacency.  Just like the cops that stood there doing nothing while their co-worker murdered someone in front of them are accomplices to murder by abusing their job duties. You gota realize they are just two sides of the same coin and equally as bad it’s like that South Park episode where Obama and McCain were both in on it boom baby! Polls don't mean shit.
Except the one taken on November 3rd. But. He didn’t. Maybe talk to Kevin hart about his desire to change/take back what he said years ago on Twitter He did do a home invasion and held a women at gunpoint in front of her child at one point in time.. he was murdered violently.. but he was also a violent criminal as well Trump will claim that Biden *was* 10 points behind anyway and that the election results are bogus so be prepared for that.

“These vote by mail ballots are fraudulent! The Democrats are stealing the election!” We saw it with Franken as well. Bail is an essential part of criminal law since money is one of the reasons why people are willing to wait to go under a proper criminal procedure. It may not work the best way in the US but it does work in a number of European countries. Fuck this guy. Crazy idea, but we could probably abolish bail while we are at it. I just want to know what is wrong with being anti fascist. I get that that is directly anti trump, but to call it terrorism?  Pretty telling. More importantly a poll came out with Biden up +6 in Michigan. He doesn't understand that he is exactly what is being protested against. You've managed to terrify me more than any horror movie could. Hoping to get some info on the reps calling for his resignation. DONT TRUST THE POLLS! REMEMBER 2016? PLEASE VOTE! Trump: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/01/george-floyd-protests-trump-puts-top-us-military-officer-in-charge.html She may be the one. The rioters and the protesters are two different groups.  Arrest the rioter by all means. But allow the protesters to do so in peace. Stop firing at them with tear gas and rubber bullets. That's when it turns into a riot. TIL insurance doesn't exist. Remember nov 2016 and the distortion that could be caused by electoral college system. It is not popular vote based election and Russian government is helping him. 
Don’t be overly confident on this. I've had a modest recurring monthly donation since the 2016 debacle.


I may bump it up a bit. Obligatory and unnecessary: "don't be complacent" and "I hate polls like this. We have to get busy" The only violent thing about Floyd was the way he was murdered >The real question is, will our democratic institutions hold?

And the answer, imo, is only if there are no deaths in the supreme court before January. Even FB employees are walking out. brave move to jump the gates.

well handled by those two protestors and the police. This happened under Obama's administration. This has little to do with the president and more to do with the divides across America in general.

You're a very divided country. Didnt they already try that? like his entire presidency? \#runupthescore You can win the electoral college with less than 20% of the popular vote by targeting all the smallest states. Vote like Biden is one vote behind. Says Trump is a wonderful President is all you need to know. This guy is a pile of shit Because Trump skimmed by with the electoral college last time while losing the popular vote by three million and Trump’s base has not grown. Meanwhile, Biden’s popularity is above HRC’s at this point. There’s going to have to be some heavy cheating by the GOP. Well I don’t remember when burning down businesses and homes was called justice. People worked hard for what they had and then to have it burned to the ground is probably not what I would call respect either. But you know since a couple people started rioting who cares about the law anymore. Cause it’s not like it matters at all if your destroying people’s lives as long as you get what you want in the end right? Why are they so afraid of a fair fight period. Funny how dismissing what gamergaters had to say because of the racism and sexism and biggotry was the other side of the "debate" being unreasonable and looking for any reason not to listen, but a few burnt down stores is cause to dismiss black people demanding to have their human rights respected.

Deny, deflect, project. Cuz they’d rarely win Matt Stoller is a fucking idiot. Ok well you must be really stupid to believe that a 73 year old man could stop a school shooter unarmed in the first place😆. God your ignorance is kinda funny. Bootlicker I'm glad the free world is standing up to the US.


I'm deeply saddened it's necessary.  👍🏼 uh no, Biden is leading in the swing states Hillary lost:  


Florida: +3.5 avg biden

Wisconsin: +2.7 avg biden

Pennsylvania: +6.5avg biden

Michigan: +5.5 avg biden Actual police reform?  Reforms of the laws that make it almost impossible for police officers to be convicted of a crime?  The dissolution of police unions that protect officers who have seriously misused their power from being fired?  This isn’t about one person, it’s never been about one person.  We need reform. Yeah Trump said he would run in unarmed to stop a school shooter. Now he's hiding from a protest. He's a lying wimp. What is your definition of justice? The man responsible for the death of George Floyd is being charged for murder and manslaughter and will likely spend a lot of time in prison. The three officers also there have been fired from their jobs. So what is the type of justice you want? I’m not feeling that 90% chance you speak of...but your dad, don’t bother. Gotta just leave that alone as suggested. I mean, really. If not now, then fucking when? 

Let’s go, America!!! Yeah, no.  We have a few rioters who are taking advantage of the situation to reek havoc, and a lot of peaceful protestors who are demanding justice and trying to enact change. Damn... going from obama to trump is like going from Paul Harvey to Howard stern. I would like a moratorium on all posts about Biden being ahead. If every single one of our blue asses doesn't turn up in November, we are sunk. Don't forget everyone in Wyoming gets 2.4 votes to yours, or something like that. VOTE! Truly r/agedlikemilk FascBook Speaking of kool aid...

https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/07/21/trump-i-alone-can-fix-the-system.html If you don’t, and the GOPigs win, the fascists will DO EVERYTHING they can to dig it permanently. They’ll have the Supreme Court, the DOJ, the upper hand. If you think this weekend was crazy, this will get progressively worse (the opposite of progressively better) because fascism will be galloping unrestrained. Compared to 2 points two months ago. Holy shit Duly noted, thank you. And yet there are pro BLM protests going on in other countries. Anyone who has the slightest awareness of Biden's political career knows how laughably wrong you are. Unfair to Trump. You know that he has bone spurs. #biden2020 Truer words were never spoken. Come on Democrats. Please break your history of low voter turnout and come out in droves November 2020. How them boots taste? As you know, people aren't marching because of police abusing and killing one person, they are marching to make sure the police do not ever again abuse and kill another person. 

In the past 5 days some police have been abusing people and press on camera and without provocation.

Do you know what the coward Trump could do right now to be the President of the United States?  He could get on national TV and announce he is creating an agency that would investigate and prosecute any and all law enforcement officers and agencies accused of brutality, starting with the Floyd murder.  

He could say, " I hear you, I hear the cries for change and justice.  We will fix this broken system." 

That's what a leader of the Free World would do. Yet again the responsibly falls on the proletariat to help themselves and each other. so close your fucking facebook Great news. I still hope Australia and India are permitted. Alright bud. You keep on doing your stupid ass democratic things👍🏼👍🏼. Might as well just be communist. 538 breaks down the polls according to all adults and likely voters. They are usually within 3 points of each other,  with likely voters a bit higher for Trump than all adults, but disapproval among likely voters 8 to 10 points higher than approval. You are ignorant if you think this is just about George Floyd. His murder was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Yes. Well half of the country is rioting and looting small businesses due to the actions of one man. The actions of a single police officer don’t represent the entirety of the countries system of law enforcement. If people were rioting and yelling and threatening you at your doorstep would you stand outside? Would you take the risk of being shot... because no one knows how many of them could have guns. He is the leader of our country and some people want him dead. Now tell me you wouldn’t hide in a bunker if hundreds of people wanted to kill you and knew where you were at and were willing to act on it. You can’t criticize someone for fearing for their life. Nice video! We must VOTE to make this happen! Believe no polls. And it has to be a landslide so that Trump cannot refuse to leave OUR White House. Remember when Hillary had a 20-point lead. These polls are jokes Biden is a few points behind in the betting markets and I tend to trust those over polls. >But they are correct to call out Trump's hypocrisy.

Truth is truth. He *is* behind. In every state Trump won in 2016. And yet, Trump leads in *every state he won in 2016*. I don't think I can make that many claims in a lifetime, let alone false or correct ones. True, but Trump's approval has been in that ~45% range consistently. I'm not sure if those polls are typically based on likely voters or the general public, though.

Trump won with 63 million votes in 2016. That's less than 20% of the population. I love him too.  He was a perfect match for Obama. When did I claim non stop protests And maybe that puts him in unique position to help the country heal. Canada, UK and EU have already said that they oppose this move to include Russia in the G7. I see no positives in trying to align with Russia, especially if that means we'll go against our traditional allies. Here come the Tweets.. Don't get cocky folks, Trump used the complacency strategy last time too.  Everyone was so sure Hillary wod win they just didn't bother showing, or voted for Jill Stein like I did. You misunderstood him. That is not what he said exactly. You're taking what he said out of context. He was being sarcastic.

What are excuses used by Trump supporters for 200 Alex. Trump's not completely stupid -- he's trying to start a civil war because it's basically his only chance. Barr's going to help him round up his enemies, you just watch. No I remember protests. Not non stop protests like you claim. Which just isn't true. So this has all just popped up in the last 3yrs. Maybe you do need to drink some kool aid then. Don't vote because you like Biden then. Vote to get Trump and his lackies out. No they get training.  A lot actually.  They have entire schools dedicated to it.  

It’s just not appropriate training for community policing, it treats everyone as the enemy.  Like military training. Yeah I think if he were polling at 52% they wouldnt care. > “I’m not a believer in flag-burning,” the president said on the call.  “And I would think that if a state wanted to try to pass a law that  you’re not allowed to burn flags, with a certain punishment -- a strong  punishment -- I would think that the United States government would be  backing you up all the way.” 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag\_Desecration\_Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment)  


They are trying to revive that shit. I say let em do it but add a provision to enforce the flag code [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/8](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/8). We know who loves to wear american flag gear. Came here to say the same thing. These are “Never Trump” Republicans. They still want the policies we stand against, but from a candidate who does it quieter than Trump does. Damn Lib, the last thing we need is more cops going around choking people.  I know how scared you pearl clutchers are of free range blacks so that explains your love for a segregationist. Does everyone forget katrina... when looters were being shot? “ if you loot, we shoot”.  What do you guys think is going to be the end game here.  You think Everyone is just gonna accept the new norm is destroying cities when they want to protest something?  Yes people are eventually going to get shot.  Quit robbing places and burning them down. It’s very simple No that is actually pump and bolt action. Lever is different Candy ass president bone spurs is and always has been a fucking coward. What would that accomplish? Before all this that's all the news would be every day: X Democrat or organization calls for Trump to resign. 

Trump resigning wouldn't fix police brutality. If he resigned Pence would be President anyway. 

Vote them out. YOU have to do that. True. The takeaway for me is that the U.S. has no moral authority on human rights to be effective in leading the world on human rights issues. Awful regimes can call out the U.S. government on human rights without lying about us. That's very bad for us, and the world. They're definitely not trained, at all. But they're certainly armed like they even get the training. I don't remember mass riots and protests in every city for the past 60 years but maybe I just need some of your kool aid to remember. That might be the dumbest shit I’ve ever heard I think he meant to say ahead. He did in fact share a tweet with a video saying that, yes. But you know, he's still alright for another 4 years. And then you numbskulls will call them "unelectable" when they're not Bernie It's not even just republicans. This whole site is full of people who somehow hate Trump but are also fine with him winning because their main guy lost I wish we had a president right now. Instead we have a troll in the office. You mean ahead, right? So glad to have the president's calming and unifying presence during these trying times. Got to keep it up! Have to spot Trump at least 5 points, imo, because of Republican voter supression, fraud, and an unbalanced electoral college. This isn't just about Republicans either, it's other Democrats who are fine with another 4 years of Trump because Bernie lost or because they only agree with 90% of Biden instead of 100% Trump isn't even trying to be a real President, leading the country through a period of building crises. The stupid thing is that in times like this the country yearns to be led. Anyone who even tries gets some benefit of the doubt and receives bipartisan support, like many Governors from both parties currently. Same guy who was in an underground bunker the other night because of DC protests, right? Projection. 

He’s the laughing stock of the world. Wtf is the matter with you? Send what message? That y’all memed instead of voting in the primaries and your guy lost? 

So now it’s “Fuck it, let the right wing destroy the nation, because I’m a petty political tourist!”?

Is that the message? Cause that’s the message I’m receiving. Another poll had Trump within 3 of Biden, so he could very well be a point or two behind given the MoE Honestly I’m not happy until Biden is 90 points behind. I don’t want Biden to just win, I want to send a message. This is absolutely the measured, thoughtful response I’d expect from the President. Couldn't agree more. He appeals only to his base, and his base isn’t big enough to win him an election.  

I can’t figure out his end game, unless he never wanted the job and wants anything in the world but a 2nd term but his diseased brain won’t ever let him quit, so he’s trying to lose, but then he’ll insist it was only because of rampant cheating.  This protects his fragile ego. Oh, they surely will.  Right now, they are busy trying to  get their messaging straight that antifa is the greatest threat to modern democracy and American greatness, and not other things.

I was watching the Sunday news programming and got to watch the Trump administration official simultaneously call out China in regard to their messaging about the American protests while comically trying to defend Russia in the same conversation.  Spoiler alert, They claim China’s meddling is official business, while the Russian messaging is from “a few bad actors”.  It would be funny if it wasn’t so damn sad.

We’ve been through this for four years.  I would be very disappointed if most Americans at this point wouldn’t see through the BS. Projection. Yes. On and off since the 60s. 
This civil unrest every where has been brewing for decades. The thing I find funny about Trump is he’s trying to win re-election right? He says stupid shit like this because it rules up his supporters who were going to vote for him regardless. This rhetoric just turns independent voters that he needs against him. What a complete moron. I can’t wait to help vote him out in November You are right about Trump staying in his bunker. However, a President of the US should be able to heal some of the pain. Staying in your bunker is an admission that you are helpless. I'm not very enthusiastic about voting for Biden (seems like a nice guy just super out of touch) but I will. Same as I did for Hillary. I really wish the Democratic party could come up with better candidates. > 50yrs of democrat mayors

So I guess they’ve had 50 years of riots then? 43% of voters, which are only 40% of the country.  Its a small number if-- if 10% more people voted they would be irrelevant. Run up the score! Vote to humiliate Trump with an epic defeat. Not good enough. Run up the score. Lets beat him by 20 points and humiliate the fuck out of Trump. Trump has it backwards the world laughs at his ineptness and his inability to express sorrow. Watch as Republicans spend the next few months twisting themself into pretzels trying to drum up outrage over Biden's slightest gaffes while simultaneously downplaying their guy's daily twitter shitfits. That lead aint big enough First, you're a terrible reporter. Second, no it's not and i'll tell you right now, i've been getting calls all day telling me things are going great and we're doing a tremendous job. Polls don't matter. Vote Oh Lordy, we can’t do that again. These are dangerous times & I can't help but feel these are very different than in the past. And sadly without any real leadership at the top, things are getting worse. I hope that things don't get worse but this feels different than times like 1968, much more dangerous [https://magpiebrule.ca/2020/06/01/reflections-on-a-dangerous-moment/](https://magpiebrule.ca/2020/06/01/reflections-on-a-dangerous-moment/) Let's wirk harder to a point that Biden be 80%ahead of TRUMP...let's not make same mistake of 2016 We need to vote to give Biden the Senate. We need to not only defeat Trump. We need to defeat Mitch. They did one better, impeached him. But the senate refused to remove. I don’t care. VOTE Also, the pollsters adjusted for groups they missed in 2016. Groups that didn't normally vote that voted for trump. 

Pollsters build polls based on expected voters of past elections. Trump pulled larger parts of groups that didn't normally vote much, like rural conservatives.

But they are included in these polls now as they are voting. I think he’s lost and asking for directions Minneapolis almost 50yrs of democrat mayors. 
Yep let's blame trump. 
Biden 35yrs in the Senate 8yrs vice president. 
Yep let's blame Trump. You can't help the cult. But the cult isn't the majority. It don’t matter if we don’t vote. Vote. Vote. Vote. This is still way to low. Its actually fucking depressing. I'd put money on it that he doesn't leave quietly. In fact, I was sure that he would refuse to leave when he was first elected and the evidence accumulated since then has only confirmed that belief. The real question is, will our democratic institutions hold? "You don't switch quarterbacks..."

"And that's why impeachment is so hard. But he's had four years and his contracts up. Let's trade him for a quarterback that will actually get shit done and won't kill us all in the process, Hmm?" Nah Trump only needs his people to show up in a few states. Its a gamble but I give it a good chance. I won't believe it till I see it. This could be a "peak disapproval" and by November we are at even polling. Anything can happen. 2020 is nuts. For a lot of Americans the sight of riot police killing black people and reporters is a desirable thing. You can't. Those people are lost. I can't think of anything less calming or unifying than a Trump presser during a crises. Only if we vote for him! Go Joe! I've been struggling to understand — when we protest, contact officials, vote and donate, how do we know if it's working? What does change look like? This article says it starts with police no longer being above the law. It looks like getting all of the Derek Chauvins off the street. At least 17 complaints were filed against him before he murdered George Floyd.

1. Remove police who have used excessive force
2. Take disciplinary action for cover-up attempts
3. Charge police for past crimes


Additional policy solutions from Black Lives Matter Campaign Zero [here](https://www.joincampaignzero.org). Just thought I’d remind you guys that Hillary was supposed to have the same sort of lead in the polls I think you should be prosecuted under that law for fomenting dissent against democracy.

&#x200B;

Oh, you wanted to be in charge of where the line was drawn, right? You hate free speech? DUN DUN Came here to agree to the “run up the score” piece.  No shame in in blowing the competition out of the water. The country is doomed. He's a coward.   Plain and simple. Yes!  Yes! Yes! I understand, but this election is so much more important.  How much longer can Ruth B Ginsberg hold up?  This is HUGE!  Also, if this is how Trump is acting during an election year, what can we expect when he doesn’t have to worry about re-election?   Yes I’m very pessimistic, and I think it’s valid. Trump doesn't care about the protests as long as the police cracks heads. Trump is President only to those who voted for him. Polls that lump states together, but don't give a state-by-state breakdown along with them, are basically worthless. Biden could lose the popular vote among all battleground states but still come out ahead with electoral votes. Don’t get complacent is my point. I don’t like reading that Biden is X points ahead of Trump. Hillary was a shoe in to win just weeks away from election night.  We have 5 months to go.!? In my opinion These polls do more harm than good, this far out.  Maybe 2016 still stings for me, but I can’t help but worry some people won’t vote because they think Biden is x points ahead of Trump. All to distract from his inept response to Covid-19. All he has to do is smile and not say anything and he should win. They see him as a victim of these out of control protesters and that he had no hand in stoking the violence. So to his supporters this strengthens their support, they feel under assault and need to rally together. Minneapolis is a great example of that Exactly, it's a long way off and don't forget the hard lesson we learned from resting on Hillary's lead. 

Donate time to the campaign if you can and pressure everyone you know to vote. 

Let's not just win, let's run up the score. Let's work towards a resounding mandate. Well their hero, is hiding under White House bed (probably behind Melania) and blaming Obama. And? Your point is what? Also remember that this year, we have the benefit of hindsight. Which means (1) I think we’re a little less comfortable with the outcome of polls this year (even though the 2018 polling was pretty spot-on) and that means Democrats will get off their butts and go vote and (2) we now have almost 4 years of the Trump Disaster to look back on, whereas in 2016 we had no idea just how bad it was going to get.

Also, the elections in 2017, 2018, and 2019 make me more hopeful, because they showed us that even in non-presidential years, people will crawl through fire to vote for Democrats. Look at Wisconsin’s judicial election a few weeks back. Cops need to walk in their communities and earn the trust of the communities. Op-eds aren’t the issue at all. OP is bringing up the fact that elected Democrats have not been demanding a Trump’s resignation. OP is correct and it’s an excellent question. Oh please! Be real Also note, this was conducted May 25-28, so only 1 day of polling reflects the most current events.

Just to further add to the complacency note, there is an effect that the largest lead polls get posted rather than narrower ones. This is good news no doubt. New YouGov/Yahoo is +8 today (May 29-30), so that is also good news, but RCP average remains +5.9.

Also, given its tiny in the scale of Reddit's political conversation, I'll say worth joining r/joebiden as its nice to have the Biden specific news, and this sub for more downballot. Run. Up. The. Score.

Keep fighting until January 20, 2021. Keep working on non-political friends. Win at the dinner tables and coffee tables. We win when we vote. We win because we have better ideas and an inclusive vision for America. They have not been doing this. Democrats do not go into interviews and demand that the President resign. I understand the pessimism, but Hillary was losing in several polls at this time in 2016 including the ABC poll that has Biden ahead 10 points. We need to beat trump in a landslide. Everyone has to vote. If we only beat him by anything less than 10% they will attempt to invalidate the election and start a civil war. Everyone in every town across America needs to vote against him and all republicans. Only then will we find peace. Yeah, I'm not counting on anything until Trump is out of the Whitehouse... 



Even if he loses (which I think is no way guaranteed, world is a crazy place), I'm not convinced he'll just leave quietly. I hear too many people refer to the old saying if "you don't switch quarterbacks or game plans in the middle of the game." This drives me crazy because that is PRECISELY what every coach does. When things are going this poorly, you pull the people performing so horribly and replace them with someone who can do better. Yeah fairly. There is no pleasing anyone anymore. He called and spoke with the family. People are blaming him for something that is ilon the state level. Blame the mayor, blame the police chief. The president cant be everywhere and make sure people uphold to values and standards. Its why there is power given to states etc. you act like hes a dictator and has supreme rule over any and everything and its just not the case in america. And how would of the democrats handled this civil unrest any different?
Most of the major hot spots are democrat governed states or cities 
Democrats hands are not clean in all this. 
This is a time when both parties need to shut up. Sit down and listen. > nothings ever enough

This is the strangest take. Because, its not like Trump has done *anything* to bring peace or resolution to the situation. So how can any reasonable person actually believe that what he's done is *enough* lmfao whataboutism in action Right on If dem politicians started demanding Trump resign at this pint in time, it would seem like they are politically motivated rather than willing to address the fact that the country is in flames.  Like they were having a knee-jerk reaction rather than any willingness to address the actual situation ... just as republicans are doing.  Everyone knows Trump is an inept tool bag, what we need right now is a leader, no matter what “rank” that comes from.  And that certainly won’t come from Pence. Salwell has always seemed like a true law and order kinda guy to me. He will be a great asset to the next administration. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eg4pat/the_patriotic_move_is_for_trump_to_resign/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: The police, who investigate crime, and the district attorneys, who prosecute the offenders. The president, who tweets. These are their stories. Do you really think the democrats hands are  clean from this civil unrest? That’s fine. We’ll worry about them after November. I don’t know why pollsters put any statistical value by grouping the states Trump won together in a pot and saying that Trump leads in the states he won. Technically correct, but statistically irrelevant. It’s a state by state battle. 

But you’re right.. just had to rant a bit because there was a CNN poll a few weeks back that did the same thing. Bull$hit. Anyone remember this?  [Hillary has a 93% chance of winning](https://i.imgur.com/gaQLSFW.jpg) Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying. That’s the point. Also, a key takeaway, Biden is polling in the high 40s while Clinton was polling in the low 40s. This is significant because that means there are less undecided voters, therefore the polls are more accurate predictors. I get tired of this argument. During the 90’s crime was rising and everyone wanted safer streets and for authorities to be tough on crime.  This bill was in response to that climate.  That was a different time and Biden has admitted that the bill has flaws.  It still has some things that were good, like the violence against women act and funding for more LEO.  

Certainly, things need to change as we recognize flaws in the current system. Haha 😂😂😂 Do nothing democrat! Trump said it so it must be cool haha


/s I love the ever-shifting goal posts you guys have. I do believe that was sarcasm.. Don't get complacent guys

Biden needs to beat Trump electorally.  In 2016, Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million by won the electoral college by 5 states with just 75K votes.

[Trump Leads Biden in the States He Won in 2016: Campaign Update] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-31/biden-urges-protesters-to-harness-their-rage-campaign-update?srnd=premium&sref=YjKZ1f32)

Biden needs to beat Trump overwhelmingly to show Republicans that this country wants none of the Republican bullshit. Don't worry, guys, he has a 99% chance of winning.

Just like Hillary. I think it would be pretty tone-deaf to start that up one week after we all watched a snuff film. No. This is very bad. This is where things were 30 years ago before Section 230 was put into the federal communications laws. No. Democrats recognizing they're right on Trump's hypocrisy. DJT STFU They should be impeaching him again. Pretty effective strategy much as it pains me to admit. Old republicans tend to double down when they get angry. Looks like 2-10 points ahead depending on the poll...


https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson_vs_stein-5952.html Last August Trump tweeted that Xi should have a nice chit chat with the protestors and “everyone would be happy”.  Now Trump is cowering in a bunker dreaming of “vicious dogs”. lol i can't tell if they hired actual Sam Elliot for the voiceover or the worst Sam Elliot impersonator. I'm not referencing them as an authority on freedom.


But they are correct to call out Trump's hypocrisy. Democrats listening to China!
Interesting. Hiding in a bunker is overkill, but if he were to go out into the protests someone would definitely try to kill him. Where was Hillary polling at at this point in 2016? Not /s, genuinely curious. But the people aghast at Biden using hyperbole to discuss how stark a difference he is from Trump really don’t care that much about Trump’s comments, for some reason.  Wanda Sykes had it right when she said he should have substituted the word “are stupid” for “ain’t black”. Because it would be meaningless?

Better to tell people to vote. Vote like Biden is 10 points behind

After you vote, go find 10 more people Just leave it alone.

It’s more productive to find 5-10 people who weren’t going to vote in November and convince them. 🗳 

It’s not your responsibility to try to convince your dad. Leave politics out of your relationship. It will make you bitter.


Better to win the election and have your relationship with no argument. China is doing this to gi true US it’s own medicine with Hong Kong.

I’d be wary of citing them or using information they publish. I'm afraid with trump, you can't play the quoting game. Beats the shit out of "when the looting starts, the shooting starts". No, the Democrats were going with "by the book." They went by the book because they knew history was watching.

Calling for resignation is pointless. There is no legal basis for it. It would play to the base and thats it. And I'm sure if you look at it up, some democrats have called for it - but then you got Pence. Absolutely this, 100% percent. They should have called for his resignation during the impeachment investigation.  If you are going to impeach, you should be at the same time asking him to resign immediately. Never interrupt your enemy when they’re making a mistake “MAGA loves the black people.” Seeing as Trump has a clear line between MAGA and black people (POC) I think I’ll take an empathetic man appealing to the American people with a few gaffes here and there. There is no point. It would be a pointless ploy and they already impeached him. 

Election is in Nov. He still has my vote, but I don’t think Joe Biden would do it without the cameras around. They'd have to build a special tank to do that and probably put a no bid out to 10 subcontractors to build a special "crowd control" tank that cost a mere $10.2 million per. But he was an idiot to begin with and I think all those golden showers warped his brain. He is not able to form a regular though or apply any knowledge without lying. 

Trymp is worthless human trash. Send him to prison. It's literally on camera lol No but they're correct here. Honestly that's what Trump and the GOP want. China is not on our side. "Do what we did in 1989!" The fact that 43% would still vote for this dumpster fire is everything you need to know about republicans. The real story is "Despite all the sh\*t going on, a disturbing number of Americans want 4 more years of Trump." haha actually I guess I am fooling ya, because I'm YangGang bishhh Fortunately this is a pretty low risk activity -- outside with everyone wearing masks. Dude you aren’t fooling anyone Bunny? Can you point me to some resources where a rep or senator publicly called for his resignation. 

Genuinely want to compile these quotes. What about Police abuses during her tenure as Police Chief of Orlando? Decided to wait until now? Youre literally saying hes messed up for not going out in riots when the white house is being attacked do you know how ignorant that sounds. And to say he needs to be out there with protestors and just so bizarre out there i cant even comprehend your thought process. Again secret service tells him what he can and cant do based off safety levels and i highly doubt this would be even remotely safe or smart. You guys on reddit think your outrage should be appeased without using and inkling of a thought process. Go on with your day and stop finding everything to be pissed at the president about . After almost four years its gotten old as fuck If I had a dollar for every weekly op-ed I’ve seen written calling for his resignation... the Democrats impeached him, they did what they had the power to do. He’s not going to resign. We just need to vote him out. Look in the mirror, fellow citizen. 

I'm a left libertarian pissed off that Trump isn't an actual Republican.

I wanted Kasich in 2016 because I didn't want Hilary (please don't crucify me, friends).

If you're so blind that you don't see the overwhelming ignorance, race-baiting, arrogance, nepotism, hostility to science and the 4th estate (aka media), love for totalitarian governance, etc..........

I don't know what else to tell you. He's not a Republican. He's a Trumpist. It's that simple.

He's reincarnated Mussolini. Not Hitler. Mussolini. When have democrats ever called for resignation?

There is value in saying things out loud to the public. Messages are important. Bunker?! Holy Shit, Trump is the Puss! God im sick of redditors mindset that theyre always right and nothings ever enough. If he dies, whoever they replace him with will be more electable by default. Biden wrote the damn crime bill.  He's the architect of mass incarceration.  He gave the cops their tanks and grenade launchers. Don’t care. VOTE! I thought corona virus was bad, why is he outside getting close to people? Ooof.  Stop using fake news.  You are a fucking cockroach of this country.  Do better if you were fucking worm shit Yeah, that was a dumb thing to say, but it's not gonna move the needle. Just look at all the crazy shit Trump says. And Biden himself is know to have bad gaffes too, but he made it this far... Was there violence in Wilmington Delaware?  ...and he stopped it?  Is that what's this about? Because when you have been shouting into the void for over three years, continuing to shout or call for the same thing gets drowned out. The truth is IF Trump was ever going to resign he would have done it by now. He isn't Nixon and doesn't have a get out of jail free card and knows it. Relevance? Just because I am pointing out concerns with Bidens candidacy does not mean I wanted Bernie... Don’t get complacent, vote like Biden is a few points behind. Sad? Lord, get this person out of here and back into the kool-aid camp.

The president of the United States doesn't owe the protesters a thing!?

Gtfo.

And for the record I'm a conservative dem pushed more liberal in the last few years by the crony lover in chief. First cool Biden move I’ve seen in a while. Please keep them coming Biden, listen here. You're doing good. Things just night go your way in November if you don't fuck it up. Biden 2020 yall Of course they won't. In America, manliness is right next to gunliness. Take away people's guns and they just don't have an identity anymore. THIS is what infuriates me about conservatives; it goes beyond Trumps compulsion to undo every Obama accomplishment. This is the war for business free from any regulation at the expense of human health and lives. I’d like to think of myself as a moderate but this kind of shit just pushes me farther to the left And abolish private prisons and legalize drugs. ok We can worry about arguing about policy with anti-Trump Republicans later. Any help against Orange Cheeto is welcomed with the state of the republic at stake. I don't bother debating magats.  Why would I bother debating Marxists?  Say something relevant or gtfo. "If you got a problem figuring out if you're for me or Trump, you ain't black." Nice. Has nothing to do with the topic 

No matter who the president is. Democrats or other republican they would still be in a safe No. Just. NO. Once HE starts showing the office the respect it deserves, so will we. The only silly comment here is yours. It’s genuinely hard to tell who’ll win. If Biden does pull it off, I think it’ll be a close one and Trump will certainly throw the biggest tantrum yet. Silly comment. No matter how bad a president he is he is still the president.  Of course they are going to have him go to a safe room when people have been violent protesting. Nope, that's fake news and you're a nasty woman And yet his death cult think he's the most alpha of men.

Biden wasn't hiding. yeah but if Biden wins theyll be endorsing the “sorry about Trump” GOP candidate in 2024 Nobody is voting for the Lincoln a Project. No, I'm all for hunting with rifles & shotguns. But you don't need more than 3 shots for game. If you miss after 3, its generally gone. Well when theres a lot of people life you who constantly talk shit and berate hes gotta assume. Plus he cant do most things if the secret service tells him he cant, common sense again He can’t address the largely peaceful protesters? He could address the nation instead of cowering like a child. Don't forget, these are still Republicans. They still want no safety nets and low taxes for the wealthy, they just want to do it while smiling and pretending to be compassionate like GW. Hmm i wonder why?? Maybe because hes the president and cant condone this... Joe grabs mic: "See? Now this here is why you boy.. you peopl... y'all N... aww fuck" What about malpractice insurance I think it would be tough to enforce from a practical standpoint if a lot of people of color don't want to be cops. This is what happens when the president of the United States is an attention wh*re. 

Nobody can be getting more screen time on TV than the president. It will be interesting to see who these people are coming from the outside. Trump seemed so confident and exited about ‘MAGA’ getting involved. I do like coffee. How about "every officer has a body cam *that they can't turn off*"? Do you really think this sub is going to be critical of democrats for being blatantly racist and for supporting the systems of oppression that have led up to this moment?? Let’s not forget that BLM happened under Obama and Biden. Ah yes, Karl Marx was a famous right winger.

'Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary' -Karl Marx Daaaamn I love the Lincoln Project ads. They don't hold back in the slightest. Wish Joe's team did a better job of showing him out and about in the community. I feel like I rarely ever see much of Joe day to day. It would project strength to see him more often. Isn't that the say guy who decides who deserves to be black? He had to find corn pop, make sure he’s ok He already isn't healthy anyways You don't appear to know what hindsight is If Joe Biden is in any way honest about his concern, he needs to lead a march on the White House instead of visiting a place where something happened two days prior.

And he needs to clarify his racist positions from the past, and apologise for them.

If he does neither of these, he cannot be taken seriously.

He also needs to tell us what he will be doing to stop this kind of police violence -both the murders and the oppression that followed. He needs to speak up and stop mumbling into his sleeve. I will crawl across cinders and broken glass to vote down ballot democrat in November just to stick it to shit stains like this guy Let me know whether the courts accept this reasoning. Second amendment states the right to bear arms, not implicitly firearms. We should be allowed to carry swords and other martial weaponry. No. There are guns that require cocking/reloading/etc between shots. Think a lever action rifle. I am afraid is it going to take more than that.  Police culture is rotten to the core.  The whole mission of the justice system is going to need to change.  I can't understand why we have such a hard time getting a conviction against murderous police.  Our society needs an massive renewal. The entire police system in the country needs to be reformed from the ground up. These are all just band aids. I confess to a bit of schadenfreude watching Democrats trying to persuade themselves to support Biden. He's a horrible candidate, and if the D's can't come up with anyone better, they are toast. Or try to stop voting altogether.... Speaking of divisive... Doesn’t that mean all guns? Can't this mother fucker just die already? My fucking god. This is bizarre. Politically speaking, there is absolutely no way Biden could be seen refusing to take a picture with a young African-American person while visiting a police brutality protest.

I am sure this scenario was discussed before the final "go" decision to make the visit was made, and the visit was deemed worth the risk of contracting the virus.  If it wasn't, the alternative almost certainly wasn't to maintain a 6 foot bubble, it would have been to stay at home.

I'm not suggesting in any way that Joe didn't want to hang with these guys and take a picture with them.  He loves that kind of stuff.  He has a 40-plus year reputation in politics of being a guy who loves to get with the masses and shake some hands, slap some backs, and kiss some babies, hear their stories, and emphasize with their problems  He knew all the regulars on his train route home to Delaware each day during his years in the Senate by name and knew a lot of their families and other details about their lives just from chatting with him.

Honestly, I think he has probably really been having trouble being essentially confined to his home during this pandemic for that reason.  He felt a responsibility to provide a good example and be seen listening to and following the advice of the scientists and the doctors, though.  That was where he needed to be at that moment in history.

History is moving at lightning speed, however, and the protest was where he needed to be today.  He brought his mask, but strict social distancing in that sort of situation is tough for anyone, and impossible if you're running for President of the United States.

I feel you, though. I wouldn't be out there in any sort of mass gathering right now.  I get nervous about the possibility of accidentally coming closer than six feet to someone while walking my dog, or the minimal contact I need to make to pick up essential supplies (From my car).

Joe Biden is a brave guy, and has a special vocation right now.

I remember reading some inside stuff about recent Popes and they know their physical security precautions against individuals who mean them harm is not sufficient from a security point of view.  One Pope got tackled by some random person with a grudge as he was proceeding into Christmas Eve Mass during the opening hymn two years in a row.  That could have easily been much worse.  But they feel their vocations require them to take the risk.

Now, when and if he becomes President, there is going to be a different calculus surrounding Biden's decisions, and I think if something like this happened during his administration and it coincided with a pandemic, he'd probably be addressing the nation from the Oval Office and meeting with key protesters and police figures at the White House, where they would be tested for the virus, have their tempetures taken prior to entry, and have infrared cameras monitoring their body heat.

A challenger for the Presidency who is his party's presumptive nominee doesn't have the ability to or the luxury of taking those precautions at a big moment like this, though.  It's a tough position to be in, balancing the need to model good health concious behavior for the nation and the need to show support for the African-American community during an important time, but we should be glad he is willing to make the tough choices and hope he gets through the campaign without contracting the virus.  He won't do stupid things like Trump probably will be before the end of this and holding rallies in front of thousands of tens of thousands of people, but there will be moments where he is going to still have to be certain places and interact with the public in smaller groups like this. I don't envy him.

The times and Biden's age certainly argue for a Vice-Presidential running-mate like Elizabeth Warren who could step in and be ready to be President on day 1 if called upon. Maybe I'm still drunk but I read that as Joe Budden Yes also maybe Ellison will make some sort of public statement. The fact that the current racial makeup of the police doesn't match their communities goes against the equal opportunity laws. If everyone was presented truly equal opportunities, wouldn't the racial makeup of the force match their jurisdiction? Let's figure out a way to mobilize people to the polls in November. I'm thinking of volunteering in minority neighborhoods in swing states, Like OFA did in 2012. Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Cleveland, etc. DM me is an organization already exists or we can make one. Wow! Joe Biden (presidential) is out on the streets talking to AMERICANS while tweety trump is hiding in little bunker. Need new leadership & FAST! Here we go. Instead of paying attention to the reasons behind the protests we make it all about Trump. This isn't just racism here though racism is almost always part of it. This is sociopathy -  police taking an aggressive and abusive stance. Even if a person committed a crime,  there should be no abusive physical or verbal assaults on them if they are not resisting arrest.  Police who intend to abuse their position to threaten, harass and intimidate anyone they interact with should not be in law enforcement. You would have to be an idiot to buy that excuse. He has said its safe to go back even? Loo So you are implying that nothing good came out of dumping $1.4M (in today's dollars) worth of tea in a Boston Harbor some 240+ years ago? Did he actually say that lol Yea, this was all on purpose.  They're convincing their gullible voters that COVID is no big deal, meanwhile the rest of us know it's bad, so they're trying to make it so only the stupid gullible people will want to vote and they can win.

They don't care if they have to literally kill people to do it. Bernie voted for same bill Ellison should also charge Chauvin and his thugs with the negligent homicide of anyone who dies from the coronavirus due to the protests. This is surprisingly good! Voting is an essential activity. This is huge.  The county prosecutor was a police union hack, and would be cleared the four officers if he could have gotten away with it.  And by the way, one of the reforms that should be pushed for is to ban all law enforcement unions. > You know what would help is to somehow get guns out of our lives.

Good luck with repealing (or violating) the Second Amendment. You'll need it. Why dont he use those "most ominous weapons" then? Or perhaps is he waiting for them to start looting the white house before shooting them? Welp, guess he isnt going to do anything other than retweet "a good democrat is a dead democrat" Honestly the officer shouldnt be charged. He was doing the right thing. They are a very unpredictable race. Exactly, by it's nature it goes against the equal opportunity laws I think he will be better because he tracks pretty closely with the democratic establishment (maybe like the 30th percentile in the party in terms of liberalness, where AOC would be like 95, Kamala Harris maybe 60, Warren maybe 80, Joe Manchin maybe 5) . But the democratic party has gotten more liberal, so so has he. 

That's still a bit of a low bar and not the kind of leadership and vision I think we need in the 21st century. I also don't think Biden is particularly likeable or inspiring, but part of that is because he's old and I'm young and it's an identity thing. 

I just don't really appreciate all this posting that's like "oh look at the sage wisdom of Joe Biden". Reminds me a bit about what Andrew Yang was and is supporting. Shame he didn't get nominated. The rat helmet awaits. I agree with your last paragraph entirely!

Didn't Joe Biden helped create this BlackLivesMatter crisis by repeatedly supporting the War on Drugs which targeted minority communities making them the primary targets for policing and thus racism?

He has totally changed his tune in the past 10 years but why should we expect him to lead any different how then he voted for so many years ?

https://www.ontheissues.org/2020/Joe_Biden_Drugs.htm No, but I think if we fire every cop whose been caught flashing white power signs directed at minorities we'll be off to a good start. Even if it wasn't, Trumps fat ass would not be out there. Doug Jones voted against the amendment that would prevent the FBI from accessing people's browser history without a warrant. 

Unforgivable. I wish Yang's policy of required BJJ belts as part of training was taken more seriously and implemented here as well. Whenever I see Biden, all I can think of is how in the world does he deal with the relentless death of a loved one in his life? The third rail is thinking about death. How does he get out of bed each day? He seems like a joker, but he's hiding some real pain. Omg, please stay at least 6 feet away from him! He needs to stay healthy. Because the White House was under attack. So are we just going to fire white cops if the diversity doesn’t reach the status quota? So he's worried about his safety, as per the article, but "had no intrest" in even attempting a national address. No, he decided to stoke the fire more by effing tweeting garbage.....and surrounding himself with a mini army. He intends to kill people tomorrow....I know it like I've never known anything in my life. Go home for now everyone please, a terrified bully with others to do his bidding bodes badly for anyone in his path. This issue will not fade away and will be addressed, but we all have to live to see that.

Ghost them, let them be the ones overreacting to empty streets. Am I the only one who just love Joe Biden. Down to earth, doesn’t put on airs. Rode fucking Amtrak back-and-forth to Delaware for decades. Will be such a big breath of fresh air for our country. Long may he live and prosper and us along with him. You’re full of crap.

You present no facts when you are smearing him.

That’s not a “critique”.

Not sure who told you otherwise.

The party didn’t “coalesce” around Biden. He won.

He beat Bernie and everyone else.

He leads in polling.

He is from PA which is critical to win.

He is two time VP under one of the most popular presidents in Democrat history.


What information do you have otherwise?


At no point did Biden say these failures were new to the trump era.



You’re a liar and acting in bad faith.


What is your experience with elections and candidates that you know better? I'm just making a factual observation. It is a perfectly fine opinion to vote for him and not like him. And the fact that him and his supporters act like critiques of their record and policies are personal insults to them and act all hurt is honestly just pathetic. 

There's still no evidence he's the strongest candidate. His polling went up as the democratic party coalesced around him. It probably would've for anyone else who might reasonably have won. 

I think Biden will probably win. But I worry how he'll fair when Trump is gone, because he's acting like these societal failures are this new thing in the Trump era. Not in the conclusion at the end Oops. Thanks for the correction, you're right and thanks for telling me nicely. Editing to correct now. > and their asses if they didn't

I would have thought the part above made it clear the *if* was to be interpreted as ***when***. You keep slamming Biden with every comment here

Biden is the nominee and yes strongest candidate to take on trump The way it’s worded is not what you imply. You want to say his people are responsible for the most deaths by terroristic acts rather than what the phrasing says “deaths of terrorists.” (Just in case you’re misrepresented through screenshots or something) Wouldn't hurt to raise the quality of the protesters too. They've got to get the looters and rioters out of their mix and are the only ones who can effectively do it and not give the police the excuse they're looking for.

George Floyd's death was powerful and at first was building a dialogue. Then the immediate looting completely set that back. Now the inhabitants of these neighborhoods want the guard and cops in there to stop it. 

And when you give that kind of authoritarianism permission to abuse the power they run with it and more people will get hurt. 

Basically there's more than one way to solve the immediate problems here. You said “if” and then proceeded to assert that as truth


So only fake news is you, son. This should help the situation Absent a revolution, Trump will be in office on Nov.3rd. Then we will revolt at the ballot box and throw him out of office. Soldiers on duty rarely interact with the general public in the way police do. Military training for civil and public servants is not only wasteful, it's insane. 

American streets only start looking like a battlefield when we treat them as such, that begun when PD's started arms races. Trump needs to be forcibly removed from office. This might help Biden win. Dear good please don't fuck things up But military soldiers don’t fire at Americans. They are both arms of the executive branch of government and they’re job is to do the executing of actions in order to protect our liberties I’m not apologizing for Trump, I’m saying it’s not as simple as “Trump broke America”.  Is he a blowhard who says dumb stuff on Twitter? Yes.  Is he doing things other presidents have done before? Yes, except he says the quiet part out loud.  America has been broken for a while, and both liberals and conservatives have contributed to it If the Secret Service took Trump to the bunker, it was the Secret Service's call, and their asses if they didn't.

To considerable extent, what the Secret Service does to protect POTUS is nondiscretionary. They take no chances by statute.

IOW, this wasn't up to Trump. So the title of this posting is actually fake news. Great job giving Trump and example of it. There it is. Trump apologist. Nice We can’t pick and choose when we enforce the law.  If we didn’t hold Clinton, Bush, and Obama to the standard of the law, we can’t start holding Trump to the standard of the law.  The presidency has been out of control since the 1920’s, with unchecked grasping for more power.  Has Trump committed crimes or unconstitutional acts? Probably.  But so did Bush and Obama, some of them worse. It depends on what you mean by "conservative".

If you believe that we should worry about the national debt and run as close to a balanced budget as we can, if you believe that we should encourage individual responsibility and facilitate individual choice, if you believe that we should promote democratic values and human rights abroad -- then, yes, there is room for kinship between this kind of conservatism and the reasonable part of America.

But if you support Trump in the full knowledge of what he is? Nothing but hostility and a desire to do every last thing I can to beat you and your candidates at the polls. Trumps prodding isn’t the problem. His crimes are. The modern conservative movement has decided that Trump can’t be investigated or charged with crimes. You self identified as a conservative. So yeah, the ideology you align yourself to is in opposition to core tenets of our system of government. This isn’t a policy debate. It’s not a matter or disagreeing about politics. It’s a disagreement about whether we are a nation of laws. The modern conservative movement is in opposition to America. As a self identified conservative you start from that deficit of trust, but I’m not so unreasonable to think that you couldn’t climb out of that hole. It’s improbable but not impossible. This IS the real test for re-opening the country. Going to be interesting in the next 20 or so days. As if the CDC and our health system needed this. Tragic. It's long past time to adopt the model other countries have, where most police aren't armed.

Most Romance languages have two words for the police. One means "the cops on the street" -- who don't carry firearms (and often no weapons). The other (often translated as "armed police" or "military police") are the equivalent of our SWAT teams: the people who only show up when they're anticipating actual trouble. They don't just carry pistols; they carry military rifles. These are the folks that Paris called out to guard synagogues during the anti-semitic nonsense there a few years ago.

But the average cop writing speeding tickets, in *almost all countries*, is unarmed.

Some of the cops might say "well, I don't feel safe without a gun!"

Well, then, fuck you and go find something else to do for a living. Once again the idiot does not have the authority. I would also add AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Talib to the cancer from my point of view.  They purposefully prod conservatives into a frenzy the way Trump does. You can be a small-l libertarian Democrat. I'm one.

Libertarianism has been warped into this weird "fuck you I've got mine" ideology by the Kochs and so on. And the Libertarian Party is something of a weird joke that cares more about guns than not having taxes. But ultimately it was originally about liberty -- same root as *liberal.* Libertarianism at its core is the belief that people can live their best lives when they have the freedom to make their own choices and the agency to put those choices into action.

And people don't have that much liberty when they're murdered by cops, when they're destitute, when they're hounded by the police, when they're unable to get a decent education, when they're unable to control their own bodies. Paying taxes is not much of an affront to my liberty compared to the benefits it brings to people (including me) who get medical care, decent schools, roads, parks, etc. The stuff we do with tax money mostly *enhances*, not represses, individuals' agency over their lives -- which is ultimately the goal of libertarianism.

While I have some differences with some strands of Democratic Party thought they're minor quibbles compared to the big picture: the Democrats want to use the government as a steward of the public trust to build nice things that support everyone's ability to choose their own path in life. The way you phrase your comment is part of the problem too.  I have to “prove myself” to get the benefit of the doubt?  Are you serious? That is so wrong, you don’t even know me and I have to prove to you that I am worthy of you giving me respect? If PETA was doing it you'd have advertisement in every flashy magazine about it.
Half naked of course. I have no problem having disagreements about the tax rate on the upper tax bracket, or how many F-35s we should procure, but the rift between the cult of trump and everyone else is severe. A large chunk believe in bullshit Q Anon conspiracy theories, and never question a single word from Trump’s mouth. Until the disinformation that conservatives have unleashed on their own base stops, they will continue to drag this country down. It’s the only language the police understand. Don’t be sad. They are learning that murder is unacceptable. Most liberals/Democrats would be fine with voter  ID too so long as that proposal comes with a means to provide everyone eligible with an ID. Unfortunately, that's never on the table... Just a new version of a Jim Crow law. Mitch McConnell, Bill Barr, and Donald Trump are cancer on the republic social media or not. Training them like soldiers, even if trained well, is a problem.   Soldiering and policing are very different skill sets. No there is no kinship left. I’d argue that any chance of reconciliation died when republicans questioned the legitimacy of Obama’s citizenship. That was the point Republicans revealed themselves to be anti-American. 

The deal was sealed when Republicans protected Trump over country. 

If you’re a conservative that rejects Modern Republican politics, maybe. But you’d need to make a compelling case for why you should get the benefit of the doubt. I agree. The tool itself is neutral. But the very worst of us have poisoned it. I’m not really a “Trump Republican”, I don’t hate the man, but he doesn’t meet the important standard of me being able to tell my kids he’s a role model.  And I do feel like the republican part has taken a dangerous, populist turn.  But on the flip side, I also feel like the Democratic part has as well- there seems to be increasing radicalization on the left as well, and it is frightening to me that we are getting so far apart that we may have fascist vs communist elections soon.   As for the voting suppression, I do agree with things like voter ID, I feel like there needs to be a balance between secure elections and open elections. I agree, part of me feels like the development of social media has been a net negative.  In itself it is a neutral tool, but we have weaponized it and it is radicalizing us against each other Reddit isn’t the real world. There is a lot more kinship among American citizens, regardless of political affiliation, in real life. There are also many republican and liberal politicians and public servants who work together for a common goal day in day out. The media is largely at fault for covering fringe groups and crazy stuff. Social media is not the real world. German here. Can you folks over the pond please ask yourselves exactly this question OP has and stop hating each other like you were two nations at war? It's disturbing to watch the news and see American cities go up in flames. It makes me so sad. >Donald John Trump

I think you spelled "Jackass" wrong Overall there are very few bad police.But I don't understand how these particular officers can't be weeded out. Are other police osterisized for speaking out. I don't know. I think there’s plenty of liberals that would be willing to work toward common goals. It seems like liberals are interested in a vision of America that’s being actively destroyed by Trump, Republican politicians, and by movement conservatives though.

It’s one thing to disagree on a solution, it’s another thing to say because you disagree you plan to rip voting rights and voting power of those on the left from them, pack the courts with people that are completely driven by politics rather than the law (a Supreme Court opinion that ignores the actual text
Of a law...seriously!?!?) and has a significant number of rank and file people who think Putin’s Russia is better than an Obama or Biden America. Racial composition will never make it through the current court. I'm an older white man and I am with you 100%. Vote Democrat down-ballot put us back in charge of the government Joe Biden says we are fighting for the soul of America and that is absolutely true. lmao ok Go figure Mark Fuckerberg working with Faux news Fuckerbergs also saying Twitter is wrong for what they are doing by tagging the wannabe dictator Donald j drumpfs tweets that aren't true. I don't use Facebook and I wish other people would follow suit and hit that little piece of shit where it hurts the most and what he cares about the most money in his pocket and bank account. Mark Fuckerberg is an ass kissing moron that will be on whatever side is in charge so wait until Joe Biden and the Democrats take over the government and then you will see this robot moving idiot taking the side of the Democrats. But I have something to say to Mark Fuckerberg Democrats don't want you around you're a sell-out!! He should generally just stop talking it’d be better Haven't demonized the protesters at all.
The looters and people destroying property are not protesting. He’s a real hero. Very true, but the problem is that even at that level there is mass corruption and brutality. Police forces have a lot of influence in local politics. But the influence of the president of the United States is at a whole different level, and if the problem is so glaring then it is also a glaring problem that our current president would rather sign executive orders related to twitter censoring his calls to violence (as is their right as a private company, as well as it being in accordance with their own terms of services which bind voluntary users. It’s insane that the leader of the free world just isn’t doing shit to help, and is instead actively making corruption and violence worse. Where is the media and governors about social distancing now?  Haven't heard a thing or sense of urgency about the protestors causing infections. Sounds like the governor of Missouri is one dumb POS because if he thinks by telling Democrats if they don't feel safe not to vote then he has another thing coming. Because Democrats are getting out to vote whether they have to go vote in person or getting mail-in ballots and I understand Missouri has mail-in ballots so governor not only are you fucked but so is Donald j drumpf and every other Republican running in 2020 and that's because the blue Wave is coming again and Democrats are going to take over the government and get it back to the way it should be of, for, and by the people!! dumbass. Even though it is a national problem. 
Real solutions have to start in state by state, city by city, county by county Microwaves be snitchin! Yeah that’s never gonna happen with republicans owning the senate. They aren’t interested in doing anything that in any way makes the police the slightest bit uncomfortable. And people like you demonizing protesters aren’t helping either. Every single time things changed for the better they followed moments of extreme civil unrest. The American revolution, Civil War, the Civil rights riots isn’t he sixties, so on and so forth. Governments don’t listen to peaceful protests. Never have. Never will. You don’t have to protest but demonizing the people fed up with the injustice in this country isn’t helping either. Why’s rent you up in arms over the cops that are attacking protesters that are demonstrating peacefully? The reporters just there to bring up information on it are being attacked by the police too. Where’s your outrage? I also hate Democrat vs republican talk, and you’re right it isn’t a new trump thing, but he is doing absolutely nothing to help, he’s throwing fuel into the fire by doing shit like retweeting videos saying death to Democrats, it’s insane shit like that which make looters and rioters act violently, and normal people everywhere lose their minds. There isn’t anything to fucking talk about or debate, the issue is literally that murder is bad. That’s it. Just do the absolute bare fucking minimum and hold yourselves accountable for your murders. The simplest of demands, and until it is met the violence and riots will continue. And they will continue because peaceful protest is now PROVEN to not be effective at fighting these issues. The bottom line is that many more innocent people will die in the coming days and the destruction will continue, all while our “leader” makes it worse instead of doing the bare minimum. Somehow everyone complaining about legit gripes against Trump and his administration is never ever ever ever absolving him. while presenting points with out sourcing that claims to absolve him////while...lol...never absolving him He may not win his Senate election (not going to throw in the towel yet), but he's demonstrated integrity throughout. He is an Alabama Democrat and a credit to the state. You just listed off a bunch of shit about trump with poor spelling. How does Israel have anything to do with shitty nursing homes? 

I'm not absolving trump, I'm just saying this one specific issue is def not his fault. These places were always shitholes with infection issues. MRSA, VRE, TB, HEP C, scabies. You name it, I've seen a skilled nursing facility spread it. Ideally Trump would shut the fuck up until he goes to jail. To the folks in the right-wing subreddits, you are. So, I just want to say that lots of other people were saying that access to healthcare and action on climate change and racial justice and democracy and all these things are moral issues that speak to who we are as a nation before Trump came around. 

Biden is correct in this statement but it's also pretty obvious, and an easy thing to say when your whole party agrees with you. Kinda late for this now bah 😆 Mate. I don't really know. I don't walk in their shoes.
I live in a little country town where nothing happens. 
This isn't a Trump thing. Generations of governments have done nothing it seems. 
Mass peaceful intelligent protests for as long as it takes. Not just for a few weeks then everyone moves on. Maybe something like that. 
Not have the media just add fuel to the fire but constructively source answers .
Both government parties actually sitting down. 
No party reteric, I don't want to hear  republican and democrat talk. /s > Police officers are already required to wear a body cam

This is nowhere near universal. He's planning to run against a "good democrat" and I don't think anyone is prepared. umm hmm yeah PETA would have done it a month after the riots had ended and things were just starting to get a bit better.

Or done an online hit piece on GTA 6 for justifying police over reaction. 

While also funding the most racist cops of the lot and waving their hands and going. We can't do anything were really big you guys no seriously when they were asked by other activist groups to maybe consider not doing that.

Oh and when it was Martin Luther king jrs birthday calling him a racist for good measure. Pretty sure HRC said the same stuff, but nobody listened because her emails had boobs, or something.

And now we have Gorsuch and Kavanaugh! 

Who could have anticipated?

All I heard in 2016 is “they’re all the same”. I'm not sure what you're trying to say? I agree completely. Tell me what the hundreds of thousands who aren’t rioting should do though? Peaceful assembly’s, innocent bystanders, and those on their OWN property facing extreme police brutality (literal murder in many cases)? It has been absolutely proven that peaceful protests are not taken seriously and even denounced by our own leaders. Should the many innocent Americans simply roll over for the exact type of authoritarian regime their “leaders” would condemn? Seriously, what other option is there? tRumps a racist piece of 💩, it's all the asshat knows, prison 2020 will love the whole family 😆 John Oliver did a good piece on police "warrior training." That needs to cease also. The answer is not looting and property destruction. 
Those doing this have no interest in justice and solutions to these problems. Yes. Fuck PETA. Fuck the Atlanta mayor. Agreed. And this will be much easier when we start teaching every American from an early age the history behind the divide. A good start would be making required reading of:

The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America. 

This is deep in our culture. And while your recommendations are clearly necessary, it’s going to take more than just law enforcement reform to truly address it. You should hope that justice comes to MANY more than just George Floyd. Riots are exactly what happens when this shit is going on. Riots are exactly how this fucking country was founded. INNOCENT Americans are being MURDERED by the government. Do you seriously think Americans should just roll over like a bunch weaklings as the government murders with impunity? Seriously? And don’t say peaceful protests, because people who tried like Kapernick were all denounced and shit all over by the exact people who now think that violent protest isn’t the answer. Explain to me what the fuck the answer is then? And I hope justice comes for George Floyd. But all this property destruction and looting only takes the attention away from the problems. 
Nothing good can come from this. Antifa is a phantom organization. He's spraying gasoline on the flames. So, voter suppression. It's voter suppression. Thanks. He always makes matters worse. State-funded murder of completely innocent civilians and the the state-funded protection of those murderers is objectively worse in every way imaginable. Riots will continue. Americans want to fetishize the founding fathers and the revolution but some then fail to recognize the same mass injustices and corruption in front of their very eyes. Looters are bad but we need to realize the severity of things. Imagine if it was your innocent child who was brutally held down and murdered on camera by those sworn to defend them. Of course it won’t. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive for better. We don’t give up, just because it can’t be perfect. [check this out ](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/05/29/us_covid-19_death_toll_is_inflated.html) I dunno man, but I do recollect a saying about hindsight. Nice try, shitbrick. I would say it's working and the right people just might be the police. Exactly :-) more people would vote if it wasn't so difficult for them, and it's kind of hard to argue with a paper trail....
... Oh yes, this is exactly why they hate the vote-by-mail.....it's like team Trump is just super charging everything Republicans have been trying to accomplish for the last few decades.... Shocked! Absolutely shocked. Not sure what psych vetting occurs when somebody applies to be a cop. Did they serve one or more tours in Afghanistan or Iraq and see combat? Are there alt right/left social media posts.  So a psych evaluation with thorough background vetting. Should I assume those are standard for all applicants? The cop who murdered George Floyd has 18 conduct complaints with several reprimands and two shootings of suspects. He’s been described as tightly wound. How many more cops on the force with multiple violence complaints and a shooting or two?  Time for an outside agency to audit personnel files and clean house.  The Chief of Police has not done a good job of enforcing rules of conduct.
Frankly it may be time to do a national audit when Biden takes the reigns and a real AG heads Justice. The problem is not that they are trained like soldiers. It’s that they are trained poorly. Pretty much.  [Declaring antifa](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552) as a terrorist organization allows him to say anyone who opposes him in any way, shape, or form is a terrorist and must be dealt with accordingly.

Combined with [this retweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265855459719892993) of his saying "the only good democrat is a dead democrat" and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704) saying "when the looting starts, the shooting starts," I have to wonder if he's trying to get the right people worked up enough to start shooting up people who don't agree with Trump. Well said, Mr Booker.  VOTE BLUE. Trump as always is throwing gas on the fire. As with everything else if he could ever humble himself and apologize for the hurts and problems he’d do better but NOPE. He knows that if people can vote by mail, he'll lose, It's harder to disenfranchise people if they have options. Exactly my thoughts. Trump Administration Lifts Limits On Military Hardware--Then-President Barack Obama placed restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to local police in 2015 https://www.npr.org/2017/08/28/546743742/trump-administration-lifts-limits-on-military-hardware-for-police “Leadership: Whatever happens, you’re responsible. If it doesn’t happen, you’re responsible.” https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/398887965302091776?lang=en

Guess the protestors are right--Trump isnt responsible becuase he is illegitimate--The irony is him  claiming that Obama wasnt the rightful presideent when his projection may actually hint at him being undeservng of the white house You can protest peacefully. 
Nothing good is going to come from this property destruction and looting. Those involved in that should be ashamed of themselves. To put it politely. Plus, if you get a centralized record of discipline, then problem cops can't bounce from township to township. Well, just because there is a correlation between militarizing the police and greater use of violence by the police, doesn’t mean we should do the easy thing and demilitarize them.  I just follow the person we nominated, for some reason, in condemning the riots.  /s It wasn't as vocal, maybe. It's existed and been common knowledge for decades. It's been huge part in the way police operated going back to prohibition,  at least. A government official actually said that-- on camera Neither is the meat packing industry This is sick bruh Someone saw the poll that only had Biden back by 4 in Missouri and it starting to get worried. yes Trump has ocupied the White House for 3 years---he knew the pademic was o its way in november 2019, which was when he warned Israel, He set those ppe supplies that are needed to China in Februaury,  i could cotinue to go down a check list, but why bother when i could just refer to one of his tweets, Becuase there is at least one for everything


Donald J. Trump on Twitter | Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible. If it doesn't happen, you're responsible. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/398887965302091776 I'm watching this looting and property being destroyed on tv right now and when law enforcement  eventually comes in to put a stop too this . I really hope they all get a massive beat down. I will feel no sympathy for them. 
They are all pieces of shit. Nothing to do with the protests just taking advantage of the situation. 
Shameful. i will do that thanks good idea I dunno man, for a virus with a 99.985% recovery rate don’t you think it was a major overreaction? We need to demilitarize *everyone*. Start with banning semi-automatic guns. Do you think that why he is digging his heels in about vote by mail? What's so disturbing is that people like Trump and his Attorney General want to classify their political opponents as "terrorists" and eliminate or bypass and Constitutional protections that would prevent law enforcement from going after them just because  of their views...... I ever get a sense that a politician doesn’t want the people to vote or is working to keep them from voting, that politician is dead to me. Party and other policies don’t matter. If you aren’t on board with democracy you deserve no power in America This situation is bad ....but Trump is just making it worse ... Maybe he is thinking that by inflaming the situation further, it will get worse before it gets better, helping him to lock up the "law and order " angry old white people vote? So wait you think if you just shoot the first cops who show up then that's kind of the end of it? The rest of the cops like respect your big gun and go on their merry way? Yep.  Some asshole wearing a Hawaiian shirt trying to bomb a hospital in protest of the stay ay home orders a few months ago was killed in a shootout, so right-wing dumbbells picked up on it.  They were was a group of them in Minneapolis yesterday. You can just say republican at this point Hawaiian shirts are a sign of white supremacy now? Uh oh... Please stop spreading false information. What are you talking about? You’re not going to win a gun battle with the cops. If we didn’t have so many guns in the USA we all would be safer and then we could demilitarize the police. Sure, but they aren't having the fun of murdering their fellow countrymen without fear of reprisal or consequence. Just look at Laura Ingram, Candace Owens, Tomi Lahren, & Charlie Kirk's twitter feeds. 

It's all about property rights, they're demonizing the protests, when it's turning out that agent provocateurs are mainly the ones starting these riots. Huh. I did not realize that - had to look it up. But let's be honest, shall we? My ignorance of the origin of the thin blue line does not change the facts surrounding how it's used today. It was not as prevalent in the last 40 years until BLM showed up. There is evidence of the rise of one in response to the other and since then is seen as a political statement. So stop getting defensive; you're on the wrong side of this. Coronavirus is already doing that! To hurt and kill as many Americans as possible. But they are not going to win so what the hell is the point? That civil war the Right has wanted for decades. Make it an environment they cannot thrive in then, by training, by regulation, by enforcing the same standards the public is held to....make it systemically impossible for them to be a part of. That is a possibility with anything and everything. But we can't do nothing because of that fear. This an area where there is less possibility than most any other issue of that happening. It has a specific amendment preventing it from happening. Police are wage earners. The police state is the problem. The political ideology is the problem...not wage earners. 

There is a fundamental insanity built-in to our class hierarchy. That is the same as saying there is a fundamental insanity built-in to our political ideology.

We can't separate the political ideology we use today from the ideology that framed colonial period slavery. The position of the police is the same....and the fact that there are black police doesn't change the structure of the system. 

Liberals don't talk about these aspects...but they should...because we can't fix problems without getting to the root of the system, and the interconnection between issues. 

We can't deal with racism without dealing with wealth-inequality. We can't deal with wealth-inequality without dealing with racism. 

All of our social ills are connected in deeper contexts than is projected by 'spun' political narratives.

Why the fuck would US cops be murdering black men wholesale in the 21st century? 

Racism is accepted because authoritarian power is accepted. Authoritarian power is accepted because extreme wealth-inequality is accepted.

C'mon people lets raise the game. It existed for YEARS before BLM stop talking out your ass. Half of those things on that list are already in place. Police officers are already required to wear a body cam and cannot impead its vision. As a right of the people a person already has a right to an attorney if they cannot afford one regardless of status, etc etc. I never said I didn’t agree with better gun checks or control of them. I understand that because of the power a weapon holds. But you have to get a conspiratorial to understand that this is the beginning of a slippery slope if abused.

First no violent offenders (understandable) then no one with a history of mental illness (okay), then no non-violent drug offenders. (questionable) Then no one who has been arrested ever. (what?) Then no one in certain areas (urban). Then eventually systematically taken away the right through bureaucracy.

I know it sounds nutty. But seeing how the landscape has changed. I can see how in 50 years it’s be practically impossible to own a firearm by legal means.

Maybe I’m just learned to never trust anyone except yourself.

It’s weird because I agree with control checks, but then I see how they lead to the right being taken away indirectly. > Is it that simple? 

Yes. In a 2018 article which discussed figures from the year prior, so I'm presuming that means the 2017 figures, America had 458 deaths to police shootings compared to zero in Japan and the UK. What the hell is happening with us? I want to preface this with the fact I absolutely support the movement and any community that is subjected to this type of treatment, it’s horrible and inhumane the way the black community has been treated. It’s sad that I have to say that because the reality of the issues isn’t something people want to acknowledge.  

But we also know the statistics show crime is also more prevalent within the black community which leads to more interactions with the police. That directly correlates to the interactions the black community has with police officers. 

Then you could dive a little deeper and find out what kind of police officers they are sending to high crime areas, and it’s typically not the veteran law enforcement officers. There are so many things at play, and I don’t think it’s fair to leave anything out when we evaluate it as a whole.

I’m a huge believer in factual information, if we’re going to be showing statistics, I think it’s important to show all relevant statistics, good or bad. It’s not as simple once you break things down and show trends. I told my microwave. Just tell your Alexa/Google/Siri - it's listening. See you in room 101. He's basically just labelled all liberals as terrorists and fair game for domestic surveillance. Mine while his very fine people and proud white boys have been responsible for the majority of terrorist deaths since 9/11 and be does nothing. They are his people and he loves them. Co conspirators in the death of a nation. Couldn’t be the white supremacist groups posting their calls to arms all over social media, or congregating with their silly outfits on (like Hawaiian shirts) and long guns on nice shady, grassy knolls, waiting for dark. Is it that simple? Is it the cops are evil? Or is it that the police force attracts power hungry authoritarian figures who will likely tend to abuse their power? I’ve got a friend whose a cop, good guy. Used to be a stoner actually, but a lot of his buddies are real type A assholes. It’s just the type of people being a cop attracts for the wrong reasons.

Knowing you can’t realistically control the hiring process of cops to limit this. You still don’t want the choice to defend yourself against these people?

Why? There used to be a time when the last part of that statement wouldn't be controversial in the US. We can debate the line to be drawn all day. I may be a little to the left of your idea where it is to be drawn. That is how the discussion begins. Not where it ends. But the starting point is not that unreasonable. I would give up one or two of these points to see the others enacted. Me too, I wonder if we should call the FBI and tell ‘em to come get us. > The idea "Shouldn't we arm our selves against the police we hire?" is a really insane idea. 

If you have to arm yourselves against the police, then they're not police anymore but tyrants. How about just not having cops that shoot at, kill, or harm innocent civilians? Radical concept, I know. Okay but I’m trying to transcend society on this point. Nothing about society is concrete. It’s a flowing changing idea. But when we go back to the tribal days you reference. Those who controlled the “spears” I’m sure we’re trusted to defend the tribe. Until it was abused, like power tends to do to people. Only way to make sure no one in the tribe was being abused was to make sure everyone in the tribe has access to a spear. I agree on all those points but the military style auto control. I understand these may have been used to commit crimes. But if figures of authority can only carry them, then your handgun is as good as a knife.

When the cops fire upon you the property you’re legally standing on and own. You tell me you shouldn’t have the right to an automatic weapon like the cops who fired upon your house do. My estimation of  The Verge just went up significantly. Very well said, sir/madam. None of that sounds like the characteristics of a rational modern culture. 

That's a bad way to frame our problems. The USA is not supposed-to resemble a tribal war in the 21st century. 

The idea "Shouldn't we arm our selves against the police we hire?" is a really insane idea. 

I think we'll need to redefine or well-define our concept of society. 

Lets get that back on track. Once again, no one is trying to take your guns away.  A nationwide registration, closing gun show loopholes, banning military-style automatic weapons with more than 30 bullet cartridges, keeping guns out of the hands of repeat felons and mentally unstable people, is not banning guns. "I'm left" he says while espousing nothing but rightwing talking points.

Sure thing bud. Those are the two running. The primary is over. The people spoke during the primaries and chose Joe. You're welcome to not like the choice, but they are the only ones that can be elected. You have to choose - whether you like it or not. And make no mistake - if your vote would be against Trump, but you refuse to vote just because his opponent doesn't do it for you, then you *are* withholding a vote from Biden that he will need to win. If others do the same as you, it could be enough for Trump to beat Biden. And if that happens, that's on you. Unfortunately Trump has defined ANTIFA as “whoever is doing this.” Then how are we “playing right into his hands”? o.0 And riots need to be controlled This post is about Trump, not Biden. That commenter was called a nut for trying to equate the two. There's several universes and dimensions between what is known about Trump and what is rumored about Biden. With Trump there's several warehouses worth of video, audio, court testimony, transcripts and legal documents, proving his mistakes, wrongdoing, lies and illegal acts and behaviours. There's literally none of that with Biden. And trying to equate the two may not make you a nut, but it does make you dishonest and disingenuous. And of course they shouldn't. I'm just pointing out how this will be used. There exists a world in which a person can hate trump and also not really be stoked about Biden when there were a whole slew of better options for Democratic nominee. Besides, with the crazy times we are seeing we should absolutely not sit here and accept Biden as the nominee, we as a people can and should still demand better. This is not a call for more trump, it is a call for better than trump AND better than Biden. Nobody is going to stop protesting murder just because Fox finds a way to insult them. I will wear that title as a badge of honor and continue to fight against fascism and those who give them comfort (Trump). Yeah now it has become a divisive thing. The president has doubled down on it by not wanting to be seen wearing a mask (during a pandemic). He sets the tone for his base.

So now you have conservatives walking around without masks angry at those who are. It’s like “hey I’m walking around so it’s a HOAX!” Nevermind IF they caught it, they would just hush up and use the same ventilators and resources that we all have to use. They are just putting themselves at a greater risk to catch it. Yes, according to Trump, you are! I just want to point out that antifa is a movement not an organization. So Trump wants to criminalize the anti-fascism movement while fascism is on the rise. I am a proud ant-fascist but I am not in any way connected to any antifa groups. Am I now a terrorist? Ha ha. Of course he coulda said use a mail ballot if you don’t feel comfortable going out in crowds.  But he didn’t, because he’s a GOP keep Americans from voting kind of guy. Agreed. But this is what will happen. Trump isn't some mastermind playing 4D chess. He's literally just an idiot. The problem is... Who "fired" first and what are the differences we're talking about here? You have officers with tear gas, pepper spray, bullets of every kind, pepper balls, tazers, full riot and combat gear, some have mail-spec gear and... citizens, especially those who planned a peaceful protest, have very little.

Yes, they must defend themselves, but a lot of what is being done is not defense. It is control. Problems in this country are not going to  be fixed by focusing on one level, but have to be approached from multiple levels: presidential, federal, state, county, city and ultimately, individually. So focusing on the problems of cities ignores the roles/responsibilities of the levels of government (and individuals) above and below that tier. The fact that he and all his kissass idiots are trying to declare that Antifa groups are responsible for the destruction is downright hilarious.  There’s a bigger chance of PETA doing it. Exactly. Way too many times they rush into conflict and shoot first, often against unarmed folks, because they were afraid. Or so they claim. If they had 1/10th the training and discipline the vast majority of the armed forces had we would almost never have such problems. And if we did it would be a big deal - until of course the president comes along subverts justice and gives a free pass and a job to the worst of them. Playing into his hands is being quiet. 

A riot is the language of the unheard. 

The statement: **"No justice, no peace"**, is not a statement of intention, but an explanation of what happens when there is no justice. 

**Justice first...then peace.**

That's not my opinion....it's a natural law of justice. Oh for sure. True. Never-the-less, this is what is going to happen. Mark my words. You’re giving him way, way too much credit for thinking there is a rhyme or reason to his callous stupidity. Supervillains can’t help but to reveal their evil plans. If you’re in Missouri, remember to vote for Nicole Galloway to replace this fool! The economy will not be fixed by November. He's fucked and they all know it. I’m not one to engage with those who hold vastly different opinions but I found this interesting site:

https://ballotpedia.org/Party_affiliation_of_the_mayors_of_the_100_largest_cities

The argument that Republican mayors have less problems can easily be refuted with crime statistics. But most republican supporters don’t allow facts to get in the way of their beliefs.

EDIT to add: old article but refutes this conservative and Trumpian talking point

https://www.thetrace.org/2016/11/homicide-rates-spike-major-cities-democrat-republican-mayors/ Saying it also happens to whites is rhetorical BS.  African Americans are being murdered or beaten every day.  We only see a few of these atrocities thanks to the proliferation of video camera.

Take a look at this page.: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/)

Taking a look at the numbers; 23% of the killing is blacks even though they make up only 13-14% of the population.  If you subtract out "unknown" the killing of blacks killed rises to 29% !

The numbers are clear.  The thousands and thousands of videos showing cops killing unarmed blacks is also perfectly clear (though millions of Americans seem to ignore them). The cops have been hunting our African-American brothers and sisters for far too long and it has to end now. The synagogue shooter was taken alive.

Cops have no excuse to be playing executioner with people in the streets. He’s right.  Cops are trained like soldiers.  It starts there. Cuomo, Whitmer, wolf, & Newsom intentionally murdered hundreds of people by intentionally exposing them to a deadly pathogen. This can in no way be attributed to trump. These 4 are guilty of murder. 1st degree if i am not mistaken. Anytime a politician tells you “not to vote”, you most definitely must “go out and vote”!! I agree. You know what would help is to somehow get guns out of our lives. One reason for all their armor is that it’s so dangerous out there when everyone is armed. Then hire lots more women and people of color. That would take Federal oversight. Way too many bad cops, and other professionals none from city to city and then state to state managing to leave their bad records behind. But yeah the idea that some pissant town with a few thousand people could create and run their own police force well is ridiculous. Especially when they are usually turned into profit centers to harass and raise funds for city coffers vs. protect and serve.

But Federal oversight only works as well as the mostly self serving blowhards in charge do their job. And I'm sure someone would find a way to say it is unconstitutional to have the Federal government stopping our local cops executing folks on the street. 

But ideal we'd have boots on the ground monitoring every arrest until such time cities can prove their cops have reformed and aren't as much of the problem as the criminals. 

And FFS in this day and age is there really no technological solution that can be used to restrain someone quickly and safely?  Other countries (not all) manage to train their cops to deal with and restrain folks even those armed with a knife. The map has really opened up for the Democrats, but I think it's wildly optimistic to think Kansas is truly in play.  It's encouraging that there is even a conversation, but for Kansas to flip would require a blue tsunami. 

Personally, I think Colorado, Maine, Arizona, both Georgia seats and North Carolina are more than in play, but winnable.    A rising blue tide could push Doug Jones over the top in Alabama and possibly unseat Mitch McConnell in Kentucky.  I love what I see from current polling and  I would love to see Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, Joni Ernst, Lindsey Graham, Cory Gardner and  Martha McSally  all kicked to the curb.   But I'm realistic - there is still 6 months until the election and a lot could change between now and then.  Trump is proven very resilient and his base have an amazing ability to forget his douchebaggery and incompetence, and I'm convinced they love his racism. So let’s vote them out - good call! If respect for the truth was an option, I'd take it. But Joe Biden is known liar. His only saving grace is that he looks great compared to Trump. Yes. Thank goodness. Agree 💯 percent. I agree, I think it's a similar problem with prisons, some things just should not be made privatized/for profit because someone will always take cut costs to profit.  Washington needs to realize Wall St. is not America, the people are America. 

I think, and I"m just guessing, that most of those "medical career" training commercials on TV is about the level of education some of these workers have.  It can't pay very well, so the bottom of the rung places aren't looking for the best, they're looking just for anyone to fill the job.

So many factors contribute, lowering of education in America, bias against the elderly, greed, etc.  

Only way this would get fixed if if the congressional leaders who don't care had to live in those same conditions.  I'd love to see how Trump and McConell would deal with being poor and living in a low tier elderly care home. If their health is at danger, I think it’s perfectly fine they are firing rubber bullets. People are overreacting saying it’s unlawful and things like that when their lives are more in danger now then ever. It happens disproportionately to black men. All the whataboutism in the world doesn't change that fact. FWIW, hundreds of officers have been injured by rioters including 30 in NYC, 15 in Philly and 15 in Richland SC.  Many remain hospitalized.  

Also the office that “rammed The death of an innocent black men is wrong but do you think this ever happens to white people?  There will always be bad cops that abuse their power through the country and the world,  but when a white person or non-black person is mistreated or killed by a police officer it does not make the national news nor cause riots and looting. I've heard there is a place. Galt's Gulch... LOL. Ah yes, the point said loud and clear. Dont vote. I'll win that way. Like the Parkland cops that hid while kids and teachers were being murdered. There are plenty of countries where the society behaves with civility. How about a state licensing board? Like nurses. Hear me out... every town and county has it's own PD, this decentralized structure means that you could have the most progressive highly educated police, practicing modern community policing, de-escalation etc. in one town and in the next town over a gang of jack booted thugs. 

Holistic reform needs a solution that can span this decentralized structure. What federal or state law would be required to implement this? Utopia will prob never exist This should be made into a campaign ad - long before coronavirus he weakened regulations and stopped enforcing those that remained - while soliciting donations from the private care home industry.  Then after COVID-19, he treated senior citizens as disposable. He cheats at golf, he cheats on his wives, he cheats his way out of military service, he cheats his contractors and sub-contractors, he cheats at elections. This.

That "thin blue line" shit is a direct response to the Black Live Matter movement. It only showed up shortly after the Black Live Matter movement began. They say it means that police officers keep our society from descending into chaos, but what they really mean is that police officers are justified in what they do, even if it results in the death of an innocent black man. Yea they think they're all Seal team 6 and citizens are all Osama. Because the right is just as paranoid as DJT. They literally treat him as a god-anything positive that happens, Trump did it. Anything negative? It’s a deep state conspiracy perpetrated by Democrats to destroy him. They can’t believe that he’s done anything wrong, ever. Everything he says, no matter how bad, is excused away as “sarcasm” or “4D chess.” Everything bad that happens is Soros trying to bring him down. Get rid of that festering gash in November and good policy will return very quickly. Obama’s legacy carries that label not simply because of his honourable name, but because the various regulations were good policies that saved lives or saved the environment. Get rid of the fever blister and his ruinations can be mended. It’s long past fucking time to take the military gear off these chucklefucks who LARP as infantrymen. For my family members, this is 100% true. They were very vocal that they voted for Trump because he pissed off the liberals the most, so he must be good. Literally anything that pisses of liberals in their mind is good.

I have an uncle who is posting memes making fun of masks several times a day who also got pissed off that family members won't make him free masks. There's a ton of checks and balances needed right now everywhere, starting with a return to common civility in our society by both law enforcement and citizens. 

There's just been too much rage tolerated for too long.  It does absolutely no good: It doesn't matter if it is a store clerk being attacked or a person passing a bad $20 bill, there is no reason for the abuse of another human being during a simple and normal societal process. 

A person going to jail has every right to be treated with full human rights. And a server in the food industry has a right to work without being screamed at. And people make mistakes, even when they're driving, road rage needs to be addressed with a loss of driving privileges, just zero tolerance for abuse in all forms. Enough of this 'going balistic' crap. This also happens when leaders direct infected patients to be sent to nursing homes to recover. Most do have an aptitude test. The problem is law enforcement wont put you on the street if you score well. But we just got rid of checks and balances on the executive branch.  Why would we start adding them back on now?

/s Profits over people. Trump spins it into being a freedom issue when everyone with a brain knows we have no actual freedom in the usa. Like you can spend your whole life paying off a house and miss a tax payment and get it taken away from you. But suddenly wearing a mask becomes controversial Why do I have the feeling that we are only one step away from Trump trying to convince us he has tied Kim Jong Il’s 38 under par golf score? What's new...when anyone submits an article about Trump also submit a link where people can check their voter status aptitude test***
intense background check
extensive non-family reference check

atleast the military has training Law enforcement, government corruption, lobbying, military spending, senators that refuse to bring bills for a vote and do their job, election interference, president that spends tax payer cash at own businesses and takes holidays more than actually working... 

Lots of room for checks and balances! Big businesses will come out of this a lot better than small businesses A friend of mine's father passed a week ago from "pneumonia"...aka COVID. The whole family was there, pictures and all...today several family members are sick with COVID...oh and BTW, no one tested the father for COVID...and yes, the family had several trump supporters...so sad. I think it started out as this- you legitimately probably could've safely reopened rural areas sooner if there had been an organized federal response of any kind. Then the president layered a bunch of culture war on it with #freeMichigan or whatever and it became solidified as a partisan issue Because they know it's real and coming for them because they're hypocrites, karma ! [https://www.nfg.org/news/breaking-ferguson-activists-meet-president-obama-demand-end-police-brutality-nationwide](https://www.nfg.org/news/breaking-ferguson-activists-meet-president-obama-demand-end-police-brutality-nationwide) Right now we are taking people with authoritative impulses and giving them carte blanche with high powered weapons and paramilitary training and then we stand back wondering why it's going to hell.

We need to raise the quality and caliber of the officers by offering much higher wages paired with requirements of psychology training, de-escalation and interpersonal skills.

We need to make the officers, police each other by holding accountable the individual officers who broke the laws but also the officers who ignored it and did nothing.  They can no longer be allowed to hide behind the thin blue line. Obama had a plan...until IMPOTUS destroyed it...[https://www.nfg.org/news/breaking-ferguson-activists-meet-president-obama-demand-end-police-brutality-nationwide](https://www.nfg.org/news/breaking-ferguson-activists-meet-president-obama-demand-end-police-brutality-nationwide) So? The fuck is a regular cop doing trying to handle an active shooter? Lots of good replies here but this is the one I believe. Once words escape Trumps mouth they become canon for FOX news. Their sole job is to provide backup for that madman. So dude is blasting away school children with a direct injection AR15 with nitrous, cop tells the dude put the boomstick down, dude doesnt, cop shoots, cop fired because they did their civil duty wrong? Joe Biden for President!!  Joebiden.com  Bring back dignity  to the White House, prosperity for the average American, and respect for the truth! What is the oranges of this?  Oranges....oranges...hahahaha

Nice to watch Trump having a stroke on TV. The best real answer I’ve heard:

In democratic areas, you generally live in a populated city, and closer neighbors. Covid has hit your area with deaths as well as economic layoffs. So you see that it’s real firsthand. 

In some rural (red) areas they have the layoffs but haven’t seen the death from cases. So to them, it’s all made up bullshit and they want to get back to work. 

Best reason I have heard. Makes sense on some level. If you kill a person, doesn't matter what was going on, instantly off the Force and barred from being hired again by law enforcement.

Any and all deaths by cop are investigated by DJ officials from out of the jurisdiction where it happened.

All trials against killer cops happen in the jurisdiction the victim lived in. They'll all bid against themselves essentially and end up making things more expensive and no better because of bureaucracy.

Just Trump's attempt to look sciencey. Trump's incompetence us PATHETIC If you take almost any situation and ask "what's the worst possible response" you will arrive at the conservative response.  The only exception is "what will make the rich richer" at which they excel. He's shown just how despicable the GOP is. Reread my comment. Just saying that left is bending reality even more than right on this particular issue. He thinks his possessions define him.  so yup.

He is the poster child for materialism.  Empty vessel trying to fill his soul with stuff, an addict. He's got that in common with Mrs. Turner. Yes, places where lots of people live are generally run by Democratic officials. Please feel free to copy and paste this whenever you see someone on Reddit say “both parties are the same”. This misinformation needs to be curtailed. You're not supposed to say the secret plan out loud. Trump logic. 

Trump controls everything and is amazing. 

If the virus is out of control that means that trump didn't control it and he failed. 

Clearly that can't be true. Selfishness is core to their philosophy, and they can't be bothered to make sacrifices for other people. But the leaders in a majority of the places where the riots are taking place are democrats...? Then end ALL mail in ballots. Every one. 

Conservaties want to keep them for their voters whi generallyy vote more by mail in. Nope. Grandma trump voter has to come out to covid town then if the gop demands it. republicans have always been the political side of big business. if big business is losing $, then we have to put the people back to work, even if we lose some. BUT- they wont be putting their family in harms way......just you and your family. You think the right isn’t bending reality? They elected someone who lies so often Twitter had to mark him as an unreliable source. Being conservative involves a great degree of believing in conspiratorial horse shit.  They will make it up where there is none in order to further their idiotic agendas.  “I’m immune to this virus because it does not exist, it’s just the flu.” Definitely agree. But I feel compelled to note that Cuomo & Murphy both implemented policies that forced nursing homes to accept covid19 patients to lessen the burden on hospitals. The regulations that were removed by Trump would’ve  helped with this but it shouldn’t have been a surprise that nursing homes weren’t equipped or prepared to deal with it which sadly resulted in a lot of deaths at these facilities. Yes.  He. Did. I'm not gonna disagree that trump basically went down the Obama checklist and has attempted to undo everything he did accomplish.


However, I work in EMS and those facilities the article is talking about where not taking the proper precautions anyways. Even during Obama.


A lot of these places are cesspools of filth and neglect. No masks on covid positive patients, no proper isolation gear when dealing with those patients, no isolation ward for those patients. I could rent for hours about these facilities. 

Trump deserves a lot of blame for how hes handled this crisis, but honestly this one is not his fault. In Phoenix 4 People arrested with ties to White Supremacy group, all persons were from out of state. I think /u/wwabc got it right, but the other thing is the health of the economy. It’s Trump’s greatest asset for re-election, and we Republicans admit it that his odds are hinged on it. 

Yeah, Trump might be a racist, but at least the economy is good. 

Yeah, Trump keeps pushing bad trade deals, but at least the economy is good. 

Yeah, Trump might have to be talked out of bombing other countries, but how’s your 401k? 

A lockdown will (has) decimate the economy, and harm Trump’s chances of reelection along with it. Opening the country back up should theoretically mitigate that, at least for the short term. 

That’s the conservative MO: deal with things for the short term, shrug shoulders when shit hits the fan years down the road To be fair since have dropped the facade and would just scream "white power". If Twitter enforced its policies from the beginning, we would not be in this mess. Anybody else notice wherever articles about alt-right posing as leftists come up, there are a bunch of comments defending the alt-right and deflecting?  

I've seen this even on center left subreddits. He never said that.

His comments are being taken out of context.

He was being sarcastic. 

Comments that Trump supporters use to defend him. Salon articles are unhelpful. I believe it, but find better sources and quit propping up a total rag publication. Simply.
The masked believe and accept the advise of medical experts 

And the masked-nots would rather listen to non-medical experts. Because medical experts are out to hurt Trump.. In order to undo the damage by Trump's policies. We need to keep electing a Democrat president for the 20 years. I considered myself Republican once. But once I realized that they were never for the working class I became a Democrat. What do you expect from an android that doesn't have an emotion chip. I bet that he praised police brutality in a private conversation with Stephen Miller, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. Many of them think playing 12 hours of Call of Duty equals military service. Seems someone said "what do you have to lose?". 

I think we all know, now If it is any consolation, just think how bad things would have gone if he and his staff had a greater level of competetance It’s a publicity stunt at best. And a disaster for NASA, the non-militarized space force. But maybe that was half the intent. Trump will only add fuel to the fire. That a true leaders listens to the experts and not anti-science groups. This is a great answer. Ty for the response I appreciate it. Type of responses from Trump supporters:

He didn't mean it.

He was being sarcastic. Indeed I am absolutely not a trump supporter but this is actually fake news. There were no changes nursing facilities are still required to have an infection control person. This article also fails to remind there is scope and severity when tagging/citing facilities and it has been that way for years before trump took office. There is a lot that you can blame trump for but this article is a lie. By dragging his feet on the birth cert, Obama opened the door to Trump as a national political figure  


We can do this all day because it's a situation where their philosophy that 'you don't need government, the free market will fix all' fails hard.  Same for environmentalism.  Sometimes you need a good government to provide solutions, and they have worked their whole lives to dismantle it. Because they're fucked up in the way their minds work >Everything Trump touches, dies. 

I wish he’d touch himself a bit more. They have to own the liberals no matter the cost. It's "what aboutism" pure and simple. "Yeah but what about ..." simply says you cannot address the issue at hand. There are subs here that have discussed Biden's behavior, but to respond to a clear outlining of trump obviously deranged and ramaging behavior just means you're ok with it. Well maybe we could get him to touch these riots. Just like that secretary he allegedly murdered You're right. We're all fucking nasty animals. Irrational violence is in our nature. War is not "smart" or "legal." But, time and time again thought the pages of human history, it is only the raw, emotional, rage, death, and smoldering hellscape hangover of such chaos which inspires us to ask ourselves... How did we let our differences get to this point? How can we avoid such terror in the future? But these lessons are short remembered. Where were you April 29th, 1992?

Violence should never be the answer. But, we animals needed to fight The Great War to try and end all wars. Obviously it didn't, because we're dumb fucking animals. 

Realize for a moment how desperate, sad, scary this must be for everyone and stop gaslighting. Mcdonalds..? What kind of Civil War? One that stops criminals from burning down cities? So it wasn't democrat governors who either

1) let covid positive people go into nursing homes (and beat on the elderly in there)

or 

2) Forcing nursing homes to take back their covid possible residents instead of taking them to a hospital

You pieces of shit killed grandma, you have blood on your hands if you support this cruel, disgusting party Trump and the GOP. Let’s not forget the co-signers of corruption! Joe is our next president. Joe is a bumbling fool You're too smart for Reddit Too bad he can’t reach his dick. And his golf courses It does sound like this industry is not very ethical.  The article points to hiring new or maybe even illegal immigrants as part of the problem.

"In recent years, the industry beefed up its profits by exploiting low wage workers, primarily of color, who were often recent immigrants." I thought this was common knowledge.  Why are you defending China?

https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/03/wuhan-coronavirus-coverup-lies-chinese-officials-xi-jinping/ King mierdas I believe NickJolter was referring to Bidens habit of touching people inappropriately.

Democrat officials say it's just how Biden is. They claim he expresses himself through closeness, touching and whispers of encouragement.


Since it's a sore subject on this platform its up to you to search the web for Bidens inappropriateness. Don't ignore the realities of the people we may elect. Obama bad; deregulation good! That's *fewer* Trump votes not less Trump votes, Mr. Bloodthirsty. Keeping Dan Patrick in power. Fun fact, by Republican logic, 1) we should call him Dan Goeb like how they called Beto Robert cause "that's his real name" and 2) we should make fun of him for just being a radio host like how AOC is constantly called a bartender because what she did before being elected defines her Yeah, Biden and Trump are *exactly* alike🙄

Stop playing with your home lobotomy kit, ya nut. Show me evidence that they were not. Yes. He just can't comprehend the pain of others. Wrong. Misleading premise its really shows what a little person trump is. Do you need a new TV? Got to be honest... nursing homes have always been a disaster. It isn’t just 1 thing. It’s a bunch of things. Everything Biden touches is conveniently ignored and not throughly investigated Yes. That's how it appears to me. He's uhactually bragged about it. 


Just Google it.

The President Is Winning His War on American Institutions


https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/04/how-to-destroy-a-government/606793/ I've seen it happen in my own life.


Personally effected by his careless removal of anything having to do with President Obama. 


As if by doing so, he can erase President Obama or his legacy.


It's sad, pathetic, and shows he does not care. lmfao what? "there are more important things than living" Yes, I too hate it when the uppity folks behave all animalistic! Why can't they peacefully protest by taking a knee or something??? Yeah! Check out all the white supremacist with this business owner! https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1266931911445880833?s=19 A slap on the damn wrist if you asked me 40 arrests of what number? Are all shops looted by white supremacists? Has anyone actually looked at the videos? Why political parties in US are such a echo chamber. I checked out the right side subreddits and even they do not bend reality like Democrats. I thought that people aligned with a party are usually blind in my county but us takes a candle. Go and read a little of what is WHO role in regardsto  all diseases in the world ...its not just covid 19 I feel like this is more the perfrct storm combo of modern-day conservatives systematically gutting gov't-sponsored STEM programs/departments in favor of military spending and corporate/wealthy tax breaks, forcing NASA to look to private sources of income and sponsorship among the more eccentric billionaires who directly benefit from aforementioned conservative fiscal policies. No, it’s accurate

This has been discussed for years


You are just invested in your myth Joe will really have his work cut out for him come January. Found the guy who didn’t lose a parent or grandparent this spring. That's your incorrect opinion. 
This conversation is going nowhere. 
So stay safe out there. For how bad it is now it could get worse. It would help to not have such divisive people in power. Anyways, this has become normal in America and it’s why people have had it Obviously you know nothing about the Louisville incident. 
Stay safe. so less boomer trump votes in November, freeing up real estate, and reducing population/carbon footprint... its natural selection, do not impede What aspect are we focusing on here - there's a lot to consider when you think of how bad everything is:

The economy? Farmers? Unemployment? Miners? Manufacturing? Infrastructure? Healthcare? Education? National debt? Environment? Race relations? Policing? Social Media? Which is the real Obamagate. 

All the good that Obama did, which then Drumpf tried to close down. I'll add this to a long, long list of "shit Trump did wrong during the covind-19 pandemic that are costing American lives. " I'm open to the space force stuff as being a potential good.

My hope there is in the long run this could reduce red tape and budget conflicts. When everything is under the USAF banner the in atmosphere stuff is competing for funding with the out of atmosphere stuff.

That could totally backfire too... USAF needs satellite launches for X,Y,Z but the USSF didn't budget for the USAF's requested launch. Or even worse possibility... "What do we need NASA for? Space ops is handled by the military now, and everything entertainment or communications based is just a public service... And no, you can't see our global atmospheric measurements they're top secret" and you've opened the door to killing NASA and our best tools for global climate tracking.


Ok on second thought, that might be a neutral at best decision That kind of certainty requires much more evidence than a poor campaign strategy. Making a fraction of the US population suddenly turn against their own people is a pretty difficult thing to do. Organizing such a movement on the fly would be next to impossible. The only way I can see such a situation being possible is if the US military submits to his command. Even then, however, timely aid from foreign allies could stop that. Even if he manages to become the dictator, what then? What would drive him to overthrow the US? I don't like Trump but baselessly accusing him of trying to become dictator is going too far. YOU ARE NOT WRONG

Welcome to the right side of history and welcome to sensible America. Republicans aren't happy unless people are dying Protesters don’t listen to people like this.

The celebrities are needed to start to cool people off. Wait..... hold up..... so are you possibly suggesting that trump just gets rid of Obama stuff for no fucking reason and he probably doesn’t even look at the thing he’s getting rid of????? Noooooooooo He couldnt even do Stormy correctly

Stormy Daniels claims Donald Trump lasted 'two minutes' in bed https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-news-stormy-daniels-donald-trump-two-minutes-20180828-story.html The cops are in on it too, fuck the police, and hang the Nazis What has Trump dine correctly? Is there anything? There are always black block anarchists who go to just create chaos. Thank you for being honest 

Stay Safe No, you’re right. I retract my statement. That’s a whole bunch of hyperbole Covefe 19, hang tRump Explains the guy in the gas mask No, you poor brainwashed idiot

Trump dismantled the pandemic plan and didn’t give shit until the markets started tanking

More Americans are dead because of it

Fuck your stupid numbers games 

What is wrong with you miserable inbred losers? You are broken inside. As for corona deaths here is a tiny list. Italy has about a 5th of the population of America but has a 3rd of the deaths (33k deaths). Spain has around a 7th of the population of America but they have 27k deaths by corona little less than 1/3 of the deaths in America. The UK has a little less than a 5th if America’s population but 38k deaths (little over 1/3 of America) America definitely isn’t doing the best with the virus but don’t act like we are way behind every other country Trump only cares about himself. It should be a record landslide but two things make me nervous 1. Biden isn't a slam dunk 2. Most Americans are dumb as rocks. Is that a serious question? Do you understand how flat-out dumb Palin is? Not only is she an idiot, but she also doesn’t do politics very well. She’s also a terrible orator and has minimal knowledge of current events. Knowing this, let’s see, how many people are on this planet? About 8 billion. So yes, I can actually think of about 7,999,999,999 people who can’t be compared to a Palin pick. Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren, to be specific in name, are both well beyond highly qualified for the office of VP. Yeah, we will probably get a better picture after the "fog clears" if you will.

They wil have to look into the past of those arrested to find out for sure, and thats not always easy or quick. Surprise surprise If you want u can tell me what he has exactly done wrong but I would say that giving America the best economy ever before corona was a good accomplishment. Hopefully in the next 4 years he can not only have the economy recover from corona but get it close to where it was pre corona. Also to me one of the biggest highlights of his presidency is that there are 10,000 more factories in America than Election Day 2016 Regarding VP, [it's actually pretty ambiguous](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/former-president-becomes-vice-president/) due to the language of the 22nd Amendment. The amendment mentions that they can't be *elected* more than twice, but doesn't say anything about them being ascended to the presidency. In theory, VP Obama could become president again should something happen to Biden, but wouldn't be able to run for his own term. 

Of course, we don't know how accurate this is because the situation has never presented itself. It would likely take a SCOTUS case, and that can all be avoided by simply picking someone else as VP instead. And you actually included a propaganda link?


Poor idiot No you poor deluded trumpie


Everything trump touches dies



He’s dogshit Trump admin in a nutshell "trump undid all Obama's good policies and a lot of people got hurt and died." This. he touched over 100k people? TRUTH. And another truth is that I SWEAR TO GHERRD I’MMA CUT EVERYONE IF YA DON’T TAKE YOUR LAZY ASSES TO THE POLLS IN NOVEMBER. I don’t care how much you think it doesn’t matter. FUCKING. VOTE. Been waiting for this trump tower moment Did trump not say days ago that we needed increased police and NG presence in big cities? He knew this was going to happen and because nobody listened to him the protest were hijacked by people who just want to loot and riot. The economy is tanking because of a virus (not really his fault) and unless the rioting continues should start picking up within the next month. 


As for other policies you might want to read about [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-biggest-accomplishments-and-failures-heading-into-2020-2019-12) that one list accomplishments and failures

[this one](https://www.promiseskept.com/timeline/) is a more biased source but has a more day to day operation of Trumps administration. 

The biggest problem with Trump is his rhetoric and he has a big mouth. But while he says stupid things he does somehow get things done Trump is a racist you poor idiot


Birther scum



He tweeted a video saying the only good democrat is a dead democrat


The country is burning and the economy is tanking 


You are here on your knees licking his boots about his policies


Wow “his actual policies are good”


You went full stupid Obama is ineligible to be VP and as much as I like him putting him in power again would be a violation of norms and precedent on transfer of power dating back to George Washington. I would like to know who this guy is--

Questions raised over masked white man with umbrella seen calmly smashing windows before Minneapolis riots---Speculation that figure dubbed 'Umbrella Man' may have been an agent provocateur https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/minneapolis-protest-riot-umbrella-man-george-floyd-a9539741.html Protesting is justified. Rioting is not justified at all.

Rioting is violent, illegal conduct that damages people's bodily integrity and property. It's "understandable", but not "justified". It's nasty, animalistic behavior that must be stopped. It is a very likely scenario IMO.  I consider it FAR more likely than the article does, with a 90% chance if/when Trump loses.  Trump has always been a dictator restrained so far by others, and he is not an idiot by any means. She's not even mad though she's just trying to get into the spot light now that black lives matter and black justice has become the headlines again. This situation makes Amy and Harris look like tough VP picks because of their history and justice records, 

SOOOoo Demings is seeing a VP opportunity, and she's not wrong, her odds have increased greatly imho and talking shit to Trump is a great way to get on MSNBC and get back into the spotlight TRUMP downplayed the severity of covid19 in Cih-Nah, pariased Xi - this in spite of intelligence telling him in Novemeber it was bad over there and would spread. US intelligence told allies like Israel China was lying.

If Trump wanted to help Taiwan he could use US influence to include them instead of taking the USA's marbles and going home

This move further isolates the US at a time we need as much good will and allies as possible cooperating in creating treatments and sharing those treatments fairly - instead trump ruins our relations every chance he gets and tried to buy up one company's vaccine in development wanting an exclusive. And considering how they handed out National Stockpile supplies with more going to states that voted for Trump vs states that did not, and how federal aid for coronavirus gave millions per sick person to states like Alaska while it gave around 40,000 per sick person to NY showed it wasn't based on need... My ridiculous dream is for Biden to nominate Obama for SCOTUS Justice. The only senator in the line of succession is president pro tempore, so he’s not ineligible for the senate nor the house of reps, just potentially ineligible for being president pro tempore or speaker of the house. Can we give all black voters 2 votes instead of 1? He loves gold but has the anti-King Midas touch “Some of the 40 arrests” . I’d like to know the actual number, Obama is ineligible to be VP and potentially ineligible to even be a Senator because that could put him in direct chain of succession. Why is anyone waiting for him to do anything right? He's been a complete failure his whole life and we're still waiting for him to be great? Move the hell on and start installing the change we need!!! There is no more time for a fractured Democrat party. Green new deal, healthcare, education, minimum wage, criminal justice reform. Now is the time for overhaul and we have to get mean about it. We are way too damn close to fascism. He wasn't going to get much of the Black vote, but I think that most other minorities will see themselves in his "Thug" remark. So he's lost more of the Mexican-American and Asian-American vote.

And although I don't there are many "compassionate conservatives" left, losing those could contribute to Trump losing in more battleground states.

Plus polls are also showing that Trump is starting to lose seniors as his bungled efforts against the pandemic show his incompetent he and his administration is.

So all he was doing was dog-whistling to his rabid bigoted base, but he won't expand that nor increase their enthusiasm.

All in all, a losing proposition for him IMHO. It does nothing to help Taiwan's interests by pulling out of WHO. It doesn't even help American interests. All it does is bravado, and to show to the rest of the world trump is a whiny SOB. All it does is giving up a seat at the table for no real good benefit or reason.

Okay America pulls out of WHO. Now what? What's trump's next move? What will be *your next move?* You're gonna form a new WHO? With black jack and hookers? How are you going to make others join you? You have a plan to form a coalition? How will you approach this then? You think trump thought that *far?*

This is how children think and handle difficult, complex, multilayered situations. There is no plan, no strategy, no logic, just pure "I don't wanna!!!" Adults should know better. It is so easy to say stuff and do the destructive thing but every time this happens, no one has a plan to do anything else in the aftermath.

Just children in adult bodies. That article is showing how governor newsom is going to cut the budget.  But there is likely federal funding coming to keep that from happening.  

It was an interesting article, but let's not jump to conclusions that the testing is being restricted. Thank you for posting this. Minnesota Officials Link Arrested Looters to White Supremacist Groups

They don't have to.  State and local governments have passively obeyed their every whim and legitimized their every crime for three goddamn years.  *Watched* an open Russian spy take over and destroy US institutions while parroting the surreal words "administration" and "presidency."

Suddenly they're going to lead?  Please.  They'll file lawsuits, Trump's kangaroo courts will rule that 2 + 2 = 5, and they'll say "Woe is me, I guess there's nothing to be done.  Better luck next time!" https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-30/school-leaders-demand-help-on-testing-tracing-for-campuses-to-reopen > Far-right Extremists

Russpublicans. Obama has been proven. 
Can you name one person that couldn’t be compared to a “Palen pick?” It just sounds like too much of a conspiracy theory for me.  If I want to be tested I could.  The tests and test locations are readily available. Thanks Obama. She wants to get rid of him as badly as we do. They are not doing the testing and tracking needed to contain the virus.  They are merely offering testing to people with systems.  This is why we had another 23,000 new cases today.  

He's also discouraged masks, which would stem the spread of the virus very quickly if fully adopted. No, it doesn't.  China was hit first and so the WHO went there to investigate.  China mapped the viral genome, enabling the WHO to begin the race for a treatment and a vaccine.

If the virus had started in India or Romania, the same scenarios would have played out, only they might not have mapped the genome as quickly as China. Petty concerns when the race to get a vaccine is so urgent.  Play your political game when people are dying of a plague. Another Trump tantrum.  We need to be working with the WHO to stop the spread of the Pandemic and find a treatment and a vaccine. Doubtful.  The regime's martial law plans are proceeding right on schedule.

With all the Russian hacking, propaganda, media control, and court subversion, there wasn't going to be an election anyway.  This looks like they're too sadistic to even allow the impression of one. >If there aren't consequences for murderous cops and feckless government, then people have to create consequences.

Such as internet rage? It does seem like the WHO is in with China and is not looking out for our best interests.  I think it is the right move too. I hope Obama is a part of the administration but I really think Biden needs to go with a woman for VP.

Edit: for VP Pulling out of the WHO is the correct move imo. They ignore Taiwanese sovereignty/ignore questions. They definitely downplayed china's role. Honestly this might get me down voted but i would love to hear other opinions so im posting anyways. Same thing, son GFY, chud boy There is free testing near me.  Seems readily available to me also.  I am not sticking up for Trump...but let's not just make stuff up. Gee, I wonder if Trump threatening to shoot looters will effect the vote? Give up on him Nancy. He has never done the right thing as president, and he is never going to Even if it was hacked it's fair because Russia + gop hacked 2016 I was wondering if people who are purged from
voter rolls know they have been purged.  I imagine a lot of people think they are registered but are no longer. They should fear losing them all! [Trump was a NY democratic most of his adult life. He’s actually pretty center left on stuff like this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/grzvav/remember_this_the_next_time_you_complain_that/fs271ns)

And 

[Trump barely qualifies as a republican, let alone a conservative.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/gsuc9p/if_the_republicans_lose_will_they_try_to_pass/fs7l0k0) If the Senate finally caves will it be a McConnell condoned mutiny or will it start as quiet conspiracies within the rank and file...like the plot to murder Hitler. It seems obvious to me that President Trump wants to suppress the reporting of the number of cases in the country because he feels it reflects on him.  That  is why he does not press for testing to be available. If testing for Corona virus were freely and widely available, the number of identified cases would jump by a factor of 10.  

The fact that his dereliction of duty has cost many thousands of American  lives means less than nothing him. Ok I just went back and looked at what he said. They first thing he said is that he had the governors back and was ready to deploy THE military (never said his) a little later after the riots he said that the mayor of Minneapolis better get his act together or he would send in the national guard. He received backpack for both comments and was told he was racist.. Now the same people are doing what he said to do a couple days ago They’ll get eaten up in New York. And if they go to Minneapolis, they’ll face the national Guard. Very soon Trump will be gone and Americans will once again be represented by the intelligent. Try as they might, the secret service cannot hope to stop them all. Donald John Trump has proven he is beyond any chance of rehabilitation so there is no other way to end this but with his destruction. No. There would be dead ‘looters’ and people mauled by ‘vicious dogs’ if Trump has his way.. And what policies? He has no policies but pissing people off. Every one of Trump’s policies has to be divisive. Putting one against another. This country will be torn to dystopia if Trump is not voted out. You lie. He said he has got HIS Army ready to move in. So basically red states are the new battleground states. We really have to fuck this up in order to lose huh The riots will eventually stop as its only May (about to be June). I think the key is mobilizing these frustrated people and register them to vote. This is a pretty big jump from "I don't understand Trump's campaign tactics" to "he must be planning to become the dictator". There's always the possibility that he's just an idiot. Saying that it's a nonzero chance doesn't make this excusable. You're insinuating that this is a fairly likely scenario since you thought it was worth bringing up. Trump said 2 days ago to have National Guard mobilized in big cities and was called racist for it. What do you want trump to do? If his advice would of been followed the riots would not be happening and it would just be peaceful protest.... Trump has a loud mouth but his actual policies are good https://bollierforkansas.com/issues/

Climate change, taxing the rich, abortion, protecting Medicare and social security, etc. He rose alright, by saying that the damage was all being done by “Antifa and left-wing radicals”. As if the idiot knows who is responsible. Like what? Forever She’s for a Democratic Senate Majority, which should be everyone’s priority right now. She’s no big P progressive, but she’s be a pretty reliable vote for most progressive issues I think. Not even close to the same thing. 
Do some research beyond the headline. It’s the same thing


Wake up Completely different set of circumstances. Didn’t it just happen last month when police raided the wrong home? Kansan here. Kobach lost because he wanted to continue Brownback’s failed tax experiment, which lost the state tons of money. Schools were hit the hardest as most of their funds dried up. I hope we can get a democratic senator. But don’t assume that just because we elected a democratic governor (AKA anti-Brownback’s policies) that it’ll be easy by any means to win the senate. Focus on what matters to the votes here: jobs, healthcare, education, and taxes. Avoid talking about abortion, guns, immigration, and Trump. We don’t need the perfect democratic candidate who’s going to automatically lose the race. Show me some evidence then of this happening regularly. Incorrect No Hopefully, he will have lost as well.  So what would they really be bailing from?  The minute he becomes a private citizen again, they will have all forgotten about him and act like they didn’t prop up a clown for 4 years. Does it happen consistently?? Pompeo the ultimate boot licker >We win because we have the better ideas.

bingo Yeah, that's been told to me too.  Oh, and progressives and liberals are the ones who suppress progress and equal rights... While I like that sentiment, it's been expressed about at least a hundred things so far, and the republican elite has responded by thinking his vileness just means they can be more openly vile too. He's gonna have to get appointed to some more meaningless board positions at this point, or actually get a job. I'm assuming she's still basically conservative and ethical...  If so, that's a good thing.  Some rational and ethical conservatives are necessary. How is it the norm What progressive policies is she for? WhTs the point of having a (D) elected office the votes/policy are basically the same. Don’t be paranoid. I looked back at my old comments and saw the thread. You do know it’s public, correct? Has nothing to do with an alt. Why did you respond a conversation you were not a part of if you are not using an alt?

You aren’t fooling anyone This is kind of like getting mad at your dog that they can't drive a car. time to rid america of him I want them to jump and still lose.... Never to rise again. Their whole ideology is a lie. Most US voters have the same dream. It's ridiculously easy to uninstall the Twitter app. He is fueling the crisis.  Riots and a social civil war just help with keeping people away from the ballot box. Obama and Biden need to hook up again for another 8 years. This dumpster fire clown show in charge needs to go the fuck away before America dies. I don’t have an alt? That’s childish. Whatever. This is a pointless conversation. All that matters at this point is respect and voting trump out. That's amazing.. link? How many buttery males? One issue is that Republicans have shifted to the crazy right on issues like NATO. 

In the 1970s, you might have been a Jerry Ford Republican. 

I personally preferred Jimmy Carter But was happy that both agreed on so many important things. 

Now, the Republicans try to destroy the Democrats for the abstract joy of doing so, even when that means trashing institutions (NATO) that the Republicans built. 

Maybe you could even go back to being a Republican and try to turn it back into a party that supports limits on the role of government, limits on government spending, and a preference for free markets, in a sane, moderate, kind way. 

But, right now, the only sane, patriotic thing to do is to vote for Democrats. Voting for a Republican today means supporting people who rip babies out of their moms’ arms, put children in concentration camps in the desert, break up NATO, promote Russian dominance, and spend hundreds of billions of dollars whenever that helps the people who bribe them. That stuff has nothing to do with being a Jerry Ford or Bob Dole Republican. 

So, anyway: I think the way to talk about this with your parents is to come at them from the traditional right on defense: “I can’t support someone who’s weakening NATO and handing control over the United Nations. I want a president who believes that America should be in charge.” I'm already seeing conservatives explain that Trump is really a Democrat. Did you respond with your alt by mistake, /u/ocalabull? Shhh...don't bring any attention to it.  Let them go farther right and nominate Kobach.  Give what were once liberal/progressive Kansas Republicans the final reason to leave their party.

Remember in the 80s when conservative (mainly Southern) Democrats became Republicans because the Democratic Party embraced civil rights fully?  It's payback time.  The Republican Party has embraced an extremist right agenda and it needs to be rejected outright by the remaining people with a moral center who once knew the party of Abraham Lincoln as progressive. What are you talking about? My candidate is Biden. You sound like you’re doing more dividing than a lot of others on here. Good So, more internet rage? Yea I know it sucks. I realized that last election and have stopped filling them out. That’s a relief (I think) All emails for surveys and petitions  of politicians and political causes are only a pretext to ask for donations. I highly doubt any of that information is ever even calculated, more less put to use. I think this state missed the 1960s realignment and kept voting on party lines. Hopefully this extremism gets people to finally realize and get back to their founding abolitionist roots, instead of going along with the GOP defending Confederate monuments. No. We can’t let them unperson him like they did GW. We have to new hammering them with him for the next decade or more. The vast majority of the right are cowardly bullies. They may show up with guns planning a race war but if anyone shoots back they'll piss themselves and run to the police for protection. Klobach lost the Governor's race in 2018.  He'd likely lose the Senate race in 2020. Same here in SE KS. Thank for you for fighting the good fight in KC! Over here in MO, need to find a campaign to volunteer with. I’m glad they are starting to call accelerationists for the extremists that they are. >These common sense legislation allow gun owners to be not be hassled by patchwork gun control.

I'm glad that you agree it is common sense to not hassle gun owners with patchwork regulation. But, Shaneen Allen was a victim of patchwork gun control measures. The protections of FOPA are inadequate today.



FOPA established a common standard for *transporting* firearms while engaged in interstate travel along the nation's interstate highways.  The laws in several states were less restrictive; the laws in some states were more restrictive.  States could continue to enforce their more-restrictive transportation laws against people who were not engaged in interstate travel. 

FOPA2 could establish a common standard for *carrying* firearms while engaged in interstate travel. A law that only applies to people using the highway system.  States could continue to enforce their own, stricter laws in the rest of their state; they simply wouldn't be able to enforce them against travelers passing through. 

>States will never do that because some states have less restrictive permits like do a 4 hour class vs some that require actual training.

Oh, some states require far less than 4 hours of class.  12 states have no licensing requirements whatsoever: Anyone who can lawfully possess a gun can carry it and conceal it.

But, for FOPA2, we wouldn't need to adopt this minimal, "Constitutional Carry" standard.  We could select the strictest standards from the 42 "Shall Issue" states, and adopt that as the requirement for "Highway Carry".  My current license would not be sufficient to meet this "Highway Carry" standard, but there would be nothing stopping me from taking the additional classes, range time, and other requirements and picking up a "Highway Carry" endorsement on my permit. 

>You keep saying that 10% like its meaningful.

I do. 

>Studies suggest, however, that only a fraction of Americans who conceal carry actually do so on a routine basis.

That *might* be true, but it is utterly irrelevant here. The nation's 20 million licensees don't need to actually carry a gun to **cast a ballot.** Well tbf Pay Roberts is retiring, so current events will definitely play a factor into who gets his seat. Barbera Boiller appears to be the presumptive Dem nom & the primary is 8/4/20. Putin directed cyber influence to stoke racism in the 2016 election. I therefore wouldn’t be surprised at Russian influence in all these riots. Governor of Minnesota said 80% of rioters in Minneapolis were from out of town.  Couple that with far right and it’s a recipe for destabilization, which Putin has bee in doing to all democracies in the world. You should come to the Kansas sub and post some stuff. There are a lot of Democrats and liberals and progressives there. Dr. Barbara Bollier! I currently work for her campaign and we've been really encouraged by the responses we've been receiving from Kansans and their rejection of the current Trump-GOP. Initially, the state saw this with the Kobach/Kelly gubernatorial race in 2018. 

Don't be fooled, Kansas is still fairly red but I think what has been proven the last couple years is that it is more "purple" than people once thought. As for the campaign, we've been doing everything we can to reach voters through digital platforms, etc. Please keep having hope! Go ahead and run pompeo, a dog catcher would destroy him. This one would hurt the GOP on a profound level. Kansas hasn't had a Democratic senator since 1938. The Democratic candidate now is a former Republican who flipped a few years back, so she has some conservative backers. I'm a kansan and I always say that Kansas really is more purple than people give us credit for, especially after the failed tax experiment that Brownback subjected us to. Our public schools are still desperately underfunded because of him. It hurts the mind just to think about it. ☹️ Trump loves the deflection from Covid, a President who takes the worst possible situation a death and uses it to hide his ineptness as a leader. Does  he help control the situation? No, he adds fuel to the fire by threatening U. S. Citizens ( when the looting starts, the shooting starts ) great words from the POTUS, and when someone gets shot  and killed, then complete chaos will follow, and trump, “ I take no responsibility at all “ I have to believe that after this week, the GOP leadership is looking very closely at the scales. If they abandon Trump, they alienate his cult; if they let him continue they run the risk of losing control of both Congress and the White House. Trump loves the deflection from Covid, a President who takes the worst possible situation a death and uses it to hide his ineptness as a leader. Does  he help control the situation? No, he adds fuel to the fire by threatening U. S. Citizens ( when the looting starts, the shooting starts ) great words from the POTUS, and when someone gets shot  and killed, then complete chaos will follow, and trump, “ I take no responsibility at all “ Kansas just elected a dem governor! They can do it again! Kobach is so radical that *Kansas* has rejected him time and time again. Lost a race for Congress, lost a race for Governor, about to lose a race for Senate. And I love it. And they'll blame it on COVID-19 and voter fraud because they can't see how much we're fed up with their shit over the few people that kiss their asses all the time. The proverbial they can't see the forest through all the trees. He could go burn down a building because that’s what some people are telling me is just Nope, they’ve had 5927194910 chances to do that. Losing Kansas won’t be the tipping point. I knew that meant he can’t block people but does it also mean he has to turn it over when he leaves office?

Because that would be amazing. Run. Up. The. Score.

We win when we mobilize. We win at the dinner tables. We win because we have the better ideas. Or lock arms more tightly in front of Trump to protect him as he refuses to leave office. These ghouls have lost all rights to govern anything. What a fucking shit show things are. Every time the GOP takes the wheel we end up in a ditch. For the sake of our democracy I hope that a year from now this is the case.

Sadly I find it much more likely that they will double down Barack Obama quote:

"If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better." There's a number of Senate seats in danger for the GOP, which is good for the country Haha oh yeah that’s right the whole fucking state is run by Democrats!  I forgot!  So why would I blame Trump?  He doesn’t have anything to do with Detroit, SF/Oakland, Baltimore, Chicago, etc being complete and utter shit holes. So youre against states right then?  These common sense legislation allow gun owners to be not be hassled by patchwork gun control.  States will never do that because some states have less restrictive permits like do a 4 hour class vs some that require actual training.   Sounds like this lady could have used more being ignorant of really the only law regarding interstate travel and guns. Why would i let someone with that little knowledge or training have a gun in another state?


 You keep saying that 10% like its meaningful. 

Studies suggest, however, that only a fraction of Americans who conceal carry actually do so on a routine basis.  Only 3 million carry every day—about 1.2 percent of the adult population.  So that more than 10% is just some bullshit number. That 1.2% is including states that dont require ccp so even lower than 1.2% of ccp owners. People get them so they dont have to pay for more background checks or have a waiting period.   So youre legislating for that 1%ers.  States already have a choice to accept another states license. Since they don't,  thats the states choice.  

If a federal one that comes into play which may not even be constitutional considering its not codified and normally those rights go to the states by default. It would have to be the strickest law available requiring classes every year for continuing education. Similar to law enforcement requirements.  

Youre talking injustices rectified. Women released from prison because of non threatening case in 45 days when the minimum was 3 years.  The true injustice is the states minimum sentencing laws. Not the gun requirement. If it was considered non threatening than a fine of $1000 or so would have been better.   Thats the true injustice. fler derf? Thought so.

Point proven. Make Kansas bleed again!! We seem to have followed similar paths. Growing up, my entire family was Republican (still are, of course.) As I got a little older I shifted more Libertarian. I framed it as "Republican ideas about money and the economy, but letting people live their lives as they see fit socially." As I rounded the corner on 30, I completed the full shift from card-carrying Republican to progressive Democrat. The key to it all was **empathy**.

It seems like you have discovered this, too. I am glad you did. Oh Klobuchar should def not be veep. She pulled from the same type of voter as Biden. They need to woo the progressive wing of the party to avoid 2016 repeat.  That wing happens to be tough and uncompromising. The centrists want to avoid losing their party to the real wing nuts like the Republicans did. I get it. But I also think you need to throw the progressives a bone considering they are 30-35% of the party, and are asking literally for the boot to be taken off the neck of the poor. Not unreasonable. Herr durr durr! Typical r/politics type.

You can't actually have a conversation.  You also cannot show any proof.

You can only use name calling and bullying to try and push the other person away in an attempt to hide your shortcomings.

I know I said this before but your method is not nearly as effective as you think.  

I would recommend trying to actually listen to people when they talk and have an open dialogue.

I know that is not something you will do as I have seen your post history.

Now insert your name calling and incoherent ranting. So big it fits republicans Yes, democrats are basically republicans.  Welcome. We can only hope

The fact that *Kansas* is in reach is a very good sign That guy doesn't care about *anything*.

Thanks for staying home in 2016, everyone! darn the luck I already told you where you lied you poor trumpie dirtbag lol I never said that. I'm saying it's not the norm. We need about 25,000 11 hour hearings The thing was, I had no idea to stand up against. I haven’t fully agreed with all of Klobuchar’s ideas. It’s unfortunate that this is the reason she’s becoming more unpopular, but either way I would have preferred a different VP. I think it’s pretty obvious that this was going to cause a stir anyways. Show me where I lied.

You are the troll.  I already reported your swearing and name calling.

Go back to r/politics where your harassment is accepted. you do understand that black people are not 25% of the population right? That's something that you can understand? Because using this statistic as if it somehow shows Black people are not killed disproportionately is ridiculous. Try again. You are here to smear other Democrats you aren’t fooling anyone

That type of privilege is what helped trump win the first time


Your candidate didn’t win, GTF over it and get rid of trump first


Stop wallowing in self-entitlement This is not the correct take.  And certainly not the way to welcome someone. If comments are removed instead of tagged or called out how does anyone know the difference? You don’t win hearts and minds this way. If your ideas can’t stand up to obvious bullshit how strong are they? You lied and accused people of advocating violence 


Each of your comments is being reported for harassment Welcome to the big tent! Perhaps you should go back to r/politics where your name calling is common place.

I am trying to have a civil conversation.  Why is it that you resort to name calling and deflect from the subject at hand?

How does name calling enhance your stance?

I think it actually has the opposite effect. Run along, trumpie dog 🐕 The Democratic Candidate, Barbara Bollier, has raised a ton of money so far and is backed by former Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. None of her GOP opponents have raised nearly that amount of money. There is no need for name calling.  Please be civil. The other commenter never advocated violence you dirtbag trumpie liar If Republicans lose this seat watch them bail on tRump like rats from a sinking ship. I was asking for the other commenter to stop advocating for violence.  

I am not sure how that means I support Trump. And many of the remainder would only pass it if it were conducted in Russian. I never was the type that follows Trump no matter what. He was always a terrible human. A lot of Trump supporters would fail a Turing test. So, this is what it took? Not the 3 yrs of lies (10k+?) Not the racism? Not the misogyny? The thousands of ethic violations? The emoluments violations? The nepotism? Not the Mueller Report? Not the obstruction? Not the impeachment? Not the sullying and staining of our constitution and office of the president? The sheer depth of ugliness and hatred and stupidity? What a great opinion.  Let's make this guy president for 8 years so he can have the power to do something about it.

&#x200B;

oh.

&#x200B;

I see. That’s not what you said though


Are you going to keep this charade up? If you haven't found them yet there are 50 count boxes of the style shown in the thumbnail available on Amazon for $30. With prime delivery they come in two days. They are one of the few items we've received on time since this started so they are a good bet. Search "masks for germ protection" and they are the first option. Good luck and thanks for doing your part! Stay safe and healthy internet stranger. I disagree with how situations were handled. I’m also disappointed. Am I not allowed that? They deserve to lose a lot more than that. Be aware that some of the Nazi incel spewage is Russian pot-stirring.  Though they obviously have a receptive audience. You didn’t “disagree” or jusr say you were “disappointed”.

So please don’t lie to squirm You don't need to pick a party. You just need to think for yourself. The republicans, or the vast majority of them, have gone crazy in their blind following of Trump. Resist! They did go on a lengthy diatribe about wanting to go there to shoot (black) looters. Those posts were left up. In tRumps ameriKa it is... Clearly "oppressive government" means "random citizens with signs."

Such a terrible foe must be defeated! Pity this couldn't have happened before the city burned. There is a 15 percent false negative... Yep. I can think of any great nation that so willfully chose collapse. I posted this in a far right sub that always talks about using their guns to fight against oppressive government and...
they immediately deleted it. >I have always been someone who fought for other people's rights. Never was one to blindly accept and politician. I just want freedom; I don't want to fear the government and I want them to take care of people when they need help.

Well you're absolutely not a republican. Something HAS to give. We often think of political belief in a 2 dimensional left-right sort of fashion. But it's much more complicated. Think of it in terms of multiple axis -- economics, world affairs, social justice, social freedoms, role of governments, and probably a few I'm missing. 

My point is even within the world view of "libertarian" , there are many places where we can still collaborate. Just for example you may still believe in keeping government out of economic life, but believe strongly in social justice and freedoms. We welcome you and your efforts in the fight to make this a better nation where we *all* have life and liberty! 

A key word on that sentence is effort. Whatever you feel over the next few months, please act-- get involved in campaigns as you can, vote and get others to vote. Acton can sooth anxiety.  

Cheers! I wish there was no one killed or murdered but to say it's the norm is a little to much. Sure there are racist  cops out there and I don't understand a racists logic at all.
Some stats I've read on police killings. 
Since 2015 there have been 4700 people killed by law enforcement with that being 2300 white 1200 black with Hispanic and other the remainder.
Still way to many. 
Keep safe. Did you see what my original comment was before that? It’s ok to disagree with a Democrat. I never once smeared anyone. I’m disappointed in Klobuchar. Is that not allowed? Flynn You’re asking me to speculate. You’d have have to ask them that, but i’d imagine so. A random civilian killing someone is quite different from a deemed justified police killing Wait one of the richest men on the world is pro big oil? That's soooo surprising! Then why does it keep fucking happening Would the same GJ decide differently if they didn't know the suspect was a police officer given the same set of relevant facts? I am so happy that you openly share your beliefs despite the fact that they clash with your family’s. 

I am also very glad that you stopped supporting a party that has become a symbol of cleptocracy, racism, and ignorance and lost the roots that made Lincoln its president. One day, GOP might become a Center-Right party that attracts more Americans. But today, it looks more like a party that Nero would’ve thrown while watching Rome burn. I don’t believe she said anything, as she absolutely shouldn’t have. That would be extremely unethical and unprofessional, as the grand jury decision is supposed to be impartial and based on evidence and nothing else. So as a Senator, her stated opinions on the matter might have carried some weight. What were her remarks on the record at that time? And if you would be kind enough to show me where I can order a 30 day supply of N95 masks, I'd be happy to wear them. r/joebiden come help us replace Trump in November! Having grown up in red Texas, I went through something similar years ago. My personal opinion on the healthiest way to view this epiphany you've had, isn't to realize you're a democrat - but to realize that right now, your values and worldview line up better with Democrats than Republicans. It means you're an empathetic person that believes in both personal freedom, and personal responsibility. In short, you're a good person. I think it's best to not think of those traits as tied to a party, so much as that there's one party that you're more aligned with than another.

I hope that doesn't sound like splitting hairs. I just think identifying as either a democrat or republican (or any other party) should he secondary to what kind of person you think you are. 

I really hope that made sense. r/joebiden come help us replace Trump in November! r/joebiden come help us replace Trump in November! r/joebiden /r/<joebiden> R/joebiden congrats and thanks for finally wising up. thats as nice as i can be at this point. Fuck you liberal scum Because he’s a fraud looking to make a “muh both sides!!” argument That "cowboy" is a city slicker with a charge account at a western wear shop. I don't even listen to anyone using terms like "liberal" or "progressive" unless they have published a fixed definition of the term and use it consistently. And you know this how?...😆 Yeah and the Clinton/Sanders ticket would have been unstoppable too, but politicians don't listen to my advice. Indeed ! We're going to have to wait it out. 2021 or possibly 2024. It's everyone for himself already, has been for a while. Stay alive, and stop worrying about how many people will die. Your responsibility is to not be one of them, nothing more.

There's really no hope for anything else, just that any given one of us might outlive Donald Trump, if we even really want to. We very well may find ourselves surviving only to envy the dead. So, you don't believe Richard Smith but I will make any bet anyone here can cover that you can't prove Biden didn't take part in any civil rights demonstrations in the 60s, and in any case I see no claim that he has violated Twitter's terms of service, so we're done here. My idea of being a democratic was passed on to me from my father. He was a hard working first generation American, born in 1918 in the middle of the Spanish Flu which already took his older brother.  As he grow the great depression hit he helped out the family as the oldest child, withdraw from high school for work in the 11 th grade. As time marched on so did dad, marched as in WWII .After the war it was into a mill in Pittsburgh. The rest was EZ street except for the strikes  (for fair wages, decent health care) Dad told me about a giant "FDR".  My father pension after 28.5 years in the mill (a small mill, AM Byers) was 58 dollars a month so u see FDR'S social security was great for mum and dad. Being born in 1918 dad was a notch baby - meaning he had a preminate cut to his SS to pay for WWI. Dad loved life and his family, loved working hard and love the Democrats  ( the lefty kind that did for regular people like FDR). And his national security advisor literally commit treason within the first few hours after the inauguration. Lol Haha! For context I am a US citizen that lives in Australia and I would constantly hear from Australians about how terrible they think the US, using Trump as an example. I was so sick of people talking down on my country based solely on the news and having never been there. My defence was to the US and therefore included Trump. My thoughts were, there’s nothing I can do to change the fact that he’s president for the next 4 years so I might as well remain open-minded about his policies and give him the benefit of the doubt.
Narrator: she no longer gives him a benefit of the doubt She wasn’t even DA at the time.

Keep lying that will defeat trump in November I like the slate star codex example on libertarianism and the cooperation problem from the FAQ posted there. Also kind of applies to anti regulation Republicans. Copied below:

> As a thought experiment, let’s consider aquaculture (fish farming) in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.

> But each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let’s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.

> A thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a complex filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month – still a respectable sum.

> But one farmer (let’s call him Steve) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.

> Everyone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he’s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.

> Once four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying “Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone’s productivity goes down.”

> Everyone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person who is sort of a jerk. Let’s call him Mike. Now everyone is back using filters again, except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit…

> A self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.

> The most profitable solution to this problem is for Steve to declare himself King of the Lake and threaten to initiate force against anyone who doesn’t use a filter. This regulatory solution leads to greater total productivity for the thousand fish farms than a free market could.

> The classic libertarian solution to this problem is to try to find a way to privatize the shared resource (in this case, the lake). I intentionally chose aquaculture for this example because privatization doesn’t work. Even after the entire lake has been divided into parcels and sold to private landowners (waterowners?) the problem remains, since waste will spread from one parcel to another regardless of property boundaries.

> Even without anyone declaring himself King of the Lake, the fish farmers would voluntarily agree to abide by the pact that benefits everyone.

> Empirically, no. This situation happens with wild fisheries all the time. There’s some population of cod or salmon or something which will be self-sustaining as long as it’s not overfished. Fishermen come in and catch as many fish as they can, overfishing it. Environmentalists warn that the fishery is going to collapse. Fishermen find this worrying, but none of them want to fish less because then their competitors will just take up the slack. Then the fishery collapses and everyone goes out of business. The most famous example is the Collapse of the Northern Cod Fishery, but there are many others in various oceans, lakes, and rivers.

> If not for resistance to government regulation, the Canadian governments could have set strict fishing quotas, and companies could still be profitably fishing the area today. Other fisheries that do have government-imposed quotas are much more successful.

> I bet [extremely complex privatization scheme that takes into account the ability of cod to move across property boundaries and the migration patterns of cod and so on] could have saved the Atlantic cod too.

> Maybe, but left to their own devices, cod fishermen never implemented or recommended that scheme. If we ban all government regulation in the environment, that won’t make fishermen suddenly start implementing complex privatization schemes that they’ve never implemented before. It will just make fishermen keep doing what they’re doing while tying the hands of the one organization that has a track record of actually solving this sort of problem in the real world. Lol, remember all the hot takes in the beginning of his presidency?  "He's gonna pivot! He's definitely gonna pivot!" Welcome.  We're a big tent, we just look down on racism, sexism and most other isms.   


If you care deeply about justice, read this

https://joebiden.com/justice/


And I'll let you in on a little secret; most of us are capitalists, we just want it regulated (just like Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism) and we want a strong safety net, so the poor can be housed, get an education, healthcare and food.  

And for every dollar we put into social welfare for children, it pays back $7, so it also has the benefit of making the future better for the whole country. A good portion of the population believes the Trump lies.  Some of them know they are useful lies.  Some of them are doctors. Yeah, sounds about right.  
Welcome. Seems as though I’m going down the same path. Currently very libertarian and I don’t see myself going down the path as a democrat That’s what WALL•E was really cleaning up for all those years. Coming from the person who if would’ve held them to Justice years ago wouldn’t have had the chance to kill a man in broad daylight. You’re a typical shit trumpie liar and I will be sure to get your comments reported You’re full of shit You’re a lying trumpie trying to deflect your President promoting the murder of Americans  No one here is part of a problem. Nobody tried to do that or did that. >. But isn't the issue here that twitter will be now known as a publisher,

The relevant laws don't differentiate between a "publisher" and a "platform."  Twitter, CNN, Facebook, Reddit, or any other website cannot currently be successfully sued for libel/slander based on the content that a user puts on the site.  

It doesn't matter if they curate the content and remove anything they don't like.  A person could attempt to sue whoever posted a particular tweet for defamation, but it wouldn't get far if they tried to sue Twitter.

> For example, CNN was sued and lost for the convington incident.

This is because CNN was the originator of the material under dispute.  Sandmann's claim was that CNN created and distributed (by written word and spoken word) false information that harmed his reputation.  The Section 230 clauses that protect Twitter would cover what a user posted in CNN's comment section, not what CNN produced themselves.

> In this new classification that kid could sue Twitter.

Trump doesn't have the authority to strip Twitter of these protections.  They are part of a law and it would take another full-fledged law to open Twitter up to these types of lawsuits based on what its users post. You can just vote D and not tell anyone. Every.  Single.  Year. **Thank you.**

Not for your switch in party affiliation, but for critically thinking and willingness to change based on new information. It is wildly easier said than done, especially if the switch contradicts a major aspect of your upbringing. I think a lot of people, especially those who are older, are reluctant and even fearful of admitting to themselves that their moral code no longer aligns with their party. 

Both parties and the system itself have massive problems, but regarding policy, humanity, and overall competence, I’m glad you’re on our team ☺️ So, like, what, the first 15 seconds? Welcome!

Democrats are not all the same.  Our views vary, hence the fierce primary.

Broadly, I'd say we are fiscally moderate and socially liberal. Liz will not be VP and no ones “progressives” (i.e. Bernie supporters) anything.

Anyone who claims to be liberal or progressive but still needs something in order to vote,

is a total fraud Oh that’s right - a great bonus. According to the courts, as he has been using this account in performance of his job, it is an official Presidential account as well.  I posted the links to the decision in another reply yesterday. She’s also from FL Why are you such a shit liar? The best piles. Everybody is taking about them. And yet it happens all the time Because it is This is horrible Maybe you shouldn’t smear Democrats and then be a hypocrite and whine about “division” when it’s clearly against the sub’s rules. Maybe you clowns should stop peddling lies because your privilege didn’t entitle you to primary votes.

Trump is hurting people and the country is hurting.

Here you are whining that bros aren’t allowed to smear yet another Democrat. Congrats on the switch. I'm sure it isn't easy. The reason laughing at others because of the colour of their skin is because you aren't racist, and your family, well, are. 

I think it's a bit sad that you have to ask people to be kind, because it speaks volumes about how Republicans treat others. You can probably relax a bit with Democrats I imagine. FOPA was established in 1986. At that time, there were only a few states that issued concealed carry licenses. <1% of the population was licensed to carry. 

The transport provisions of FOPA were established as a common, national standard, to protect gun owners from a patchwork of confusing state-level transport regulations.

Now, gun owners are once again subject to a confusing patchwork of state-level regulations, because the existing law does not adequately recognize the current state of gun use. Allen was arrested not because her actions posed any sort of criminal threat, but because the law didn't recognize her inoffensive behavior as inoffensive.  The law improperly and needlessly criminalized her behavior, just as the patchwork state-level transport laws did prior to FOPA.  FOPA is now failing to accomplish the purpose for which it was established. FOPA needs to be updated, keeping in mind that >10% of adults are now licensed to carry concealed weapons. 

"Common Sense" says that if applying the written law results in injustice, the law should be modified to eliminate that injustice.  A truly common-sense approach to gun control demands that many current gun restrictions need to be relaxed. 

>They don't need to allow you to brandish it in public.

I don't think you understand how "concealed" carry works. No concealed carry license in the nation allows a permit holder to "brandish" their firearm in public. Unelected Trump-monkey. Just to add, many people I know say they are republicans because of fiscal reasons.  Basically saying Democrats are Tax and spend. Democrats are much better for the budget, much better for the economy, and much better for reducing the National Debt.  Republicans only prop up the economy in the short term by borrowing so of course it’s going to look good.  Borrowing against my kids and grandkids.

(Some borrowing is fine, but we should borrow in down times and the pay it back during good times. ) ...and fascism. Underrated comment. Astute observations, thanks I mean to an extent... 

Politics and voting a fundamentally social exercise. It’s not a religious or spiritual ritual. It is a dialogue with others and a statement about how you want your representatives to conduct government to serve you *and* the whole community. DeSantis has been sweeping the numbers under the rug for somet ime now and he fired that one lady that wouldn’t misreport the numbers on the state website

He might be in legal jeopardy with this is all over Good for you! Be sure to vote in November, and not just for the President but for downballot democrats as well. We need more people who will vote in every election, including local elections MLK defined riots as “the language of the unheard” I grew up in North Central IL in the middle of the land of racism, hypocrites, alcoholics, and people willfully blinded by their own stench of ignorance. My dad is a vet (drafted) from the Vietnam era and still talks and acts as if the world owes him a big f'n favor. Additionally, he's probably the most obtuse person I've ever know.  He is a Trump supporter and will defend literally *anything* he does or says even when it's obviously wrong.  Him and others in my family seem to communicate by criticizing others, complaining about pretty much everything, and always making comments when they notice people of color. I think I'm still dealing with the emotional fallout (probably apparent) some 15 years after I moved out. For some reason, even as a young kid, judging others and saying derogatory things about people of color in an attempt at humor, never set well with me.  It took me awhile to come to this realization, but I find myself identifying more with the left than the right, especially in this day and age, even after growing up a very conservative environment. 

In your closing remarks, you pleaded for readers to be kind, which you don't have to do, ever. If someone, anyone, doesn't like what you have to say based on what you truly feel is right, fuck them. I interpret this as evidence of being shell-shocked from possibly witnessing others verbally making similar affirmations, as mentioned above, to or around your family. I can relate to this very well. I grew up essentially in fear of expressing and sharing my concerns regarding politics, society, government affairs, etc. My old man, especially, acted as if he was a dictator of our family. He would become so enraged and start yelling (and still does) anytime somebody disagrees with him politically.  This gave me a lot of anxiety, which I feel I'm still recovering from. 

No one should have to live in fear for speaking their personal truths around their family.  If this is the case, then it's time to move on from your family. I am old enough to know that there is no reason to keep toxic people in your life, friends and family included. If anybody doesn't respect you for your opinion, especially after you provide your reasoning for holding such an opinion, wash your hands of them and move on with your life.  This is especially true if you're financially successful and functionally independent. 

There will come a day when your family elders will need you much more than you need them. As such, you shouldn't feel the slightest bit of remorse for seeing less of them to protect your own mental health and, the health of your kids.  You are your own person. You have your own interpretations of the world and you have the *right* to form your own opinions based on your best judgments.  You owe nothing to anyone for holding such opinions, but you do owe it to *yourself* for forming them. I would encourage you do not be bashful about expressing your beliefs when the moment arises. If your family and your friends can't accept your perspective that's their problem, not yours. Political beliefs are wrapped up in one's worldview. Unless you see that your parents are thinking about changing theirs, it's best not to bring it up. Even when people disagree with their own political party, they're often reluctant to change because of the domino effect to everything else. There’s a separate “official” presidential twitter feed. He’s using his personal account. That can happen if you’re an idiot. I mean the list is endless. If you can’t see he is more immoral an modern candidate ever then not sure what Anyone can say to convince otherwise There’s a difference between things you don’t like and straight up lies meant to ruin someone’s reputation Stop supporting violence. Didnt he delete the server AFTER  having it been subpoenaed by the courts? Thats not advocating violence.

I personally don't think violent or nonviolent measures will have a impact on him. 

See how you were obviously wrong? I think we are miscommunicating, or maybe I'm wrong. But isn't the issue here that twitter will be now known as a publisher, so like CNN for example, and not a place where 3rd party content is posted. For example, CNN was sued and lost for the convington incident.  In this new classification that kid could sue Twitter. But last week couldn't. I quoted you advocating violence.  

Not sure how that is lying....but good luck with that.

I can see me quoting your words back to you has only infuriated you.  Perhaps you now need to go loot and riot.  That is how it works right? Don’t forget the oaths he took to the wives he cheated on, and the thousands of business agreements he violated .... That in no way advocates violence. 

Why are you lying? Are you that angry that you have to lie?

Please calm down and discuss what I'm saying and think clearly. Republicans had a unified government three times (I think?) in the past 20 years, and what laws/Executive Orders did they pass to stop abortion Once And For All?

<crickets>

But when they’re the minority and need to fundraise and get out the vote it’s THE BAYBEEZ!!!

It’s so transparently cynical. "Nonviolent measures will have no impact on him. Unfortunately."

I am not angry.  I just am pointing out nonviolence is best and resorting to violence is not the answer.  You keep disagreeing with me.  I am not sure why you want violence.  Feel free to explain yourself. It’s not normal but the media and democrats hype it up like black people are the only race that’s killed in this country. Only way the dems win is to keep us divided and to keep the blacks as victims so they continue to vote for dems. Sad honestly... RIP George Floyd everyone thinks this was an unjust murder and want justice not just democrats but they along with the media want you to think everyone is racist. Divide and conquer! United we stand divided we fall and the democrats continually try to divide us along with the media and number of other global liberal interests. Your political beliefs are for you and for you alone. You don’t have to say anything to anyone if you don’t want especially when it comes to voting. Who you vote for is a very personal thing in my opinion I am worried all the rioting and looting is going to keep spreading the virus.  A lot of the pictures show people without masks.  It's bad enough to destroy a city but now they are also risking lives from spreading covid-19. Rubbish editorialized thread title. If you actually read the story, (a) it's just three former supporters profiled, two of whom are still "not sure" about whom they will vote for in November, and (b) the reason they're abandoning Trump is his rejection of science during the pandemic, not the way other supporters of his are discounting the deaths of the elderly. Where did i advocate violence? 

Your stance seems really thin and you seem to be goading me? How angry are you actually? Do you support rioting and looting?

Peaceful protests have shown to be successful and our current government is very willing to listen to them. I’ve always kept my political beliefs to myself when it comes to family. Good on you for coming to your own realisations. So many of us are brainwashed by our parents in an effort to maintain a good relationship with them. If I were you I would just not talk about politics with them and then vote however you like come Election Day. I consider myself open minded and even stood up for Trump at the beginning of his presidency but now too many things have happened and there’s just no way I can vote for him after everything he has said and done. Three people a day.  992 in 2018 You seem angry and are advocating for violence.

My stance is that violence is not the answer. Wow, nice to see the trolls spreading lies in this thread.

It's almost as though they think she is a likely VP pick and they are desperate. Combination of bad reporting and poor phrasing.  And in some cases intentional misreporting.  I wouldn't have any problem getting rid of police unions and jury trials for all police misconduct.  It should be part of their contract.  It should be a quick trial in front of a judge with an appointed attorney, and triple the punishment for any law enforcement personnel.    I am all for giving law enforcement lots of powers and money (salaries should be tripled or more).  But when they abuse their power, they should be punished very harshly with minimal due process. Idk what’s going on either. It’s very annoying. There are a *ton* of news articles stating that Klobuchar "didn't bring charges" against the police officer.  It's a little infuriating because that's technically true.  She didn't bring charges because she had moved on to the Senate already.

For whatever reason, many of the root news stories incorrectly reporting this are British.  [The Guardian](https://www.independent.co.uk/us-election-2020/amy-klobuchar-vice-president-joe-biden-george-floyd-derek-chauvin-a9539501.html) and [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/us-election-2020/amy-klobuchar-vice-president-joe-biden-george-floyd-derek-chauvin-a9539501.html).  Many [other outlets](https://www.blackenterprise.com/amy-klobuchar-denied-prosecuting-officer-at-center-of-george-floyds-death/) have cited to the Guardian. Everyone has to vote. 

Or it will likely be the new normal. Hopefully WHO and also our allies across the world are just holding off and waiting to see if we can get rid of this scourge of an administration. We can make it up to all of them later. It’s getting fucking bad. Almost every comment removed for “dividing” yet it’s creating more division. So she broke the law and your argument is that she should be above the law.  LOL!  That 1/10 is still pretty high for people with firearms.  Considering you need a background check to even get one. This is common sense gun control because not all states agree with you and interstate travel made this provision for you to have your firearm. They don't need to allow you to brandish it in public. Umm...this is like the 3rd or fourth step toward justice after the first few failed because of prosecutors and the police union. I like that you're masquerading as a Democrat while also commenting a ton on conservative subreddits I laughed my ass off, why didn’t he just tweet that crap?  Did the poor widdle guy need some yummy camera time or what?  Useless media whore, let him hold some stupid bumpkin rallies, spread COVID like he wants, and keep him off the airwaves.  And tell Ivanka to get busy with him to stop his idiotic tweets for an hour or two every day.  Damn, is that too much to ask? I ridicule a massive racist liar who stokes racial fires and makes rash decisions with consulting zero professionals. 

Show me where I became that? 

Be careful to not become a troll while pretending to make a point. The others should be in custody, too. Proojjeeeeecccttttiooonnnn. Also been posted elsewhere but "If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."  -  Barack Obama  Most undemocratic thing in the world to remove comments you don’t like. He’s also retweeted a video recently of someone saying “The only good democrat is a dead democrat.”  

So, it’s not _just_ African Americans.  He wants violence against democrats, too! Yeah Covid is very weird virus for sure. Also has been posted elsewhere but "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable." -jfk Kemp is a lying pig.  Shocker, right? Yes exactly. I’ve had people tell me she should’ve done something despite the grand jury ruling. Like 1. she didn’t have power to do anything and 2. yoy can’t prosecute after the grand jury ruled it was justified.. It's really disturbing how many people on Reddit apparently dislike living under the rule of law. Eliminating grand juries would be a terrifying development. Nothing says take me seriously like burning down buildings and stealing a tv. > Troll and blocked

Lol That's getting attention.  Police kill about two people a day in America. There were 4 complaints while she was attorney. 3 were about conduct, which is up to the police department to decide, not the law. The fourth was about the killing of a suspect that happened at the hands of 6 officers, including Chauvin. The case went to a grand jury who decided not to take up the charge as it was deemend justified, but Klobuchar was a senator by the time it went to the grand jury as the incident happened late december, close to the senate inauguration This virus can kill some and not phase others. I’m not a virologist but I can’t think of any virus than can go undetected because there were no symptoms. This has been mentioned elsewhere but peaceful protests have been attempted.  This is the result of years of deaths that have had no justice. What were the ones she couldn’t review? I have seen this thread picked up in a couple locations Putin kills his own people, and Trump works for Putin. They already murdered one guy this week. And any whites who support them. In an alternate universe, Jason Chaffetz is writing Articles of Impeachment against President Clinton for the 11,000 Americans who died during the Pandemic. Absolutely agree. NPR has a great article recently about states that were testing everyone (or large random samples) and finding tons of asymptomatic cases. Good quote.

I just wish more showed restraint.  We shouldn't let anger get the best of us.  The violence undermined all the peaceful protestors that were doing the right thing.  They were getting their point across.  Now everyone is just focused on the riots. You’re right, and we had better step up the testing process if we’re ever going to count people who were infected but asymptomatic. 

This will make a fascinating book one day. I loved the Great Influenza 1918/1919. It was so factual but in a way that you just couldn’t put it down. I thought this quote from Elie Mystal summed it up well:

>“This country could be on fire almost every night in almost every city. It’s not, because most black people in this country choose to exercise tremendous restraint. Most black people are still willing to talk this out. Most black people have the courage and fortitude to withstand the violence done against us without lowering ourselves to the level of an American police officer.” Amy did absolutely nothing wrong. She wasn’t even an attorney anymore when the 6 officers killed the man with a knife That’s a lie NOOOOOO 

Stop spreading this. Klobuchar was a senator when the charges were dismissed for the killing of the man. The prior charges she didn’t prosecute were not legal offenses Be careful not to become what you ridicule. Kemp is a crook. That is all. It’s a tough time alright. 45’s pathetic addresses to the nation do nothing to provide comfort and confidence. We have to rely on Governors, Congress, public servants and each other right now. 158 days to voting day... They've called his bluff. Looting continues but the military has not taken their orders from the tweet and they're not shooting. That was a great sentiment 90 years ago. Here's [a collection of cases that you can start with.](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/legal)  I think that you'll find the protections for websites hosting third-party content is fairly strong. [I wish that would work, but how will you peacefully get rid of more than 390 million firearms. And simultaneously start protecting vulnerable communities? ](http://imgur.com/a/OoxXhaJ)

Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempts to disarm the people must be stopped, by force if necessary.

Karl Marx More guns = more violence. How about getting rid of the ones you have. = less violence. Our reputation is destroyed internationally. 

We may never recover as nation's will not trust us to have stable leadership in future terms. It's horrible to experience. I'm glad everyone carries a camera now and this is being brought to the fore., But it still horrible. So why are you targeting Klobuchar, instead of the governor, the entire state legislature, the president, the media, the grand jury who declined to convict, etc. Why is this burden being put on her? I'm not rioting myself. And I'm not sure there is a solution, beyond voting. Jimma Hoffa would like a word. Get it together people. ffs. It was. But do not forget that this all started with the contract on America and the neocons. This iteration of is simply the culmination of that plan. The first big move was 1998 and the healthcare plan. The second was the 2000 election. This was supposed to be the final thrust but we got lucky and they picked a real whackjob this time.
Liberals and democrats need to stop fighting about the scraps and start to find some cohesion or all the things we have fought our entire lives for will be gone. We are getting old man. It’s time for the next wave to step up big time. So what?  Even if she wasn’t the attorney then?  Why didn’t she stand up for any of the minorities then?  Nobody did. Yup Thanks Amy for the Breaking News! So insightful! She was a senator by the time that case went to court. Let me repeat. She was not an attorney when that case was brought to court. Fake news has become so rampant on the populist left and it’s frightening, because it shows the left wing isn’t immune. She had the chance after he murdered a Native American man. Let's be part of the solution and not the problem.

Violence is not the answer.  That is exactly the same mentality we are ripping Trump for.  Let's be better. He can’t actually do this. There is no provision in the treaty that allows for it and the dues he is withholding from the current fiscal year can be consider US debt. 

If the House sued over power of the purse this could get an injunction through next year when the SCOTUS can hear it. But no consequences. They are doing what they have always done. We are recording now. It's our society sliding into authoritarianism. Trump has spent so much time delegitimizing the free press that police feel that they can do this in broad daylight on camera without repercussions. It's a flagrant violation of not just their rights but our rights. As long as the police can control who sees things happening, they can control the narrative. Soooooooooo many piles Mhm Wait wasn’t she the one who didn’t prosecute his other issues/violence? The excecution of Donald John Trump has been too long delayed. Justice be done "Working" may be a bit extreme. Not sure he wants riots. 

Nonviolent measures will have no impact on him. Unfortunately. Most Republicans think that they are the only citizens with a military background and the ability and knowledge to use firearms. 
That’s a deadly mistake! Trump is fueling the fire I agree. 

I am just sad to see it working.  I just don't support rioting and looting.  We should focus on nonviolent actions and not destruction of property. To be fair, as you know lots of diseases have symptoms similar to COVID.

I recently ended up with a nasty little bug and got tested. Negative. Turns out I got something from my kids that ended up being roseola. I would've never guessed goddamned roseola.

Parainfluenza is a legit piece of shit, too.

Also, I've read that the sensitivity can be an issue-- wonder which test you had? I know some of the tests aren't good at catching low-load cases. I really wish we had settled on only a handful of tests nationally but... here we are. Pharmacist. About a quarter of our department has missed time. Despite being in tiny room with guy that later tested positive, then having symptoms myself ... two negatives If it were I would tell you to buy an SKS or a Kalashnikov. Rioting is a natural extention of what trump brings. 

Trump does nothing but blame minority communities and intentionally mocks and doesn't listen to them. 

Riots are unavoidable. I agree which makes seeing all the rioting and looting all the more sad.  Not the correct solutions as guns/rioting/looting is not the way to make the needed improvements. What’s not fair is you being a douche about a two day difference between endorsements. You were attempting to refute my point about Sanders looking like an idiot if he didn’t jump aboard the Biden train after all the other candidates. By nit picking the 2 day difference. Troll and blocked. Stupid cunt. I wish only the worst for her. Why is Obama saying this is normal? Trump once again made a dumb statement, but let's not try to excuse all the rioting and looting.  

A bad situation made worse all around. This feels like guérilla marketing Sitting president incites violence on to his people should be reason enough to have him forcibly removed 😆 Hard to tell exactly what would happen next. But it's likely bad. A bitch would. Way under counted and especially by red states, in Florida we have had an extremely high amount of false negative test results, and the virus morphing so to speak in the heat...I had mad fever for 10 days, then agonizing abdominal issues, for another week, as have other people, so YES...way under counted ! Another Republican caught lying? Start a new pile over here please. That’s true. There’s also a lot of people that have gotten the virus and never been tested or even showed symptoms so all of our numbers are way off in different ways. I don't know about all of you but I'm looking at this photo and thinking to myself WTF this country would have been like and should have been if she were to have won, BTW she did win!! She won the people's vote and that's the most important thing, so please everyone out there that reads this get everyone you know to either mail in a voting ballot or get everyone you know out to vote on November 3rd and have them all vote for Joe Biden as well as for every Democrat on the ballot. To all my liberal friends that have doubts just remember this with Joe Biden you will get something you want passed but with this wannabe dictator in the White House you will get what you have been getting and that is NOTHING!! WE NEED ALL LIBERALS TO COME TOGETHER WITH DEMOCRATS TO DEFEAT THIS POS. WE WILL HAVE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS JOINING US TO VOTE THIS WANNABE DICTATOR OUT OF OFFICE ON NOVEMBER 3RD. Just remember what THE LAST REAL PRESIDENT THAT WE HAD ALWAYS SAID AND CONTINUES TO SAY: VOTE!! 

We may have overestimated but I think this is a logical approach. And  I do think there are Covid related death early on that weren’t counted because no one knew the different ways that this virus kills. Klob ain’t perfect that’s for sure. She has a questionable prosecution history, but honestly, I feel like everyone does. People say Harris is racist for her prosecuting record, but it’s such a hard thing to judge. Obviously it’s Klobuchar’s fault for not seeing into the future and not Trump’s for encouraging violence /s Is someone saying it is normal...? But that would be the *start* of something big, not the *end*. So he was arrested but not charged with anything?

Need to know precisely what happened from the moment he was arrested until he was released. Was there an arraignment? Was he brought before a judicial magistrate or a ranking law enforcement official, or anyone else who has an actual career to worry about ending? I’m saying it’s because they’re black. She's doing more then that r/SocialistRA I just mean attributing all of the deaths that were higher than earlier averages is probably a gross overestimate. I don’t think you can count them as Covid deaths in good faith even if they were caused by people not going to the hospital. That overinflated Covid death rates. Could not agree more. The government has no right to insight violence against any of its citizens. The cops obviously are not protecting the citizens. They attack liberals because they see them as weak “cucks” I am not sitting around and waiting to get harmed for my beliefs. I wish more ppl thought like you, keep speaking truth! I, personally, walk softly but carry a big stick. The harder they come the harder they fall. That garbage bag trump was trying to sway the black vote not long ago, he already proved he doesn’t give a shit once again. Edit: tbh I don’t think Biden would do any different (I hope to be proven wrong) but the trump administration needs to get the f*** out Watched this live on CNN last night. The camera crew was respectful and cooperative, they identified themselves- and the state police arrested them all LIVE. 

How stupid can state cops be? Watching them arrest a peaceful camera crew reporting on police abuse. 

OMG read the full article!! They let the white reporter go and arrested the brown one. Holy shit! Biden is older than Betty White.  His social security number is 75. No there are minorities in the Democratic Party Why are liberals so bad at politics?  Explain to me what the article was about. #whataboutism That, and being literally the worst person the democrats could pick. Depends on the test. Depends on the timing. With a large enough sample you'll have false results. It's expected-- probability given sensitivity and accuracy guarantees it. That's the nature of the beast and is a given. 

You're a nurse? Physician? If they were all viral tests, it would depend on the timeframe. If they slipped in an antibody test to see if they had the virus previously, then that could have been positive. Marlboro man. That dudes kill count is insane I don’t think they’re making that big of a leap considering what we know about this virus so far. 

For example,  this virus can cause blood clots so you can throw stroke in the mix. It can impact all the organs meaning a person with kidney disease could go into kidney failure. These are just two examples of how the virus is responsible for a deadly event but the end result, rather than Covid , is what’s being reported.


https://abc13.com/blood-clots-covid-19-coronavirus-covid-symptoms/6217594/


https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/929284 Ive seen people test negative, the positive, then back to negative all withing 10 days. Several people. I... thank you! I appreciate you being fair on this.

Also, love the username. Given that performance arts will be depressed a while, that may be the only place we'll be able to see plays. It is adding useless fuel to the fire to call upon citizens arming themselves against a government with the force of police and military behind it. Unless you espouse an all out armed civil war, it is mere senseless theatrics that only add to the emotion of the moment and accomplish nothing. We are already in this mess because of Republican zero-sum thinking and politics and guns are the ultimate zero-sum solution. No thanks, we've got enough of that mentality already. Goddamn coward This is fair. There’s a whole lot of assumptions made in this article to come to a clickbait title. Undercounting is certainly going on, being behind on the death rate is also obviously happening, but they make a lot of leaps to get to that 50% number. 2016 was ***STOLEN*** from us. The entire Minneapolis and Minnesota State police should be disbanded. Ok I’ll bite:

OT God: still valued morality above all else. He would smite Trump. I’d pay to watch it actually.

NT God: see above. Little less aggro but values were the same. Don’t cheat on your wife, don’t be a dick in general. Do until the lowest man, blah blah blah. Trump would receive boils or some shit.

Zeus: not a big morality guy but did value things like Oaths. Someone was bad if they broke their word....hmmmm.  Trump already has broken the oath to protect citizens a couple times over. Allowed and encourages Russian interference. Doesn’t do everything he can to help nation from ongoing pandemic. Yeah Zeus would rape Trump in front of everyone on Mount Olympus and watch him squeal like a little orange piggy. Greeks were cool with that. That's what Biden is for. 1. People can have this and be asymptomatic or even just mildly symptomatic.
2. The virus typically kills between .5-1% of the population it infects and spreads quickly all else being equal. We would have seen WAY more deaths if it had been circulating for another two or three months unrestrained. Given the likelihood of super spread events the holidays would've likely seen HUNDREDS of thousands dead. ICUs all over would've been absolutely slammed.

Unless the virus isn't that virulent or deadly this doesn't make sense. Which God? Old testament,  new testament, or rapey Zues God? Could be, but I know people in both areas that tested positive for antibodies that were quite ill during that time period. I think most countries are undercounting. Hence parainfluenza which is rarely tested for. The other endemic coronaviruses can also cause nasty outbreaks and even be moderately nasty in some groups. 

For it to have been here since October means it would have had to have emerged here. Given it’s dynamics among a naive population it’s not going to gradually spread and then suddenly explode. That’s not how exponential growth works in a moderately to highly contagious illness like this.

This just doesn’t pass the logical sniff test.

Edit: OK, downvotes. Cute. 

Think through this. This disease has an unrestrained R0 of 2-3, which means it will DOUBLE OR TRIPLE in days or weeks. If it had been circulating in OCTOBER that would have meant massive outbreaks on NYC scale since then. This beggars belief. Unrestrained for 4 months most places would've seen .5-1% of their populations dead by now, given what we know about the IFR.

This makes no logical sense. Just think through the dynamics. I know a lot of things are “flu-like”.

I’m saying they were tested for flu and they were negative. The illness was viral but they couldn’t identify the virus. Lots of things are “flu-like.”  

COVID’s general symptoms list is in line with tons of viral respiratory illnesses:

Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea

None of the above symptoms are even remotely limited to COVID. From influenza to parainfluenza, it’s very possible to experience the above with a wide variety of viral infections. 

There is little to no evidence that COVID has been circulating since before Wuhan. The symptoms described by folks who had it line up with COVID, not the flu.

The people who had it in October that I talked to said they were tested for flu and they were all negative for it. In my area there was some kind of pneumonia going around last year in late October. No deaths as far as I know but it wasn’t flu-related. It was viral but they couldn’t identify the virus. 

COVID has indeed been in the States for months. The only thing unfair is trumpf - alive! It is news. The first CDC report about a month ago would have showing it missed around 35k deaths. Now it would be about 47k. However, this source is questionable and gives no link to the CDC report used to come up with these numbers, making it more suspect. Just so everyone is clear, [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/joshscampbell/photo) is Josh Campbell, and [this](https://api.everipedia.org/v2/wiki/amp/lang_en/omar-jimenez-journalist) is Omar Jimenez. Race was the difference - nothing else. Your attempt to paint all this as nothing new won't fly. We are clearly, obviously in a different place with a different level of corruption, injustice and inequality. And most of us see that. The ho hum crowd that would rather dismiss it are being cynical and lazy. This is the time to take every action possible to bring the country to a better place. Protesting is one way, voting 1s another. We need both. Exactly Most rich people I know vote Democrat, but then again, these are not the billionaires you might be talking about. And, most rich people I know are very highly educated (MDs/Phds). I didn't quote the headline, thus no quotation marks. I made a point, and gave a reason as to why it's valid. Once again a misleading headline. 
Let the downvotes begin. Same here. I would never vote for someone who has absolutely no qualifications to be president in the first place. Add in his bizarre thoughts and behaviors and I wonder how anyone can support him Only arrested because he is black! Fucking racist mother fuckers All charges against cops went to grand juries at the time.  Blame them.

Edit:  According to Klobuchar. It's not normal in 2020 America the constitution isn't permanent That's the thing though: every single viral respiratory illness can cause bronchitis, pneumonia, etc.

I once had a nasty cold that became pneumonia. I've had bronchitis from flu as well. 

I think it's SUPER important that we remain thoughtful in what we attribute to this because we also need to be scientific in our approach. Let's not be that which we hate (unscientific). Quotes because that’s what her family says. Not sure if the actual diagnosis. Getting off our asses to vote means all of us, no matter where we live.  ALL OF US. I got a bad bronchitis last September from a cold. 

Maybe that was COVID too! While we’re speculating, of course. I’m sorry to hear that. :-(

Why the scare quotes around pneumonia? Lots of things cause pneumonia. 

You can die of viral pneumonia from a common cold. Rare, but not u heard of. 

Your cousin probably died of influenza or a cold— there’s no good reason to believe it was COVID in January. Or maybe that was influenza? We had a bad flu season this year. Let’s say he took three and the third came up positive it might have been the point of sufficient viral load. 

Or it could’ve been bad procedure. 

Hard to say without details. Doesn’t mean the test is bad per se. Could be. May not be. False and irrelevant.  Like your very own president. Charlottesville was "good people". 

He clearly doesn't think these are good people. Good point. My assumption is the tests were within a day of each other based on the conversation, but I'll see if I can get more details. They only took the tests after getting mild possible symptoms. I know this feels like a low point but try to keep in mind that we've always managed, over the last 3.5 years, to find a way to make a nearly unbelievably bad situation worse.

So this is maybe just the middle of our decline in to total hell on Earth.

In a month we'll be looking back on only a couple of cities burning in a race war and merely 100k dead as the good old days... I do NOT doubt that we are undercounting, but all these anecdotal stories in this thread about someone who got BRONCHITIS (wut) or a bad cold/flu are proof of jack fucking shit.

Ain't none of you had a bad cold or flu? Come on now.

Let's not become as bad with science as the other side, for fuck's sake. Imagine that. With all the exposure the bastard already gets and very much wants, that video would be the most watched thing ever, without him ever knowing. 

Though I’d rather have him and his cronies and enablers getting a nice little cell. Cheating at everything, only to end up with less than nothing and being remembered of it each day. November?

Come on now, I get that it may have started earlier, but now we're getting into conspiracy shit.

There is no good scientific evidence it was here in November.

If the virus is as virulent as we believe then if it had been here since November uncontrolled we would've seen a MASSIVE spike in January, which we obviously did not.

We also had an above-average influenza season so maybe let's attribute this to things that make sense and not go off on pretending that COVID has been here since October? As far as viral tests go, not really, no. 

Depends on the test and when tested.

By this logic, every country is wrong. This isn't really meaningful without knowing the timeframe and when the positive came through and which tests were used.

Tests for any disease are dependent upon what the test looks for and when. Hell, he couldn’t even govern the freakin’ napkins. Unfortunately, even record turnout could still lead to him winning again. It all depends on where people show up. It doesn’t matter if those older voters in New York show up, it matters if they do in Arizona, Wisconsin, etc. these people aren't inherently evil and they deserve a voice. My parents were Republicans until the Obama Era and they're great people. Same with the area near the Arizona-California border. Tons of trump supports, all great people. If they vote in mass, and are the majority, they deserve the victory He would have to federalize them first.  I think Donald is all talk on this one.  He did not federalize the VA national guard in Charlottesville, so I don’t think he will in MN. The numbers are awful there lately, I’ve been watching it explode- terrible Admittedly, this is "friend of a friend," but I know of someone who took three separate tests, and two came back negative, one positive. In Mexico the government started reporting a lot of deaths due to “atypical” pneumonia that everyone kind of knew was most likely COVID so it wouldn’t surprise me if this was being done here too Eh.. one some issues.. yes, on others no. If trump moves in the national guard to meet the protesters.. what is the gov going to do? While I think this poll has some flaw, this is how I think the race will end up, high single digit win for Gideon.

Again I think 50/50 in the Senate is quite likely.  Colorado, Arizona, and Maine are big trouble for the Rethugs.  And Cal Cunningham is a strong candidate who will outperform Biden in NC.  But after that things get pretty uphill.  If we want a working Senate majority, we're going to need a landslide where some of red state Senate races are in play. Did they add a variable for mass protests? We need someone who is palatable to moderate GOP and independents to swing those votes to the Dems.   Warren will do the opposite. Fortunately, governors and mayor have a greater effect in the average Americans every day life than the Orangutan in the Oval Office. They do not have the progressive cred that Warren does. I am an outsider (non US person) and am amazed by the stuff the Republicans get away with. We have some good leaders but on a national level, its dark. There's only so much they can do. Val Demings for VP. She could take the justice reform file and Biden complete health care. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker at DOJ to support Val on justice reform. Do it!! What about Susan Rice of Donna Brazile? The "funding" comes from hospitals making claims on insurance and Medicare.  They get paid no matter what they diagnose, but are paid on an average scale for the diagnosis.  If they say it's pneumonia, they still get paid.  It's how reimbursement works. Not really.  We have strong leaders like Phil Murphy and Jay Inslee It's ongoing, so it's still news and needs to be emphasized.  The Pandemic virus keep saying it's "only" X number or percent, as if 103,000 deaths in two months is nothing. To be clear, he’s calling for violence against *African*-American citizens. She had 3, none of which were violations of the law. You can’t prosecute someone for not breaking the law Went around South Florida and Seattle starting in mid December. Your very own Amy Klobuchar has multiple opportunities to arrest the office who killed Floyd. Amy Klobuchar had multiple opportunities to charge the officer who killed Floyd. Ban Trumpo from Twitter. That would cut off his nuts. I respectfully disagree. I guess the courts will decide > Systemic racism and an unlevel socio-economic playing field are one and the same.

At every level of income or "class" police are much more aggressive to black people. Black people, both rich and poor, are brutalized and mistreated by police. White people, both rich and poor are not mistreated by police anywhere close to what happens to black people. Are you seriously trying to twist this terrible event for your benefit?

Racism is the issue at question here. Spinning a man's murder to further you anti-capitalist agenda is despicable. Id worry more about Wendys, Pepsi, and Miller. Systemic racism and an unlevel socio-economic playing field are one and the same. To fix many of society's issues we have to be able to come to grips with the fact that the judicial and law enforcement systems are a product of poor education, healthcare and income opportunities. The billionaires are laughing all the way to the bank playing poor whites and blacks against each other. Sadly, many perpetuate this and have created a self-sustaining epidemic in this country via ignorance and fear. If we create opportunities for people, educate people and truly embrace each other's cultures and norms that will bring about real change. Its a shitty situation and I cannot believe what a malignant caricature of America this country has become. Oh yeah definitely. Be responsible. Educate yourself before you buy, and decide if gun ownership is right for you. 

I'm also not very worried about that, I'm also not very worried that the government will come and kill me. But since that is a possibility I did rather be prepared. My Queen. There are plenty of reasons to not buy one as well. I'd say if you have young kids, you'd better at least have that shit locked away in a room that it itself has locks. 

I'm not worried about my GOP neighbors coming to kill me. Yeah, there's plenty of other reasons to buy a gun as well. But a "haha it's a joke" threat on your life is also a good one. Sure, eventually.

When it happens, let me know. Off topic are you having any problems with reddit I can't comment on a article my moniker doesn't even show up in the box You go twitter rambo. >How does Twitter maintain its consistency.

Maintaining consistency is not important, Drumming up user enthusiasm and outrage over petty, stupid fucking antics is what is important.

&#x200B;

>If you remember anything about this debate...Twitter has maintained they  are not a publisher and not expected to police their users. The fact  they have finally stepped in but in a highly polarized era and against  the guy who wields his political power like a battering ram...just  further "politicizes" their actions...for a party that already accuses  silicon valley of playing to the left. 

None of this matters, or even has anything to do with you. Yeah lets not fall for this. Buy one if you want but not because of this. The forensics on this pandemic are going to be very interesting. As will the explanation for the lack of tests. His calls arent getting much attention.  As far as what he should do, I'm no political strategist but if wants to get more people behind him simply not Being Trump wont win. >She broke federal law

That law is another example of one that doesn't meet the "Common Sense Gun Control" criteria.  Licensed concealed carriers commit violent crimes at 1/10th the rate of the general public.  There is no need for the transportation restrictions of FOPA to apply to people with concealed carry licenses.

FOPA should be modified with national recognition of state-level CCW permits.  With a permit from any state, a licensee should be allowed to carry within their vehicle in any state while engaged in interstate travel. So you don’t really know....he’s called for justice several times. I’m not really sure what you think he should be doing and I don’t think you do either. Real easy to complain. Test wildly inaccurate Anything... Don't ever call me a Trump supporter simply because of my age. He is the most despicable thing I have ever seen.  I agree, however I would still like my fellow workers and citizens armed. 

When a head of state calls for violence against it's people, it's the people's duty to defend themselves. 

The second amendment is for protection from the government. If the president threatens you now, and wishes you dead,  what will he do in the future? Trump is not only a moron but also a terrorist. Everything can be expected from this evil being. Already posted there. :) My 50yo cousin died of “pneumonia” in Colorado in January. All the symptoms match with C-19. Buying guns only profits gun makers, enhances paranoia and increases the chances the firearm will end up causing harm in an unintended fashion or through abuse. Former gun owner speaking. Wrong approach. We have too much focus on guns in this society and not enough on education, civility & analytical thinking. r/liberalgunowners What do you think Biden should do? That's what white leftists do.  Honestly as a person of color and very strongly pro-capitalist, I hate white leftist BernieBros even more than Trumpists or even white supremacists. Decimated means destroying 1 in 10. They need worse than that. Unsettling No shit.
Only 2-3% of people tested. We are on the BRINK!!! We had an outbreak of “ bronchitis “ in AZ in February. 99% of my family got ill with said sickness after a family gathering. This was actually known several weeks ago... It isn't news. What I'd like to see is whether the Trump administration intentionally decided to hamper testing to avoid a higher official count. I'd put good money on it. I'm sure Trump doesn't need to meddle in that, too busy playing golf. All he does is whine like a baby in a meeting "why don't numbers go down? Make numbers go down or I'll find someone who will" 

Some crony is actually making the numbers go down. As rosy as the situation is now, it will be a lot worse by Election Day. The death toll will be 300,000+ and tens of millions will have gone months without any income. That’s fair This is how massacres occur. 

A couple of cops listening to trump could start shooting very soon. Part of the apathy is depression and discouragement; it seems like every liberal I know IRL is convinced that Trump has a 100% chance of winning in November. Some of them have even said that the Republicans will take back the House, which has no basis in even the most pessimistic reality.

So stories like this can encourage some people, not discourage them. I agree with you 100%, but I also feel that stressing the economic problems will more likely unite people in a common struggle while aslo advancing the racial problems. Its impossible to approach fixing the economic problems in the country without addressing the unique economic problems that have been created becauase if slavery, a civil war, and decades of struggle between racist in power and people asking for what their countrymen already have and they don't. We have to directly address the fact that something has to be done economically to address the issues created by those events in Americas past. I find it funny that him speaking his ideals are just misspoken words or gaffes. “He didn’t mean what he said” is always the excuse. No accountability is ever held for these ideals. Makes a racist comment, oh, Joe didn’t mean what he said. Dudes been in politics 40 years. He knows when you say something you better mean it. He meant exactly what he said. He just caught hell for it and wanted to save face. Same with Trump even though he’s less apologetic. 

To me it’s like, how the hell do we end up with these two as our choices? This is NOT the best America has or can do. Any opportunity to divide people, Trump takes it. He’s not a leader, he’s a extreme right-wing Twitter troll. Look forward to hearing from Biden this afternoon. Anecdotally I know a nursing home in Arkansas that lost 9 residents to 'pnuemonia' in November. Someone needs to look into the "tainted" tests the CDC used early in the pandemic. Race is the first thing that should come up. You don't see poor white people getting murdered every day by police officers.

The reporter that was arrested was A REPORTER FOR CNN. He was not poor and didn't have economic hardship.

Police don't check your 1040 or 401k before l arresting or killing you. 

Blaming economic conditions for these events is incredibly tone-deaf. New jersey is one of over 20 states that dont recognize Pennsylvania CCP. The federal government already covers this.  She broke federal law that should be known to every gun owner and if they dont then they should not own a gun.   They already made concessions to gun owners that allow them to transport their guns prohibited in their states.  

>A provision of the federal law known as the Firearms Owners’ Protection Act, or FOPA, protects those who are transporting firearms for lawful purposes from local restrictions which would otherwise prohibit passage.

>Under FOPA, notwithstanding any state or local law, a person is entitled to transport a firearm from any place where he or she may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he or she may lawfully possess and carry it, if the firearm is unloaded and locked out of reach. In vehicles without a trunk, the unloaded firearm must be in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console. Ammunition that is either locked out of reach in the trunk or in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console is also covered. The first one is an over yet The *general concept* of UBCs and red-flag laws are supported, yes.  That support invariably falters once those general concepts are turned into enforceable proposals. 

The reality of gun culture in America is that 10% of adults who are eligible have a license to carry a concealed handgun. It's been 20 years since the start of the concealed-carry revolution in the US.  We are now seeing the second generation of carriers joining the ranks: kids who grew up seeing mom and dad tucking a handgun into a concealed holster every morning. They are now coming of age, getting their carry permits, and registering to vote. 

This is not a group that Democrats can afford to marginalize. The kind of gun control that Democratic leaders are pushing for is only popular in 8 states. Economics and race are very much tied. It’s a factor on its own too and does deserve to be mentioned, but it’s also inherent in the economic situation in this country, and has been for years. 

Not trying to defend the explanation not including racism as a major factor, just that when I hear someone talk about economics, I assume (maybe naively) they understand how much race plays a factor in that. > Another CNN reporter says he was 'treated much differently'
> 
> CNN's Josh Campbell, who also was in the area but not standing with the on-air crew, said he, too, was approached by police, but was allowed to remain.

Hmm... I wonder why Omar Jimenez was arrested but Josh Campbell wasn't... All that text and no mention of race, not even once. I feel like you don't understand what's going on at all... I have no objection to this, it is a free country, you have rights, you have liberty, you can choose to not use a product. He'd just make a fake account immediately and keep spewing rubbish but his ego couldn't withstand no followers. I actually like the bottom part - I just think it’s very hard to have gray area, you either gotta be all in with it and censor everything or censor nothing - with censoring nothing probably being the best way to go about it r/murderedbywords >This is the law from new jersey "New Jersey prohibits any person from transporting, possessing or having a firearm in his or her control in a motor vehicle, unless the firearm is unloaded and contained in a closed and securely fastened case, or locked in the trunk"

That law is not "Common Sense gun control".  That law is asinine, especially when applied to individuals who are otherwise law-abiding, responsible persons.

>it makes her an irresponsible gun owner doesnt it?

No. 

By way of analogy, let's say we are trying to determine if a "yellow" traffic light is too short, causing responsible drivers to run this red light.  You can argue that the people violating that light also violate *other* yellow lights. They are "irresponsible" not because they run the studied light, but because they run other lights as well.  

But you can't argue that people are irresponsible drivers for violating the light in question: The driver could be responsible, but the yellow light is indeed too short to safely stop before it turns red. 

We cannot say that Allen is irresponsible simply for falling on the wrong side of the law you cited.  The other possibility is that the law in question is unacceptably restrictive, and should either be repealed or mitigated. Indeed, this certainly is the case, as evidenced by the extraordinarily low crime rates of licensed concealed carriers in the 42 states with "Shall Issue" concealed carry license policies. 

"Common Sense gun control" would be to *repeal* that law, or otherwise modify it so that it will not lead to such miscarriage of justice in the future.  The law you cited does not pertain to people with a concealed carry license recognized in New Jersey. 

Perhaps New Jersey should adopt "Common Sense Gun Control Laws" like CCW reciprocity agreements with neighboring states. I think that's the real corner they have backed themselves in. The assumption now is everyone they don't tag as a liar is a truth teller.

And what about other countries. Bolsonaro, Modi...them fools lie like a bathroom rug as well. 

The smart thing for them to do is cap it at a certain amount of followers required for check and make it clear they will only provide facts on political issues. Wishful thinking I guess. No Like Trump was Hillary's greatest asset? The very civil and tolerant left!!! and americans have the gaul to criticize china for this sort of thing but ignore it when it happens back home. There will be no repercussions for this I think I'm okay with the union in general...but there are things that should just not be part of the CBA. If they want to protect members rights to due process...fine. And, i think I am okay with them getting paid during an investigation. But if they are in the wrong...that money should be paid back. Further...if you are involved in a lawsuit in which the taxpayer has to pay out on that officer's behalf...the officer should have their pay docked until that money is paid.

The fact is the unions just have too much power. They threaten mayors and city officials with lack of protection or putting their weight behind opponents.

And let's not underestimate how they use racism to their advantage. The whole Union endorsement is  based on being tough on crime...i.e. protecting the value of white property from undesirables. I mean this goes back to the creation of the police force in America to enforce white property rights over black human beings.

I digress because policing in America is a whole issue. But I don't think Unions are necessarily bad. We have numerous federal and state jobs that are unionized. There are just underlying issues to American police that make them particularly problematic. As someone whose lives in MN their whole life, Minnesota is pretty racist. Not surprised for being a small city we’ve made national news twice for police brutality Trump fans the flames of the right and Biden is missing a serious chance to show some leadership credentials Let me be clear.  Law enforcement unions (police unions, prison guard unions, etc.) should be banned, and those who don't report rogue officers should be imprisoned.  I don't care if people considering that "union busting" or whatever, but there is no reason why law enforcement unions should exist period.  We don't allow military unions for good reason, and we should not allow law enforcement unions either. They can’t, they shut down the voices that don’t agree with the narrative they are trying to sell and turn up the volume of those who do. dont know how things work in Chieenah but here in the U.S. we have people called CORONERS and they KEEP RECORDS. You're joking, right? That's your response? I honestly can't tell if you're just trolling, or seriously uninformed. For someone who seems to only ever post in political subreddits, you don't seem to be all that good at coming up with any sort of argument for your side. Again though, I'll help you out since you seem like you need some ammo next time anyone even slightly disagrees with you. Here's the pro-Biden answer to my question since you can't seem to even quickly Google an article and copy paste the contents:

Joe Biden is pushing hard on getting money out of politics, which is a key issue with progressive voters. People see things like super PACs and corporate lobbyists as an integral threat to the country and it's ideals. Joe Biden shares the same beliefs that his other former candidates shared that this is a high priority issue, on the same level all Medicare and the Green New Deal. By holding this position firmly and by working with other progressive lawmakers and organizations, Joe is polling better with progressives every day. Universal background checks for all gun transactions  and red flag laws are supported by the majority of americans. I hope he sues the fuck out of them. AI and quantum computers are definitely going to happen..... So are you for or against states rights? It sounds like youre against them.   Federally you transport your guns through states locked into a case as thats interstate and ruled by the federal government.  Why cant i just drive my concealed carry into a school or bring it into bars those are rights according to you? 

This is the law from new jersey "New Jersey prohibits any person from transporting, possessing or having a firearm in his or her control in a motor vehicle, unless the firearm is unloaded and contained in a closed and securely fastened case, or locked in the trunk"  

She broke the law, yes could be an innocent mistake but it makes her an irresponsible gun owner doesnt it?  The DA chose to prosecute.  The other issue here mandatory minimum sentencing for gun laws.  She faced 3 years due to that but only served 40 days. He will, I think he should refuse to debate Trump.  His brain isn’t as sharp as it used to be and it shows, he misspeaks every other day and it goes viral.  Even if he makes decent points and shows he has better policies, he’ll get blown away on a debate stage... just hang back and let people vote against trump.

I’m also worried that most Democrats, especially those of us under 40, didn’t even have Biden on our draft board when the primaries began.  He would’ve been my 4th choice, and I’m not unique.  I’m still going to vote for him, but the only reason I’m showing up is because we need that Supreme Court pick to replace RBG, if Trump gets 3 justices, the country won’t recover from this administration for 20-30 years. -laughs in china- Is it possible the second wave was this past April? I agree. Despite all the damage...they still happened to kill less people than the police.

Unfortunately...after seeing that this maneuver is actually described and recommend in the police handbook I think the DA is setting up to let this man off. The problem is that the law is set up to protect police...even in their mistakes. A ton of scrutiny. Doesn't matter from who...everyone.

Why just Trump. Why not Biden when he says he marched with Civil Rights activists. What about Joe Smo who says he wants to kick your ass via a tweet because you downvoted them. How does Twitter maintain its consistency.

If you remember anything about this debate...Twitter has maintained they are not a publisher and not expected to police their users. The fact they have finally stepped in but in a highly polarized era and against the guy who wields his political power like a battering ram...just further "politicizes" their actions...for a party that already accuses silicon valley of playing to the left. The clintons are the most powerful political family in the United States. 

For 30 years now the Republicans have been attacking the Clintons, they have accused them of everything up to and including multiple murders, but they have never been able to make anything stick. 

What type of idiot would ever want to take on that type of power?

They are more powerful than Trump, who promised to lock her up, and yet , even when Trump had both houses of Congress on his side he could not get an investigation started on the clintons. 

In fact when it came to dealing with the clintons during the election, Trump had to ask the country of Russia to accomplish the deed that won the election for him.
 
Of course all those people who were investigating buttery males and Ben Ghazi are still alive, as is President Trump.
 
You know what could be happening here? I think maybe the Republicans have been lying all these years. And when they lie, they destroy America's credibility, and they insult the intelligence of the people that they're lying to, their base. Queue Trumpers claiming it's to counter the over counting of covid deaths in blue states to get more funding (a claim they're currently making, at least in California). It’s literally an expression. If there aren't consequences for murderous cops and feckless government, then people have to create consequences. Just another Fux News bubblehead. Corrected. Thanks for the catch...should have reread it b4 post. Just go get lost I'm done with you you're very annoying and no dividing democrats got it? We’ll know after the kitten take-over

They’ll set things straight George. His name was George Floyd. Shaneeon Allen. Roosevelt Twyne.  "Common Sense" gun control calls for *removing* many of these overly-restrictive gun laws, not adding more. I didn't mention about Joe making everything free, or Liz Warren in that comment. All I did was say that I was having doubts that he'll be able to win. You then labeled me a troll. You realize that this is the exact same behavior that we criticize Republicans for when they call literally any news they don't agree with "Fake news", right? Because I expressed doubts about a political candidate (which is literally all everyone did during the primaries) I'm now a troll. Great debating skills there. 

I'll help you out because I genuinely would like to feel more hopeful for Biden's campaign and you're clearly passionate about it. I'm most worried about Joe not driving progressives to vote and that we're gonna see a high Republican turnout but a low Democrat turnout. What is Joe doing now that makes you think this won't be an issue for him? Congress can enforce it, DoJ really has nothing to say about it >Except common sense gun control is fine. 

Shaneen Allen and Roosevelt Twyne would like to discuss "common sense" gun control with you.  Both are licensed, responsible gun owners who were arrested under New Jersey's draconian gun laws. Twyne's charges were eventually dismissed, but Allen couldn't find justice in the law and needed a pardon from the governor. Technically anything the President does any official business on is considered governmental.

It was decided that it was his official account:

I always bet against the America people. There's no question about it. Anyone who has seen the numbers knows that coronavirus deaths are grossly under counted. The only real question is what is the exact amount? Is it 15% or 50%? So we just give up? Sorry, I want my country to be better! I don't know about November but there was definitely an aggressive pnuemonia going around Chicago in early January. Yes, you could argue, but I was actually talking about favorability and popularity data from the time, not just *maybe*. >when was the last time a president was calling for violence against citizens? 

Nixon, along with others.

>This is a whole different level of nonsense. Not that there wasn't  nonsense before, but we should be going in the other direction. 

Racism and a two-tier justice system is common in America, and its going to remain common for the foreseeable future. But who would enforce it? He has direct personal influence over the head of the justice department. Yeah. You can fudge the numbers but you CANT hide the bodies. Except common sense gun control is fine. Its just the NRA lobbys against anybody that even thinks about it. 80% of gun owners support stricter gun control laws. https://lawcenter.giffords.org/category/gun-studies-statistics/polling-data-on-guns/ Except common sense gun control is fine.

Democratic voters want reasonable gun control, but Democratic leadership certainly does not. Democratic leadership is promoting this sort of restriction throughout the nation. I have a friend who works in the analytics department at a hospital group. He said these respiratory specific deaths started spiking in late November, indicating C-19 may have been in the states much earlier than originally documented, being mislabeled for MONTHS ahead of the official pandemic start. I hope you are right friend. Best case scenario I am an idiot that is entirely wrong Do it!  No president before him felt the need to have Twitter.  President Obama used it only sparingly and mostly for impactful statements.  Didn’t exist prior to that.  For the love of god, please get the man off the Twitter sauce. This was the Minnesota State Police, not the Minneapolis PD. I so much want a sixth season of the wire. Or maybe a reboot. Or some other cop show that got all nitty gritty about the daily lives of police. Really, when was the last time a president was calling for violence against citizens? When was the last time armed "protestors" invaded a government building? When did it become ok to arrest news crews? (Note: only the crew lead by the black reporter was arrested.) This is a whole different level of nonsense. Not that there wasn't nonsense before, but we should be going in the other direction. And trump's stupidity continues while Americans are losing their lives every minute. I would obviously prefer a Democrat. But if I had to have a republican, he seems like a good choice.
He is smart. He seems to believe in facts and science. He worked for Obama, because his country asked him to.
I honestly don't know a lot of his stances on issues, but he seems to have his head on decently straight. I'm a black Democrat and listened to the Biden phone call with Ukraine last week. I thought it would prove what I believed all along; that it was a lie. He straight up pressured them into replacing that prosecutor in exchange for signing that loan guarantee. I'll probably still vote for him, but that's a real thing that happened and I'm slightly embarrassed for defending him against my Trump supporting family members. Lol, so true! Doesn't matter what anyone says or thinks. VOTE. VOTE like your VOTE will be the deciding VOTE. And don't only VOTE in major elections. VOTE in all your local elections too. Your county website should have all the info. If you can't find it, ask your local library for help. And GOP governors who want to reopen and blame the Ds for overreacting to the virus and screwing the economy. This will be their play heading into November. All these things are run a run on a state level AND the major discrepancies were found in only Republican states 62,985,106 +/- dumbasses. Grew up in rural California and it's the same there. It's like some dilusional fantasy about rugged individualism. Many of them are still playing cowboy. What else besides play golf and cheat at it. I'm sure Trump is somehow making the CDC mislabel shit. Exactly what they've been taught.

We need a complete overhaul. "I like Emperor Hirohito. He's a very strong leader." Beto didn’t help our cause there The only time I don’t turn the channel when he comes on is when he is walking up or down the steps of Air Force One.  I keep hoping he trips and breaks his neck on liveTV. Trump must die if there is to be peace. The longer he lives the more damage he does >and opening themselves to a ton of scrutiny

Why do people keep asking that? No shit. I really want to know. You either haven't been paying attention and didn't care, or you are just now leaning what America is about.

"WTF IS GOING ON IN AMERICA?!?!?!" Well, we can dream of want should have been and look at the statistics. But we have what we have now. You could literally write a book on what ifs. What we know: Trump has got to go. For a president to suggest looter her shot is just another example of Trump wanting a civil war. Face it. And who does this all point to. Vladimir Putin. Trump is compromised. He may very well be instructed. 

They cheated 2016. The GOP isolated pocket of the election and pulled it out. They will try this again. This HAS to be a landslide. Otherwise all this shit will get worse and worse. Call it what you want. Easy if us dems and indies don’t get off our asses and vote him out. The 4th Great Industrial Revolution combined with years of businesses pleasing practices that have left the working class behind and a huge increase in wage, my friend.   


40 million have been on unemployment, how many million are behind on rent which is becoming stacked up, in three months we are going to look at an epidemic of evictions, meanwhile Amazon is eating up the job market and simultaneously spending a fortune to see how it can automate away a large percentage of those jobs. Retail jobs are closing nationwide, and food service is working on a percentile of its former glory.  


Trump was a clear sign of the civil unrest by the populace and already existing need and preference to dramatically change the system. Bernie's and Yang's platforms and visibly huge support are confirmation that the working class are fed up and demand change.   


Economic change is absolutely required and society will only get more chaotic in one way or another until it happens. Welcome to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Just wait until next level AI and quantum computers become part of the equation. And Imo Warren doesn't either I'm not for everthing free and a lot people aren't. Can’t believe it’s another shit show of choices....Guess I have to vote for the hair smelling rapist over the racist murderer smh Yeah, and? he found this really narrow crack of daylight to in effect \*always\* be right on the internet and hes laying it down on every bookie in town. My take on this is it's because their they're scarf of trumps bass. If trunk Leos up,and Biden wins in a landslide,that will suck for them as a party. Until 2022,if history repeats itself. In 2016 they for destroyed. Twoyears later they win backthe house netting 63 seats, netted 6 senators and 6 governors. If they turn I trunk,his base turns on them and the party is destroyers (either by not being viable to have a majority in coves and presidential elections or more likely by his base punishing those were eye disloyal to Trump and removed him). I'm not trying to troll and I really hope that I'm wrong about it. But personally, I just have doubts that he'll be able to pull in the numbers. At this point if Trump's base isn't bailing on him now, literally nothing he does will sway them. Joe just needs to start making some serious moves to draw in progressives As if we needed him any less focused on the COVID crisis he will now turn his full attention to Trump vs. Twitter. > That's correct. Except the way Twitter is acting is blurring the line between a provider and a publisher. That's the issue at hand here

No, it's not.  There's no legal difference between the two and there's absolutely no requirement for Twitter or any other website to remain neutral to remain covered by the civil liability protections of 47 U.S. Code § 230. I wonder what he would do with all that free time? Whiney fat prick. Don't worry if they arrest everyone in the area, they might accidentally arrest the bad cop. Yes, now that he has been properly chastened, I’m sure he will begin acting like an adult human. 

Mostly sure. In case anyone was tempted to think it was a couple of bad actors in the Minneapolis gestapo. I see all these stories about how basically no one supports him... 

and yet its still like, "yeah he can still get to 270." Bootlicking blonde Barbie. Democrats largely want reasonable gun regulation,and the radon is Kandahar of all the gun deaths in this country. If anything we need Democrats to spread that theyre worried about a Trump landslide. Get less Trumpers to vote maybe. Prob wont work though, seems to be more apathy on Democratic side. WTactualF is even going on in this country right now. Now I can truly see why trump hired her she's one of those who would defend him if he did shoot someone on 5th Ave. in broad daylight she's a true trump bootlicker for sure. Hamberders. We will beat sleepy Joe quite easily. We all wish it were truth but it's just another trump lie twitter to him is like alcohol is to alcoholic. Nope I’m a Democrat Interesting. TIL. That's correct. Except the way Twitter is acting is blurring the line between a provider and a publisher. That's the issue at hand here The rest of the sane world uproariously applauds Exactly, and under [47 U.S. Code § 230.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230) they would not be liable.  The statute is pretty explicit and I doubt the the House is going to bend over to change this law in Trump's favor.

>(2) No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of—

>(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or

"Otherwise objectionable" is a term big enough to drive a truck through. I'm worried Biden will have him the election somehow. Probably with everyone feeling confident and not showing up to vote > What I cant understand is this hill they are dying on.

Because their party has nothing left to stand on. They positioned themselves as an opposition party and Trump's brand of narcissism feeds the exact contrarian populism that would collapse if any other career politician were in his place. His supporters want chaos and there is currently no replacement for that who will get people to vote R. It's a skeleton party with no convictions or ideals with which to entice voters. They choose trump and party over what was best for our country because they feared for their political future and the wrath of the orange blob for that they are cowards with no balls. Yep.  The Democrats fielded the *only* candidate who couldn't beat Trump in 2016. Both parties went into 2016 bound and determined to lose the election.  The Democrats succeeded. Yes I can agree with 3/4 of your list. 

Of the 196 million people over the age of 21 in the US, approximately 180 are eligible for concealed carry licenses, and >20 million are currently licensed.  This is despite 8 (safely blue) states that are effectively no-issue, and 12 (safely red) states where no license is needed to carry and conceal. 

The overwhelming majority of those 20 million licenses are concentrated in the remaining 30 states, which include **all** of the battleground states.   It is politically absurd to antagonize that voting bloc. It has nothing to do with whether they are neutral or not. It has to do with whether they are subject to lawsuit protections. > Are you aware of the differences of being a publisher vs a platform?

Are you aware that [there's no legal distinction between a publisher and a platform?](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190613/03172142391/once-more-with-feeling-there-is-no-legal-distinction-between-platform-publisher.shtml)  Or that [platforms are not required to be neutral?](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/no-section-230-does-not-require-platforms-be-neutral) KKKops. I mean, Voat exists. But he is the President.  Remember when he had to unblock people? Sadly, all his tweets have been saved.  He could deleted his account right now, and all his bullshit would still exist.  Which, in a way, is really good.  Historians, and law enforcement, will be able to look back and piece together this insanity. Almost like they are covering up, didn't they accuse China of the same thing? Guns. 

Which is absurd, because there is no reason why Democrats should be alienating gun owners. That's why I don't understand why people in the US are happy to sit on their hands. He is literally stripping your freedoms as we watch, and everybody is shaking each other's dicks about impeaching him. Not like that has slowed him down at all. You're on a fast track to a dictatorship. I know trump is batshit eitherway but I wish I knew what my president was even saying but I dont have a twitter... 
Lmfao This post isn't really an attack on protesters at all, but rather the Democratic  city officials that are so fearful of losing their positions of power that they allow the police unions to have such an impact on their decision making. 

I can appreciate the justice Democrats making this an issue and the numerous public defenders fighting to curve police injustice in their cities but their has to be more.

All of the police officers involved in the Murder of Will Floyd had cost that city thousands in lawsuits already. If we don't care about justice we should at least care about the cost to us taxpayers this current iteration of "justice" cost us. How and where did this get decided? Technically he’s using his personal account not the official POTUS one, right. They had their chance to get rid of him. I wish that could be true but if all the spineless senators choose trump and party over country during the impeachment I don't see it happening because they have no balls. Details because, why not:

With the two senators who caucused with the Democrats, Sanders and Lieberman (who had spoken at the 2008 RNC convention to endorse McCain), Democrats had 60 votes from September 25, 2009 when Kennedy's temporary replacement was sworn in until February 4, 2010 when the Republican who won Kennedy's seat in a special election was sworn in.

Before that, Al Fraken's close election (decided by 312 votes out of about 3,000,000) meant that he wasn't sworn in until July 9, 2009.  By then, Kennedy was too sick to really participate in the Senate.

The ACA was passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve during that four-month period. The sooner the better and shove a binky in his big mouth. Twitter is setting a high bar for itself...and opening themselves to a ton of scrutiny. Not sure how they maintain this line.

I don't disagree with it...just think this again politicizes its actions. Please fucking do it! Even worse - any talk of reasonable regulation on the purchase of more guns and they start shrieking about how the "LIb'ruls are comin' fer" *the guns they already own*

Idiots Whiney fat prick. I wish we didnt have to have left and right, just who agrees with what. I know this is pretty much the same, but people get so attacked sometimes if you say you are dem or rep. Even if there are common values between the two they dont care because yOu'Re dEmOcRatIc sCuM. 

On another hand, parties are fine if things actually get done. No more senatoes getting paid from private companies, lobbyists, fillibustering forever on a bill that could help families but doesnt suit 80 yr old Winfreds stock value, and the blatant loss of checks and balances.(I know fillibustering has its place, but to me personall it feels like a tool to stall bills from impacting personal interests.) Our founding fathers must be desperate for a way to come back to life and set fir to the whole government. At least the Japanese didn't have to learn that the US declared war on them through FDR's volley of tweets. If rich is filthy why are people trained up from age one to want to be that way? Well....well they should be. Mabe it will help them with that self-reflection stuff. I hope anyway. OAN and Fox. Facebook. Of course Trump is Biden's greatest asset here. Starting to look like the Minneapolis police need to be rebuilt from the ground up. First time in his life someone tells him no and makes it stick. I wonder if he'll react calmly and use this as a chance to improve his behavior... Smashing! Reporters should just say "Obama wasn't strong enough to delete his Twitter feed". There's probably a Mount Rushmore sized pile of unread reports he could flip through. The four Republican vote-getters that benefit no one:

1. abortion

2. guns

3. religious privilege

4. bigotry I can’t not wait until this criminal is rotting in a cell or even better 6 feet under.   I will celebrate like I never have in my life Biggest sociopathic criminal shit stain on this country’s history ever How about just saying F politics It needs to be a landslide loss to make it harder for Trump to cheat and steal. Especially because of guns. They literally think democrats wanna to ban them AMF

Resign now and maybe the judges will go easy on you

Gonna be in court and/or prison for the rest of your life All Biden hast to do is not interrupt Trump while he’s beating himself What a coincidence "I'd love to get rid of my Twitter account, but they won't let me since I'm being audited" Interesting times! Biden now has many paths to victory.  His VP pick was initially seen as a ‘make or break’ decision but it’s shaping up to be much less critical than that.  Any of his top 3 or 4 options would make a great selection, it just depends on what might be found during the vetting process.   Already I think stuff has cone out about Klobuchar that could be problematic.  

Joe needs to just continue acting like the president this country needs, being the ‘consoler in chief’ while the boy king rages.  The stark contrast, evident daily, says more to the nation than his VP pick. If we had more democracy and everyone voted all that would happen is the GOP would have to adopt some more popular positions. The horror! To be honest, I feel like Trumps base will mostly stay behind him. The theme with the MAGA cult is cognitive dissonance. There are interviews of people being asked these questions on the street and they couldn’t care less about what he does, they’re just glad to have a republican in the White House. The "good" news here is the ignorant orange asshole is incapable of changing his strategy. He is convinced he is infallible so it has to be right. But, they *promised* they wouldn’t do that? Charlie Baker? Or filth. "Jokes on you Mom I don't care if you take my Twitter account away" And a sophisticated system of propaganda, misinformation, and media manipulation developed through decades of study and billions of dollars in investment. They picked trump and party over what was best for our country. Another brain dead trump troll. He's addicted to it just like people are addicted to drugs he would suffer withdrawals. The cult would follow him off the rim of the grand canyon and remember trump himself said he counts on votes from the poorly uneducated
.

Donald Trump: 'I Love the Poorly Educated. We're the Smartest People.'
America, 2016. That's what happens when you're not equipped to think troll Trump troll alert Single issue voters are a huge problem—it’s always either gun rights or anti-abortion. Thanks for bringing up this vital point!  You can’t ever assume any poll is a guarantee for either candidate.  I keep hearing people say “my vote doesn’t matter” but it really does!  We all have to get out and vote (and get everyone we know to vote) if we really want to get this orange monster out of office.  We don’t need a repeat of 2016 where people are either upset about Bernie losing  and they vote for a third party candidate, or people don’t vote at all—that’s a big factor of why Hillary lost in 2016. yeah, this is why even if I hope Biden does win in a landslide, well, I want to be part of it. we thought Clinton would win in 2016 and she didn't so I am not going to let anything put me off of voting come time to vote. He has the most consistent polling lead of a candidate in decades. He's not nailed on to win obviously but these gaffes have literally never hurt him in the past. They can always send another candidate if they want. Imagine if Hillary had taken Sanders as running mate.

Or vice-versa... Real talk tho. God comes down to the earth during a debate. Is he more cool with Joe Biden or Trump as a human being? Yeah please explain. I get that if you were raised that way and stopped paying attention around Reagan you might still be duped. But if you’ve been paying attention since then, you are just voting against yourself if you vote Red and are not filthy rich. I guess all repubs cote that way in CASE they become bajillionaires? People aren't going to know unless they know information like what you have posted. Keep posting, this way people will vote. Worked in 2016, it’ll work in 2020!

While I wish that was all it’s going to take, what we need to do (what we should’ve done a long time ago) is learn and adjust: abolish the electoral college, abolish gerrymandering, and update our processes and procedures for things like: “what to do when voting takes place during a pandemic/state shutdown” instead of changing the dates and locations and methods last minute - for example, I didn’t get to vote in the primaries because I had to “request” a mail-in ballot (as if the government doesn’t know I’m a registered voter in a state that was shut down during the election), which arrived to me one week *after* the due date. There have also been many times my polling place has been inside a giant retirement facility with zero signage or indication that voting is taking place inside, whereas in nicer/richer areas I see flags and banners and people directing traffic and waving signs, etc. There should be a set standard for visibility and accessibility at each polling place, it shouldn’t vary from district to district depending on how difficult Republican politicians want to make it to vote. I think if the EC & gerrymandering were abolished, we went by popular vote only, and we updated our voting processes and procedures, it would be no question who would win the election. But that’s a fairy tale, and we know for a fact republicans are going to cheat (they already are), so what chance for a fair election do we have? And if he does lose, what’s the chance a fair and peaceful transfer of power takes place? Honestly, I kinda suspect Trump is just getting tired of everything. Maybe he'll just leave peacefully when he loses just out of fatigue. Niggers Tirade, because apparently it's not illegal to purposely infect people? Babies. They think they’re “saving babies.” Exactly. His point has nothing to do with Trump, but there was never a supermajority Democratic caucus seated in any quorum. There was *potentially* a supermajority including one or two independents and certain senators who were frequently absent, but that's hypothetical, never actually came about, and the death of Ted Kennedy ended even that hypothetical possibility. If Trump doesn’t continue to try to discount people’s mail-in ballots and other greasy voter-suppression (or unconstitutional media fact-checking censorship) tricks, I think we’ll be okay. I’m 100% confident he’ll cheat though, he doesn’t just *talk* about it.. Go for it. Tick. Tock. *Political party*?! It’s a fucking *cult.* It helps if you’re a white single-issue voter that only cares about abortion and aside from that one topic couldn’t give a shit what happens with anyone other than themselves. I find it very telling that a majority of “Christians” approach politics in that manner, and even more telling is that they share a political party with wannabe confederates, neo-nazis, and KKK members... yet they refuse to address the partisan-to-a-fault superiority complex their party has, aside from outright denial followed by calling the left “divisive” because they have eyes and ears, a conscience, and call a spade a spade. Yes, completely. Flush the toilet and start over. I don’t understand why they didn’t vote to impeach. They could have gotten Pence in and had plenty of time to use their Fox”News” propaganda network to do damage control. I bet secretly most GOP elected officials can’t stand Trump. Why they kept him in power is beyond me. Downvote? We need to get you to top comment instead. What’s he waiting for then? Biden looks boss af in that pic. That’s a commander in Chief! I remember Huntsman during the debates.  I thought he wouldn't be the worst president if he won in the GE.  I was pleasantly surprised by him. Because abortions, apparently. They should just forfeit the whole fucking thing and save everyone the time and money. tRump 😆 is killing himself because he's sooo stupid 😂 Amazing! Follow the money. All roads lead to Putin. Liz would be a good fit. So would Stacy Abrams. At this point, Joe needs to start making moves. He's running a dangerously "Hillary-esque" campaign so far. He needs to start making serious strides to make Republicans see him as a force to be reckoned with. GOP lawmakers are getting scared now, but the general public isn't. We need to start scaring the masses lol. Good point  and I don’t think Biden can draw the progressives so his running mate is absolutely key. I’m leaning toward Elizabeth Warren. I think she is a progressive thinker, brilliant and a strong has a strong backbone.

Joe has a big job on his hands just trying to repair the damaged relationships with our allies. He would be a kinder symbol of healing the country, and I choose to believe that’s possible. But let Elizabeth fight the domestic battles things on healthcare, student loan forgiveness. The progressive fights need to be fought but let’s hope the right person enters that battle. I could be wrong here, but it's my understanding that demographic information, particularly education level and financial affluence, play a huge role in people's understanding of the world around them, and that ultimately informs their own personal ethos and ideology. Therefore, you could intuit that areas with institutions of higher learning, which generally exist in places with concentrated populations would feel a certain way about things, and those coming from a very different background might feel another. “Gretchen Whitmer in her red dress part II” Like an old John Wick. He's switching to Gab. I would debate that Obama was a more attractive candidate than Hillary. And Biden helped Obama. Kaine was baggage for Hillary. And Biden may be more attractive than Hillary if he picks a good running mate. Remember how Sarah Palin blew it for McCain. Biden also whooped Paul Ryan in the debate. Lord willin' an' the creek don't rise. And guns An emotionally charged argument disingenuously brought to by the very same people who would tell their opponents to never let emotions dictate political decision making. To be fair, the U.S. wouldn't be #1 in the world for virus deaths and infections if Trump weren't a Russian tool who won an election with a hostile government's financial and online support.  Whatever you think about Hillary, she would have at least been somewhat competent.    

To even compare them as similar objects of your hate says a lot about you. True, they get anxious about her winning debates too. Debatable. At least previous presidents behaved presidential. Reince Priebus now looks like a choir boy. Yet one party is dominated by uneducated whites. Like an alcoholic saying they’d love to get rid of alcohol. The one thing Trump has said that I wholeheartedly agree with him on He’s leading the polls by a good margin and Trump lost the pop by three plus million in 2016. He hasn’t gained one supporter. And everyone else is sick of Trump’s day after day baby tantrum. Every time I get incredibly angry about some shit the GOP is pulling, Romney comes outta left field and it stuns me. Like goddamn it, Romney. Stop it with your rationality and even tempered responses and just let me hate all of you! 

You know what 2020 needs next? For Romney to be like “Fork this. I’m joining Amash and dropping out of the forking GOP.” And then he downs a can of Coke. Or.... Maybe choose a slogan that is not directed anti-trump only....

Negative publicity is still publicity. Biden needs to win progressive support to beat trump. 

He also needs a plan for defeating Covid (and she has a plan for everything). And he needs her to  attack and take the fight to Trump, because Biden seems unable to do that. Epic edit. Enjoy my 50 coins! "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel" - Samuel Johnson Not young, but Romney. He's the only (small) chance they would have to legitimately win. Good. Per your post:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) This. I’ve heard plenty of people on the right say that Trump is just a useful idiot.  But that’s because they’re idiots too. Just another one of his lies. He would not love it. The GOP has missed its “Joseph Welch” moment. Welch was an attorney who finally ended the devastating career of Joseph McCarthy in the 1950’s.. “Until this very moment Senator, I do not believe that I gauged your cruelty or recklessness... you have done enough! Have you no decency sir!?!?” I am paraphrasing- but he was finally seen as the fraud and coward that he was. The GOP turned on Nixon (eventually); where did that GOP go? Gone. Sold their souls indeed. Thank you. Just Vote. Twitter should fact check this obvious lie. Then fucking do it Bidden should just play on how much better looking and stylish he is then Trump. It'll get Trump super pissed and he'll throw a major tantrum. If you go after Trump with rational objective facts it slides right off him cause he doesn't give a shit, but drag him into a game of "mines bigger then yours" and he'll get manic like a five year old on a playground. Who is gloating and what are they gloating about? 

We’ve passed the 100,000 deaths mark with this god awful pandemic so who in their right mind would even use the word gloat today. Abortion. When you view abortion as killing babies as a form of birth control (I don't, but that's what I was taught growing up) it makes it really easy to justify all the wrong things your side are doing. I appreciate your comment and opinion here. I agree completely; the destruction and threat to the constitution is real. I just want our laws and rules to matter. I also agree that I always felt the past presidents and even politicians were at least human. Some of the GOP senators come across as supervillains almost. That is the best idea he's ever had. He probably stoll it from, you know, everyone else! You're exactly right.  They will use every trick they can come up to keep people from voting.  They are blatantly doing it every day and it's all of them, not just Trump. If it were up to me, Trump would have been booted from the white house in February. I don't think that his base is going to be swayed by any of that though. I think he has his core supporters, and Joe hasn't been able to draw in progressives enough. It's not too late by any means and I really hope I'm wrong, but I just don't think he's gonna get Democrats out voting. Let's centimate them then! Don't forget religion, sexism, and gay phobia I’m afraid of polls. Because of the his fast and commanding response to Covid ( /s) or his dramafest fight with Twitter as our country reaches 100,000 deaths? What are you doing here, dude? I mean, I dont mind some logical discussion, but provide some evidence to back up your claim. Otherwise, it's just trolling. And if you're being sarcastic, I apologize. None that I'm wearing *blackjack

Signed,

A fellow Futurama nerd Don’t just pin it on Republicans, both party’s have ignorant people. Huh funny, I was just thinking the opposite Funny, my great aunt and her children are Democrats because their parents were Democrats and their great grandady was a Democrat yadayadayada. Anyone can fall into that mindset retard. Evil rich whites tricking the dumb poor ones Alright, you must organize to get other people to vote. Has South Carolina made any moves towards mail in ballots for the election? The eyepatch guy Sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong Is a BBQ where you tell your staff to set up a bunch of cold fast food in your office? If not then you’re right. As a moderate, I try to see each issue on its merit rather than “My team says...” However- I believe that the current GOP needs to pay a serious political price for enabling this dangerous buffoon. A heavy, heavy toll that they will hopefully never forget. I have voted Republican before, but I don’t think I can ever do that again. Where did our honor go? Our values? Sure Obama and Bush made mistakes (Bush more than many) but they were good men, who tried to do what they thought was right. Trump cultists haven’t budged. They love Trump even more now that he’s killed people with his lies and misinformation. They think he’s a hero and they’re “warriors” saving the economy from democRATs. Vote. Vote. For the love of God vote! For the Midwest in rural small towns, it’s because it is “supposed” to guarantee less taxes and less government involvement. When you live in BFE, you think you can do just fine without the government (obviously not). They’re basically 16 year olds who never grew up This would be one of the best senate elections to win. Graham, McConnell, Collins: gtfo. US Law.  He cannot delete it, it is part of public record now and will be saved. That's fine, in a few short months, we will be happy to take possession of that account from you seeing as it is the official Presidential Twitter. Jon Huntsman.

I'm pretty liberal, but I would vote for Jon Huntsman in a heartbeat. Trump Twitter: it’s like Trump university but without so many characters. Yeah Right 👹

&#x200B;

Just do it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🙏🙏🏻🙏🏽🙏🏾🙏🏿🙏🏻 They need arrested as a terrorist party.

They're not a political party. They haven't been for 40 years. Landslide? Joe is damaging his campaign every time he opens his mouth. How is he going to debate when Freudian slips keep happening when cameras are on him? I mostly see posts that republicans are worried about an impending Biden landslide on democrat subs. This news while uplifting can unconsciously demotivate us to vote because ‘it’s in the bag’ so to speak.   I don’t know why we believe anything republicans say and truly, anything that could demotivate democrat voters to vote would surely be in their election playbook. 

OP no disrespect, we want to hear good news, but I felt so extremely whipped in 2016 that this similar message now coming from the republicans, that they are ‘worried’, is beginning to seem disingenuous on their part. Maybe it’s conspiracy theory, but they have a solid history of spreading propaganda. 

Downvote me to hades, if you must. Did someone say court reform? 15 person SCOTUS; add extra members to every federal court. Most importantly, don't forget to make DC and PR states in the process or else the dough won't rise! He couldn’t govern a freakin’ BBQ. What’s stopping him, is he too stupid? I feel like this is somewhat similar in every are though, that’s why most blue states stay blue and same for the red states. Is there some reason democratic voting people don’t share this tradition? He’s to much of a coward to follow through on that statement.  Just wait, he won’t do it. Nope. Not buying it.

Watch it again. He immediately says:
 
“sure sure” translated: didn’t follow or else wasn’t listening

Then: points to windows (architectural feature)
“There is an openness, but there is nobody out there. There is a certain openness but as you can imagine there is nobody out there.”

Entirely literal take on a metaphorical question. 

Guy is not someone who ever says anything funny or even thinks as things as funny, so nobody is buying that.

Basically don’t keep attributing intelligence to his words.

Edit. I feel kinda shocked now. Do you not know what a metaphor? It’s saying one thing on the surface which makes sense but the same phrase also refers to something deeper.

Sample. “Thats one small step for man..one giant leap for mankind.”

Surface level: talking about literally about first man to step and then leap across the moon surface

Metaphor:  man landing and waking on the moon for the first time a species was represented by a tiny actions. A man stepping foot on the moon. That step represented a huge leap for science and our understanding of our place in the universe.

Certain words have double meanings and so the metaphor works on a surface level and a metaphoric level. That’s why they are powerful. Kinda like poetry really. Anybody. Consider who they chose for their candidate last time. They’re not exactly into credentials and experience. I’m gonna set up my own twitter! With hookers, and gambling! Because their patents and grandparents and great grandparents voted republican. It is the exact same allegiance as supporting the home football team. It doesn’t matter what happens in reality you support your team.  For most people, political dealings are too difficult to understand.  

I am amazed everyday by how ignorant people are Can we talk about how badass Biden looks in aviators and a black mask? Let just vote this time and overwhelm the election . Remove this orange füher from office. Common America it’s time 🇺🇸 This is quite possible the best description I have seen on Reddit. I salute you. Ah yes, pre-gloating.  A tactic that always returns victory, just ask Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. The blueprint is “Donald Trump is a fucking asshole and any senator that supports him is an asshole by proxy” Apolitical and herd minded.  People vote for and with what they're social spheres are, and dont care enough to investigate politics... also single vote issue and "god." Even if trump wins with that margin, he still loses. 

I mean, other than the stupid fucking electoral college, which means that's not true. Brokeback here is no cowboy. All hat and no horse. A windshield cowboy. Yeah I don't know.  I'm sure they could find ANYONE to be their patsy. >**some young, not racist guy that might look and sound better than Biden.**

And who pray tell would **that** be?! Haley doesn't work. Who else? Yeah they don't understand that this guy floated highly under-qualified ppl who happily lick his boot all day. Into one of the most important dmfoundations of our democracy. He's basically already won and our countries fucked. I get worried with these type of articles as the critique of politicians covid-19 responses can go both ways.  

Cuomo is getting a lot of heat for his actions.  We can't call for trumps head without Cuomo going down too. What I cant understand is this hill they are dying on.  They could right now, impeach Trump and convict him.  They can say, "We gave him every chance, but he never learned."  They can claim he was never a "true conservative," and then nominate some young, not racist guy that might look and sound better than Biden.  They could all stand there and say they "put country first" and people would buy it.  I think there are enough swing voters that would vote for a guy like that, or a Niki Haley type...Can you imagine those mother fuckers get a woman in first? Biden is not good in debate, he is not good on the campaign trail. He looks amazing because Trump is such a fucking idiot, but up against a suave, smart, attractive Republican (male or female) it would be hard.  So why are they willing to end it all right now for Trump?   



Because they're going to cheat. They've been saying witch hunt for a while, I say we gove em what they want and we investigate every person who sided with trump during the impeachment till they are sucked dry, all at their expense for once too, not mine. Hmmm go for it you asshat Harris for AG! Rasicsm, fear, and utter fucking stupidity I fucking hope so. Dayum, Trump took MO by 18 points in 16 So it's like diet progressive, I'll take that over faccism. Seriously,what is stopping him? Yes and the joke that he doesn’t need a place to hide from those issues since he has security guards for protection.

This joke makes perfect sense, you just took trumps response as literal because you want him to look bad.

There’s plenty of retarded shit that he’s said and you choose this? Cmon now lmao > Yes I dislike her policies too 

well atleast that part of your argument is honest. your selective outrage is kinda sad tbh Biden doesn’t have a chance Well they're certainly not acting like it. Another example would be pushing for ceo pay to be tied to employee pay like they do in Israel..  If the ceo makes more then 40 times the lowest payed employee hit them with a big ol tax hike till they fix it The Federalist Society is the real enemy of the people. *Trump, Graham, and McConnell. South Carolinian here. I will do everything in my power to make sure Jaime Harrison represents South Carolina in the U.S Senate in 2021. I mean what else would he do? Govern? Nah. Ben Gazi! I really don't understand why people vote Republican unless you're filthy rich. The FBI ran interference for him.  Without Comey, Clinton wins by 6 points or more. Preaching to the choir won't help anything. That's why Republicans are against people voting. buttery males... No, decimation was to count off and kill 1:10.  They didn't eliminate 90% of their military. I'd be happy if 10% of Republicans lost their seats across the board.  That would be 20 House members, 5 Senators, and hundreds of state legislators, plus Trump. They should have thought of that in February when they covered for him. Its just a simple example of why these senior citizens are out of touch with younger generations there are many others but i guess if you where happy with late 90s early 2000s  center right dems style of government more power to ya There's a lot of that going around and I'm hoping to see it fail spectacularly. I've gotten fliers from both republican candidates running for my congressional district and they're both full of Pro Trump rhetoric. This. The worst thing we can do is assume this is in the bag. Do people not understand that there won't be the huge backlog of vacancies like Trump had? If that ever happens again, it's highly unlikely to happen in your lifetime. Along with most of his family. “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it.” - Lindsey Graham That's what the GOP thought during the 2016 election as well after the pussygrab video came out. But the deplorables just stuck with Trump's scam. I fear the bar has been lowered way down into hell this time around. I beleive the original Roman definition is take 1 tenth and make them kill the other 9 tenths.  This was done as a punishment for cowardly leadership and running away from battle.

&#x200B;

This leaves only 10 percent left not a mere reduction by ten percent. I think grieving over the death of his son, as well as being told by Obama not to run, are pretty good reasons. We sure can! We can dream though. :D Really it would be like heaven not to hear him ranting day after day. But like you said he'd never do it where else would he spread his lies. Its mostly because hillary was more popular than Biden, Obama, Trump, or even Sanders today.  People just dont like her when she defeats men in campaigns. We'd love that too.

&#x200B;

As if he's gonna give up all that attention. Without Twitter and golf he would have nothing to do. We would love that too. Just another lie he would have to be committed if he couldn't tweet what a complete moron. etymology fallacy.

awesome is not a synonym for awful

nosy does not mean pertaining to a nose The whole spineless senate for starters. Oh god yes. Graham is a coward. As I have said before we need to come out in record number{ oh wait someone called me out because I said that} They said you mean get your absentee ballots nit pick or what. We can't take things for granted like we did in 2016. and that's the truth I think it's because they thought they owed Hillary a chance in 2016. They were that way before Trump, they just don't bother to hide it anymore. As long as people VOTE he will! Not yet. Steady, boys and girls. Vote. Someone should permanently suspend the impotus! Tim Scott is one of your two senators, and is not up for re-election, but the other senator from your state, Lindsey Graham, is, and voting him out would be a wonderful thing, if that’s your political persuasion. In an alternate timeline Trump would of called on Biden to resign from a few hundred deaths from covid for the entire pandemic. Just like it's ok for Kelly Ann Barkway and brainless Barbie Mcenany can vote by mail what hypocrites. Got to have that phone how else would he spread all his lies what a total moron trump is. He couldn't lead a horse to water much less lead our country. IF, and this is a big IF, covid 19 never happened and in the aftermath Trump hadn’t blown it off for golf with a Twitter disaster and more concern about Twitter than American lives, if things had been rolling along like they did after the impeachment, she would be going hard core on the dems! All that did happen though so now she has an  “across the aisle approach “ lol That’s what they said about BUSH 2. He was so bad it made it “hard for a white man to run for President.” 
Don’t underestimate his followers. They are motivated and are true believers. It would have been a 1964-style blowout too. I understand he had his reasons but the truth is I’ll never completely forgive him for not running. Well they haven't been able to shut him up in three and a half years. So they deserve whatever they get. Can't wait. Yes I dislike her policies too, but bilking mourners is a level of immorality I just won’t tolerate. 

Thankfully she won’t win the primary, so it’s completely moot. lol but again why? we live in a Biden/Trump world the only thing we should care about is policy. Just admit you don't want her policies that's atleast being honest. Generally, extremism stars with jokes. Trump should get 3rd degree burns from that scorcher. I feel it is more rude to intentionally lie to someone. I’ll take a candidate who didn’t make her living scamming bereaved people out of money for the chance to talk to ghosts. Yea baby! Liz all the way! Let’s goooooo and? she has better, more popular policies and is also polling above Collins (despite little name-rec) so either will get you there. Just in one case we get better policy. Biden would have beaten Trump in 2016. Decimate means to reduce by 10%. That's the "deci-" prefix. 

They need a lot more than that gone. Wouldn't it be funny if Hillary just ran against him again?

She’d only need one campaign slogan:

“Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” The only good trump is a dead trump. I think my congressperson would be Cunningham? I forget if Tim Scott is a rep or a senator. Google likely has the answers. Ok thug can't take it out of the.... and only criminals don't like cops!!!! So weed is why thats a good reason, lol. Are you a troll pal I wasn't talking to you if you didn't notice and I can't stand 3 word comments that add nothing to the conversation! More and more of the same from the GOP. When your not in control of the senate and trump has the last word makes it kind of hard . And it's not time to live in the past we can only change things come November with a Biden win and take back control of the senate and being pessimistic is not going to help anything. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/ I have been right here watching the same thing so pls don't feel you need to educate me. I said "they hate her, they will EXPLOIT" I never said the democrats should climb in bed with wall street. They (WS) are afraid of her, which in my mind is a good thing, but they will pull out all the stops to prevent her ascent to a higher position. Even with the bald truth that wall street has very little to do with economic health and employment, people still think stockmarket up= good for employment. Reality will set in when jobs don't come back, but they will still believe the stockmarket can fix that. They (WS&RP) will make sure to paint it as EW will hinder economic recovery. Done talking. We have different opinions which is fine but nothing is gained by belaboring this. Hagd. I'm having a hard time seeing the relevance of the text of the EO to Trump's individual relationship with Twitter. If anything, it looks like it could potentially be a factor in a hypothetical lawsuit, but that would be highly unlikely to even reach the first hearing in the  time remaining under the Trump administration. What's the intended effect of the EO, and how could it benefit Trump? This  40% floor is still fucking depressing That's because you don't usually understand what you're reading. We had a super majority at the time of Obamacare. We lost all of it because we didn't defend ourselves. We didn't defend Obamacare. The idea behind a federal republic is a compromise between representation of the people and representation of the member states. What do you believe that President Trump has done, that should engender violence? I don't like him, and I don't approve of many of his political positions, and I fully believe that he has acted unethically at several junctures, but I cannot articulate one specific thing that I believe could or should be addressed by violence. Even though I advocate for his impeachment and removal from office, I cannot cite a specific law that he has broken.

As for the system being broken, I don't necessarily disagree, but you haven't named the country whose government is free of corruption, or whose politics are not influenced by wealth and capital. She is one of the best things to come out of the 2018 election. You can buy shares of "Will Trump complete his first term?" *"No"* for 11 cents on the dollar on PredictIt. I spot a trump troll. We just passed a sign in the grass that said, "This way to the ovens." Sure. So it’s saying the office is a metaphor for the role. Hiding in this case is not from an assailant but from things like scrutiny, responsibility, polls, criticism, oversight, Congress, the press, etc.

The saying is one of those double meanings saying which is why it is powerful. It’s not a basic architectural comment. Hope that helps. Na na na na
Na na na na
Hey hey hey
Goodbye IMO Nahendra Modi, Prime Minister of India is what right-wing Republicans think Trump is. Ultra-nationalist, pro-state religion (Hinduism/Christianity), anti-Muslim minorities, gets stuff done to improve the country without giving a fuck. 

The difference is Modi actually has a super high approval rating because he's smart and actually believes in his mind he is improving India. Compared to Trump who does and says whatever he feels like at the given moment and knows that sabotaging democracy is the only way for Republicans to keep power. Good thing we don’t live in a dictatorship Wall Street just had 4 years of compete gov ownership and trump letting them do anything they want. 

And this is where we ended up. 

This isn't the same situation. Unfuck the Senate! Too bad Republicans will never allow such to happen. Gotta keep those Conservative judges moving on the conveyer belt just like good Ol’ Mitch McConnell loves to say. The Supreme Court is our last hope but I expect they will come down on strictly partisan lines. Then Trump knows he can literally do anything he wants and no one will stop him. He can then start putting enemies in jail -- or worse. It was silly of us to think we were any different and that it couldnt happen here. Great! Honestly Joe is seeming so out of touch repeating the mistakes that Hillary did..  If he dosnt atleast come out for legalizing weed witch is a massive no brainer idk if ill vote for anyone this time around..  He seems like he is talking just to the 55+ crowd might as well let boomers finish the carnival side show they seem to want to turn this country into at this point i literally have nothing left to lose anyways But the alternative is that lies, conspiracy theories, and trolling by bad actors flourish.

Now that we have one political movement in particular, the far right nationalists, willing to plant lies and conspiracy theories; doing nothing is not an option.  Otherwise we are just handing our democracy over to the authoritarians while we drown in our principles.

I think a more complex approach is warranted. Oh good. What about your congressperson? And your state representatives? Are they up for re-election? And on and on down the ballot. If only they had a chance to remove him.... Can you explain the metaphor to me? Because from what I understand, trumps response makes absolute sense. Why would he need to hide when he has secret agents? Couldn't of said it better myself. They had three and a half years to do something about him.  They didn't.  Instead, they fully transformed into the party of really stupid traitorous greedy racist democracy haters. I did put in a statement that I do not think that free speech is being violated, but rather it’s an issue of control over information and narrative. 

Other than that, yeah I don’t have too much of a problem with social media shutting down blatant hate speech granted they set up clear rules on it that users understood ahead of time. The issue is, we have to assume they will always act in good faith. I don’t trust that. I think googles power is the most troubling, and I don’t trust them for a second not to abuse it. Republicans need to be decimated as a political party. Without a doubt First, let's clear up the "free speech" argument:

The 1st amendment protects citizens from having their speech restricted (with some exceptions such as "obscenity") by the government.  Private entities are free to restrict any speech they choose.  The 1st amendment has nothing to do with private entities.

We have seen the right wing weaponize the free speech argument in order to demand that they be given unlimited access to all social media platforms to push their extremist agenda.  There is no obligation for social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and Youtube to allow hate speech to thrive unrestricted.  There is no obligation for private individuals to tolerate hate and intolerance.  White supremacy, male supremacy or any other hate movements aren't entitled to equal billing, equal air time and oxygen to grow on media platforms, universities, or anywhere else that is not part of the Government.  It isn't just another legitimate opinion.  It's dangerous.

I think the idea that we should just allow hate speech to flourish, recruit and grow on these social media platforms because if we don't, we are inviting all speech to be restricted is a false choice.  These social media platforms can restrict hate speech.  They should restrict hate speech.  Because marginalized people are the victims of violence and discrimination and social media has just served to pour gasoline on the fire.  

As for fact checking:

We are seeing the destruction of democracy by bad faith actors who push lies, and conspiracy theories.  We are seeing it being weaponized in such ways that it is tearing this country apart.  Encouraging people to ignore social distancing, wearing masks, and putting people's lives in danger.  We have seen a liar and a cheat get elected to the presidency.  And thrive on lies and conspiracy theories.  It is getting dangerous and it is destructive to the future of civilized society. 

Simply doing nothing because of fear that it might be utilized unfairly is not an option anymore.

If these social media sites refuse to intervene, then social media sites will come along that do restrict hate speech and do extensive fact checking, and most people will migrate to these sites leaving the social media sites who refuse responsibility to fade in popularity.

On the other hand, the power that these sites have to push their own interests and agenda is a fair and serious concern.  I don't know what is going to happen in the future.  But doing nothing is not an option.  We have to find a solution that allows people to continue to connect and express ideas, but does not allow hate and lies to flourish unchecked. I agree this is a big deal. It’s vital that we can trust news sources. I liked the Seattle Times on Facebook but now I have to see comments from people who are in a whole different reality where Covid19 is just a scam, Inslee is out to become a dictator, wearing a mask means you’re a sheep, etc. So far Trump has declared war on the news, the mail and social media. It’s part of a disinformation campaign and it’s scary. The big prob is the folks they are going to infect. I have no issue with her qualification and never intended to dispute that fact. Wall street hates her and they will exploit that. With the shape the country will be in financially jobs and economy will be a big factor. HC for all her skill, qualification etcetcetc failed because she was polarizing, I feel the same is true with EW. At the end of the day that matters. Really? I wish I could agree with you. But remember: Trump didn't win the popular vote. The primary ideal behind a democracy is "one person, one vote". That doesn't exist in the US. Because some people's votes matter more than others, 3 and a half MILLION people's votes were essentially thrown away. It's small wonder that people stay home.

And the reality is that even if people do vote in numbers high enough to elect a democrat, it will STILL be someone who accepts corporate PAC money, it will STILL be someone who games the system, and it will STILL be someone who bribes his/her political rivals with promotions. Hey, It's you, being really dumb. Yes yes yes    Collins is a wasted sham of a cause. I mean I know my senator candidates 100% this. In DC the goal is power as opposed to NYC where it typically is money. 


Source: I grew up in DC and after 8 years living across the country have returned to this beautiful city. Unfortunately, for many in this city (mostly focused on those around the Cap Hill neighborhood - duh haha!), power is the goal. They often come from wealthy families and all ready have comfortable lives. It is, but nobody is keeping him from saying anything, just they are adding more info. I'm surprised to see the Lincoln project going after moscow mitch.  You'd think a group of republicans would be cheering him on.  His current court packing run is going to stimey anything any Democratic President/Congress tries to do.  For decades. Ok. Good. 

Your government is made of many many layers, the president is the cherry on top, but you have your representatives in Washington who have a great deal of influence. Your senators and congresspeople.

Then you have your state government, your governor and your state senators.

And then your local government, mayor, councilman. It all depends on where you live. 

If you are voting for the first time it’s good to get in the habit of studying who else is going to be on your ballot. It’s not just going to be a Biden vs Trump thing, there’s bound to be elections “lower down on the ballot”, or “down ballot”. 

Can you get in touch with your board of elections online and see if you can view a ballot. Then start looking up to see where the people on it stand on the issues that matter to you. Yeah, I read it after I typed that. Good article. Gives me hope, though Russia probably hasn't kicked misinformation crap into high gear yet. Warren is tough too. Both are close in my book but warren might pull in a few more progressives. Not sure kamala makes biden's tent bigger. It's definitely a justified tirade.

And it should be called republican bioterrorism She knows her policy in and out. She takes strong stands and can reach out to the left. 

Her baggage is that she told the truth about being a native American... lol Expand why would it be bad? Thats insane. 

And the headline shouldn't be the tirade, but the why he is doing it. 

"State gop exposes other representatives to Covid-19 inentionally without warning." ...I dont know what that means I keep reading that people perceive her as a “cop” due to being a prosecutor and maybe that would be an issue. Progressives will have their day in the sun.

That's what happens when you're up before dawn. Good. Put some liberals on the courts. Her campaign is touting her bipartisan credentials.

They're completely unaware that nobody is buying their bullshit anymore. And that’s not even his biggest problem- Trump is about to lose his personal freedom. Perhaps AG Harris Can take care of that

This asshole needs to be locked up until he’s a skeleton IMO Kamala was be his best choice she's one tough cookie and that's needed . It's literally patriotic to vote out Republicans. Get involved, donate, and keep pushing everyone! that is not what you're doing. Love it. It's been years since I've stopped listening to people who claim to be willing to bet on something, but won't accept the offer when you can make it possible. Democrats are terrible at defending their policies because they don't think it is necessary to defend common sense. Because of this they can't hold on to power for more than 8 years. For sure start doing that and before you know it his buddies Kim and Putin decide they had better get in on the action. I give Romney some credit. Was most likely given his marching orders right from the top. I feel the same way.  Absolutely useless. Great article. Inslee is a true leader. Trump has not shown one ounce of compassion for the people who have died from the virus. Pretending it doesn’t exist is not what an intelligent leader does Go Maine go! Did you read the article?  It had funny "don't get complacent" warning labels throughout!  :) As much as I wish this were true, it’s not.  The GOP have gerrymandered, cheated, packed the courts, etc. and it will take a generation or more to undo all the damage.  In the meantime, we’ll get the thrashing of a dying rural white base, who would rather destroy the country, than allow PoC to be more equal. I bet Collins is “concerned” for real now Don't get complacent! This guy is out here worrying about people holding him accountable for his trash instead of trying to solve the pandemic. His is going to fucking RUIN this country. Death to all Republicans. They are beyond trash. Wow I can’t believe the girl who wrote the Hunger Games is losing Do you know who’s in your down ballot races? Those are just as important, maybe even more important. McSally lost in a midterm to an openly bi-sexual Democratic woman.  There is no fucking way she can beat a white space hero. All I want is for a reporter to ask Collins after she loses if she "learned her lesson." Every republican is reprehensible.


Every. Single. One. Wouldn't it be nice to streamline this process for arguments on reddit and other social media platforms? So people could choose their own odds and wager directly against their adversary. Remember the crowdpac fundraiser when she voted for that knucklehead on the bench Sweet has never held public office, but has worked as an herbal healer who performed seances for her clients. 

I’d like to win this election. I pray this is the truth , from God's mouth to your ears And her BK performance, she is a fake.

And I don't mean Burger King i guess after killing 100k of us by incompetence, what's another 100m by intention. I feel sorry for you. "Not suffering fools lightly" is *not* a "weird mindset". Unlike what the democrats have been doing for Trumps entire presidency. Biden did well because super tuesday is heavily weighted towards southern states. Those states have large black populations. Black voters came out strongly in favor of Biden for two reasons. First, black voters tend to be more moderate so they voted for the moderate candidate. Second, Biden's history with Obama lent him familiarity and credibility with black voters. The southern states on super tuesday is also exactly where Hillary pulled ahead of Sanders in 2016. How many people have to die before this stupid frigging guy is removed?...every republican that voted not to remove him during impeachment has to bear that cross, hopefully history will not be kind to them. I still think she is too polarizing, as unfair a characterization as that is, she still has a lot of baggage. I get that the choice of a woman is what they "think" people want but idk.....I think man or woman, the best person for the job should always be the choice. Ahhh I didn’t pick up on the reference, but well done lol I mean agree with this but it was more poking fun at her constant “grave concerns” about trump and then doing absolutely nothing about it. Also her comment that Trump “learned a lesson” thru the impeachment process. He did learn a lesson: that he can do whatever the fuck he wants and no one will hold him accountable. She seems like the obvious choice to me.  A VP might have to serve as president too, and either Biden or Warren would trounce Trump this fall.  Together, he hasn't got a chance.  Confidence in Warren's ability to serve as necessary is probably pretty high. Probably not. If she’s voted out she has all of the right connections to stay in DC and be a lobbyist or something. 

But yeah in general she’s stopped fooling Maine with her “across the aisle” bs that originally got her elected. I agree. I dont think people realize just how bad it could get. You can't argue with that. The thought of Collins getting the boot after the bullshit she's pulled the past few years has me super excited. She's gambled her entire legacy and political future on Trump and that is going to cost her everything. That wouldn't surprise me. On the other hand replace him with Pence... Any means necessary. Every now and then you see how they really feel. This is one of those. Get Fucked Collins I knew you'd say that. Power is the goal, money is the perk. In your case, yes Ann Coulter made the comment that Trump is purposely trying to give the Senate over to the Democrats. His actions lately make me wonder if that’s true. He is totally off the rocker right now. That's it, isn't it? Belief over reason. Depends on who you choose to believe. I hope she and several other republican senators get voted out But can she run for president? She seems more stable. Same thing, but when law enforcement does it it's called investigating; when CIA does it it's called spying. Either way it's legal. This has zero to do with the first amendment. Jfc read up on publisher vs platform before you post. Twitter isn't a platform anymore. Otherwise they'd have to be fact checking everyone. Forcibly remove his entire fascist regime immediately. FBI, CIA, National Guard, Capitol Police, U.S. Marshalls I don't care how just make it happen. North Carolina here. I think Biden will take the urban and surrounding areas but rural will go GOP, pretty much what happened in 2016. However the state’s population growth is in the urban centers while there has been some rural population decline. 

Don’t know whether or not this will be enough to turn the state, who knows. If Biden comes up with a rural platform and actually visits this demographic it would go a long way I think. You say this like we don't already have them now. Joe Biden hasn’t said one thing that makes me not want to vote for him. I support his entire agenda. I want to be clear that I am enthusiastically voting FOR Joe Biden. Fact:Spied on Trump campaign .  you have a weird mindset if you don't take someone seriously unless they bet their hard earned money on an election prediction. people don't go for that because it doesn't make sense, not because they are slithering cowards. you on the other hand might have a gambling addiction. Fact: FBI investigated Russian involvement in elections, phone tapped Russian ambassador talking with American- all legal. Generally they redact the American's name. In this case his identity (Flynn) was material to the story, so they didn't redact it in the report to Obama and others authorized to know. All legal. Another Trump nothingburger. These guys all want to be reelected. Trump has turned everything and everyone into something political and the sad part is most of them don't have balls enough to say no. Same goes for the CDC and some of the members of empty-suit Pence's coronavirus team for one Birx she seems to timid to disagree with trump and sometimes dodges questions where she knows she would be put on the spot. And same goes for Jerome Adams he seeks the presidents approval and of course don't forget pinhead Alex Azar who screwed up since day one right along with trump. I think it's more about who we are voting against and what that individual represents... I never said he was that conservative, just that between the two, Biden and Sanders, Sanders is the more leftist.  Biden is a solid moderate Dem.  He's not my first choice (voted for Sanders this year, and in 2016) but I'm planning to vote for him in the fall.  #runupthescore Not accusations anymore. Fact. Things will change now. For sure. They got him Biden isn’t as conservative as Sanders supporters like to make him out to be. What Biden is is a “mainstream Democrat” which means that as the party evolves, so does he. And that’s just fine because whatever we can get a Democratic Congress to send him, he will sign it. He was like my 7th or 8th choice but I have never in my life been so excited to vote for someone. Good Democrats understand self-defense. The top reason is that there was no vandalism with the reopener protests. At least that's true in my state. I can guarantee it would not have went well if people started breaking windows and vandalizing police property during the reopen protests. Dividing Democrats *and* violent rhetoric? That'll be a "no thanks" from me. If Trump causes the GOP to implode he may inadvertantly have a hand in making America great. John Dickerson is great. Check him out on the Political Gabfest podcast. 

This interview was batshit crazy tho. This clip doesn’t even show my favorite part where John says the quote about the Oval Office not having corners so there is nowhere to hide.

(This is a....Metaphor)

Trump takes this literally and says, “yeah but as you can see we have secret agents” or some crap like that. He only thinks literally about corners. Hahahahah

This was the moment I realize what kind of intellect was leading the free world. This is not good. National polls are nice, but the important ones are in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, and the other swing states. Biden could win majority by a huge margin, but still lose the delegates. 

Adopt a state, find out ways you can help locally, find out what you can do and what days are important

https://votesaveamerica.com/ Is there evidence of large numbers of registered Republicans changing party affiliation? Open primary results alone don't support your hypothesis. Isn’t that their entire platform? I hate seeing these polls.   While I want Susan Collins to lose big time I think polls like these attract Republicussian attention and efforts towards the specific election I'm not challenging you, but the point wouldn't be whether the bet makes sense. It's a way of demonstrating to others that the person actually believes in the position to some degree, as opposed to just trolling, as is often the case.

If you were saying Collins would lose, I would invite you to make some money while I match you dollar for dollar. You (not "you" obviously) would lose more than I gain, which makes it different from a straight odds bet, but there's no convenient way to broker that kind of bet between random people. Predictit at least gives one mechanism that can work, more or less.

Nobody ever goes for it. Vote. 

Vote. 

Vote. 

Vote until it hurts. 

Then vote again. That's funny. I'm not slithering away hahaha I just don't see much sense in the bet considering how strong my position is!! I have often invited people who make confident claims about political outcomes to put their money where their mouth is, and make the bet on the relevant proposition on PredictIt. The offer is for them to do that, and share the receipt, and I will do the same.

No one has ever taken me up on the offer. Some have attacked the integrity of predictit claiming they manipulate the results somehow, but most of them just slither away as soon as it becomes possible to put something tangible on it. I'm pretty sure Russia will be providing most of that for free like last time. I feel like if they were gonna do that they would have voted someone like Bloomberg. You may not like Biden, he isnt my first choice either, but he's still not as bad as what we could have had. Honestly. I'm gonna be a first time voter and I can think of no better time to be voting than to be voting Trump out. To a large extent he is representative of Americans as individuals and the society as a whole. Our current situation in humanity can be characterized as precarious at best. It seems clear that we as Americans as well as the world on the whole are headed toward some pretty dark days as a result of global warming alone. I would go so far as to say we are odds on even that 2016 was the last peaceful transition of government. At some point global warming will cause a major crop failure and that will come at the same time of year as a virus spike. If it happens this year the writing is clear but the truth is we don’t have many autumns left. There’s also Betsy Sweet (D) who’s running on a much stronger platform but not getting as much attention as Gideon who beats Collins rn. Betray also promotes policies that are very favorable in this survey. Can’t November be today already?? My suspicion is that the reason Biden did so well is that former GOP voters, disgusted by Trump, voted for him en masse.  Sanders is obviously too leftist for them. Time to use the 25th section 4 on his incompetent ass. If people actually vote this time it will be an epic unprecedented blue wave. You are right and I think it goes further back to Newt and Co. Thy derailed the entire party and they all went and are going along for the ride. Quit your nonsense.

The president has zero authority to regulate either.

Zero. 

And any private platform or publisher has the right to host someone or not. Period. 


Keep licking those trump boots. I bet Suzi is clutching her pearls. If Biden is "defeated", this country will burn. Me too! I’d go so far to say that she is troubled by this new information. I'm not following. Please explain If you keep saying all female this and all female that, you make being female in leadership weird. Awesome! Glad to hear. Crush her. He only does whatever is beneficial to himself. He will continue to abuse his power on Twitter unless we send a message that it's no longer politically expedient for him to do so.

Sign and share this petition to have our voices heard.


https://www.change.org/DeleteTrumpTweets I wonder if Susan Collins has grave concerns about this? But it’s ok I’m sure she will learn a lesson from this. I can’t wait!  This is going to be epic! Think of someone as malicious as Trump, who wants to be a dictator just as bad, but is actually smart. 

That's the nightmare scenario. Dude I get your point but please don't give them any ideas. It’s coming for sure.  Trump will likely wait until weeks or days before the election to unleash all the spam bots, disinformation ads, conspiracy theories and attack ads.  Will be interesting to see how easy they are to counter. Yes, no, yes. :) But what is anyone doing about his antics?  We, myself included, sit idly. What CAN we do? I know elections are coming up, but frankly that's a long way off. It's truly embarrassing to be an American. Yes, most people do not fact check most of what they read, especially when it aligns with their existing beliefs.  This is the problem with our media bubbles. Just wait til he releases the tidal wave of money he has. I fear the only reason Bloomberg failed with his carpet bombing of ads was because he didn't have a base to start with. Trump does. Almost anyone would be a better president. I'd take Kim Kardashian at this point. We should be protesting this president like Hong Kong is against extradition I had no idea this exists!! Yup, but it's been going on even longer than that.  I'd say it started in the 70s, and reached the inflection point with Reagan and went asymptotic after Obama.

At this rate, the next Republican president will make Trump look good. Market for Maine currently has it 66% for Democratic winner: https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/5811/Which-party-will-win-the-US-Senate-election-in-Maine-in-2020

Arizona is 77% for Democratic winner: https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/5809/Which-party-will-win-the-US-Senate-special-election-in-Arizona-in-2020 The lead ain't big enough -He deliberately spreads misinformation through Twitter, making the bot farms’ job way easier.

-He threatens a private company with an executive order because he violated their rules of conduct.

-He wastes a record amount of taxpayer money on golf trips and promoting/buying a drug that does not help COVID cases. Also administering the drug to veterans  through the VA to use up the stock of hydroxychloroquine that they bought with taxpayer money.

-He pushes conspiracy theories on private American citizens through his Twitter account because that citizen hurt his delicate ego.

-He completely put the responsibility of the pandemic on the states’ governors and then pushes more quid pro quo on blue states.

Other than “giving it to the libruls”, what is the appeal of this man? 'now eat shit cuz i don't have any empathy and will oppose m4a at each and every turn' She'll comfort herself with the piles of cash. It’s going to be like that until we get rid of Trump. Once he’s out of the way, I think people might start coming to their senses. same Imagine if the /r/conservative sub made a similar comment about Obama... Unfortunately... Biden was not my first choice. I'm gonna fall in line, but I sincerely hope he chooses someone more progressive for VP. VOTE! May that be the footnote in history for many many people. We've watched Trump get away with so many things he shouldn't have been able to thanks to feckless treasonous Republicans. So the answer is yes, unless we vote these unamerican bastards out and hold them accountable. No. not without congress Your title is why we need to shut down twitter. Such a solid suit, that’s why she dropped it. 🤦‍♂️ It's not spam. It's a petition directly related to the issue raised in the post. Send a message that we'll punish Trump for the vile things he posts.


https://www.change.org/DeleteTrumpTweets >There are more truly moderate conservatives in the Democratic party than there are in the Republican party right now

and the dem primaries seem to have reflected that pretty clearly this year That's sad. That's not good. Let's be honest He cannot. But the American people can send a message that we'll punish him for the bullshit he posts.


https://www.change.org/DeleteTrumpTweets It irks me daily. The bogus surveillance accusations are just the latest nothingburger. He can probably die trying. Bogus? She called a US veteran and congresswoman a Russian asset, sounds defamatory to me. Fuck HRC. So much for the "moderate" Tepublican myth. The whole party has been marching further to the right ever since GWB took office. They've lost or radicalized all voters who were remotely moderate, so in order to keep their office, elected Republicans need to pander to the right. There are more truly moderate conservatives in the Democratic party than there are in the Republican party right now... Twitter is also a company. If they want to have bias towards one party or belief that is their right. Twitter is not a right, it is a companys product Good So they've gone full Nazi. All good points, need to make voting days mandatory holiday's, and online voting and mail in ballots easier and more reliable. Nice! In 2016 VP’s were announced in July so this is just fine. I like JB’s approach in selecting a VP. I hope he finds someone who is as supportive to him as he was to Obama.  You mean the cult 45 train for the uneducated? She gambled her legacy on Trump and it will cost her everything. It’s going on to be an interesting five months. You see how moronic his supporters are. Don’t jump on their bandwagon of ridiculousness. Unsurprising. If I was I betting man I would put money on this election and az [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/twitter-ceo-stands-by-fact-check-on-trumps-tweets.html) is another! I think it is pretty crazy to think "Conservatives voices are being stiffed",  researchers have already researched this, [here](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=637508&p=4462444) is a popular reference.   There is a difference from being silenced and straight up calling someone out on there bullshit.  The obscurity is fucking bananas. Holy shit please vote in November. Trump has lied more than any other president. He has used twitter for some of that. Now, when they fact check him on something he throws a tantrum. This has nothing to do with right and wrong, it’s is just the delusional whims of a giant man baby being told no. We as a country have been using mail in ballots to some degree for years and it has not been a problem. Please, go outside, find the nearest plant, and apologize for wasting the oxygen it produces. It looks frustrating and it is.  I despise Trump and the Tea Party politics that led us to Trump.  Yes, 2018 was a leftward shift.  But there is a reason we, the U.S., purposely created a system that was not parliamentary and direct.  You elect your representatives and Senators.  The onus is on you to participate, express your political views freely, and leave it to your equal voting peers to decide what path they wanted at election time.  If 2016 and 2018 showed anything, it's that if people don't participate and don't engage, they get Trump.  When they do engage, participate, and vote, they flip the House of Representatives.  In 2020, with record breaking turnout, we can flip the Senate and take back the White House.  But it depends on people deciding democracy is worth their time.  The people determine the outcome in volume.  Sit at home or sit on your hands unhappy and we get the corporately-backed, inorganic Tea Party takeover of Congress and Donald Trump.

A signer of our Constitution looked to Benjamin Franklin after the signing and said, "Well, Ben, we've got you the democracy you wanted from the revolution you demanded.".

Franklin thought a second and said, "We simply have a democracy if we can keep it.".  That Constitution is only as strong as the people who benefit from it.  It depends on their care, participation, and engagement.  U.S. Conservatives in the 1970s depended on the left taking their eye off the ball, not caring anymore, and hopefully not participating anymore.  Why?  The right falls in line and makes money, the left falls in line and divides itself.  Voter turnout from 1980 to 2016 drive downward except for the years when they didn't and guess what happened those years?  More people on the left got elected because they were pissed and unified.

If you want revolutionary change, participate.  If your candidate doesn't win the primary, don't leave the door open for the right to depend on your non-participation.  Tough it out, then demand the change you want.  But in our system and in current times, not voting or voting third party only open the door for the evil plurality on the right and Donald Trump.  They depend on the left turning against itself.

The things I would change in the Constitution?  Get rid of the Electoral College, put the second half of the Second Amendment in BOLD, and clarify emphatically the intent of the Tenth Amendment to states that they are the children and the federal government serve as the parents.  Otherwise, it is an incredible document, not perfect, and it should be interpreted in our time, not 1787.

We can make this whole thing bloodless if everyone of us got off our asses and motivate others to do the same and participate fully.  It's a simple concept that requires sacrifice that is uncomfortable.  But it is what makes sure we can keep the democracy we were given in the Constitution.

Rant over.  My apologies. Yes. But Twitter wasn’t editorializing. They were fact checking. One of the four or five most influential heads of state incumbent in the world tweeted a lie about his own government with the intent of misleading his own people, all on the taxpayer dime. Twitter was protecting their platform by calling him out. 

Trump doesn’t know the difference between a platform and a publisher, and he also woefully fails to understand the First Amendment. I definitely will. You can count on me. I hope he just keeps eating. I guess the voters have learned their lesson from her impeachment performance. Republicans get elected saying government doesn't work, once in office cut as much funding as possible to agencies who's work they oppose, then appoint those opposed to government to heads of said agencies, point out agencies failing at there jobs, then say "See we told you" Simple, but devastatingly effective way to sugically dismantle the parts of government that prevent them from the goal of a true oligarchy. That wouldn't surprise me, he wants to fuck Ivanka.  It's more of a continuous flow of shit, just wondering when it'll end.  

Yeah, you're right, if he said he's gonna gang bang her for charity, I'd say he's par for the course.

He obviously thinks he's a superior mate, Melania is so scared of his mushroom she sleeps in another bed in another room 😂🙏✌️ Do you know the difference between publishers and platforms? And the protections that platforms are given under the law? That's the big issue at debate here. Sorry but twitter rightfully so is going to be fucked. This is the first time I will be voting by mail. As the voting site is only 5 miles from my place it has been no big deal to drive over real quickly but living in the country which is predominantly republican I don’t want to deal with the cray-cray this year, since most of them will not be wearing masks. 

Yeah for mail in voting!!! Same here, but it is nice to see how ineffective Trumps campaign and media influence is becoming. You suppress me? No...I suppress YOU TWITTER You tried to deflect from trump’s corruption.

He is literally trying to intimidate and control our media.


Address the point, don’t try to weasel a way to defend this nonsense. Trump needs to go.  Say it. You can't fix stupid. Well I guess if you just declare you're right any point can be made. Nice I was astounded by this. For me, it was the moment I realized that nobody was going to do anything about this Dangerous Buffoon. It is when the fear became real. The people crying about a Democrat becoming a dictator are the same one that‘a blind when it’s right in front of them No, it’s bullshit and rarely ever happens.

You’re a coward conservative trying to find little ways to carry trump’s water. A Paul Ryan.

You aren’t fooling anyone. You are wrong and want to sound smart but you are making yourself look silly.

Right now everyone is still distracted.

August is the perfect time. He went from "it's 15 people" to "100,000 dead is really good because it could have been 2 million".

And not a single one of his base batted an eye. Umm trump knows if he shut down twitter than he can’t use it either. How else is he going to rant crazy shit at midnight Trump has outsourced all presidential empathy, compassion and humanity to Biden.  

It frees him up to tweet more half baked conspiracies and rage against the world. I will admit that Joe has a heart. Tho, in the back of my head I realize too, that he is running for President of the US. Please learn something about politics before you comment on them. I wonder if any of those British gambling sites have odds on Trump dying in office.  Might be worth a buck or two. Sorry but at this point it's gonna take Trump participating in a gang bang on Ivanka to surprise me. I literally got someone else's mail yesterday. Ask around. It happens. And what happens if that happens to a trump supporter? He could be getting fraudulent votes.

I am assuming you mean the audience doesn't fact check for themselves? You know that they don't. The Hill is?  Do you have a link?

I sometimes read them when articles pop up in my news aggregator app thingy.  I never thought of them as particularly biased. Which will be immediately challenged in court.  The beauty is that these platforms are so big that nearly anyone can bring a suit. He won't catch covid because he's taking cloroxcolonic every day.

I get annoyed with Trump, but my real hatred came out for McConnell and Barr.  Those two are actively evil and trying to undermine the US.  The problem is that they're smart and actually pulling it off. No, but I saw the Democrats down play the virus until we had to lock down and then got mad at trump for not acting fast enough. Nothing

But you keep trying Doing it early has zero benefit Do we really want social platforms 'fact checking' for us? It seems to me that this will lead to even more confusion as the fact checkers fact check the fact checkers. I suggest that the audience do their own foot work. People LIKE Joe but his enthusiasm numbers are lower than John Kerry’s. That’s why he needs someone early that can boost enthusiasm in case he keeps up with his gaffes. 

Some of us are realistic and look at the world outside of the positive. Absolutely. It just sucks when parents let you down Honestly? I've been waiting for asylum seekers from the US to start showing up for a while... about the last three years. You won't be the first, and obviously you won't be the last. 

And YES, you CAN come here. Rent free Yes she is! I do t think I’ve ever heard her talk. I just know she thic tho But she has that squealing voice tha'ts so annoying.  That’s probably cuz she’s so banging >Can't someone just give him his binkie and blankie and put him down for a nap?

He needs a Snickers bar, lol Meanwhile Trump commemorated the grim milestone by bitching that Twitter fact checked 0.0001% of his lies. Can we come to your country and live? I never thought it would come to this but now i just want out. That would just rile up his supporters even more 
>wish he had spent the first half consoling, and the second half attacking Trump on testing, tracing, bad treatment recommendations, and economic relief

Too soon. If he goes now he lets Trump off the hook. Trump will spin so the covo will be about Biden politicising  # of dead. He needs to wait a bit. Yeah you don't wanna take tax money from those states. They won't like that. I think trump needs his diaper changed and  glue a pacifier in his big mouth. "Everyone has to be nice to me and say I'm great and Obama is stupid." The worst 49% of our voters. I don't want him to die solely because I want him to live to see his image and legacy and "fortune" totally destroyed. Dismantle everything that means something to Trump in front of his eyes. That would be worse than death. And that's what he deserves.


Also he gets to watch from jail as his financial records are made publ6, Melania tells all, his wretched kids are dragged before Congress and grilled for corruption before also going to jail, Baron changes his last name to Obama-Clinton, all his former republican allies denounce him because they're worried about their own seats, etc etc etc. Executive orders retroactively cancelling the election and making him King forever.


Mitt Romney agrees this is too far. Literally no other republican sees an issue with it. What's the order? I worry that's not enough to cover up for what will be brazen republican ratfuckery. I’ll never understand.. EVER. Here's a draft of the EO:


https://twitter.com/angrierwhstaff/status/1265878676425650178?s=12 Twitter is free, he’s been using it to his advantage for years gaining influence and spreading his false propaganda all for no cost to him. Just spreading lies and bullying people, sometimes possibly ruining lives and twisting the minds of easily led morons freely with no consequences. 

So, what’s he going to do? Sue a free service? Talk about how they “ripped him off”? Suggest that a free service allow him to continue lying for political gain or else “my lawyers will sue you for getting “too moral””?

If you don’t like it, leave it!! That’s been your party’s anthem for years! Practice what you preach, dickhead! Like ouroboros, a snake infinity swallowing it's own tail, he lies to cover his lies about lying. Do your ovaries make you better at leading? If they do, then awesome. Lead away. But, if they don't why should I care? Just means the ineffective, old, and uncaring politicians leading one of our states will be sans-penis. Care to speak to their actual leadership abilities, political beliefs, or the plans they have for the state? No? Just gonna let us all know that there'll be an entire U.S. House delegation for Biden or Trump to make uncomfortable? Nice. Have you seen the anti-intellectual Republicans display their ignorance of viral epidemiology and pandemic preparedness? I get fussy when I don’t nap too. Trump has a history of turning on those that help him. It’s only a matter of time until the old dog bites all the hands that have been feeding him, then he’ll act like he was the one that was bitten. Can't someone just give him his binkie and blankie and put him down for a nap? Fuck off, Gabbard Biden coming to the rescue doing what Trump is unable to do. Be presidential. This is kind of rude how we label him like this. I understand the criticism is deserved but no matter who the person is this is still rude. I was curious and all it said was his claims weren’t proven by CNN. I did some research and found several examples of voter fraud with mail in ballots. In fact, i get the wrong mail in my mailbox fairly often. What’s would happen if someone’s ballot ended up in my mailbox? When it gets to 50 points we can relax for a minute. Where were you when Trump has taken more substantive action in fighting Twitter than corona Preach bro...exactly how I feel. Are you aware of the differences of being a publisher vs a platform? Lewandowski is a puke but thinks he’s all that. I saw a false report on Facebook today about Biden. The link clicked to a weird site with total disinformation. And people are sharing it like it’s 100% fact. Fucking VOTE im not even old enough to vote He’s going to fight tooth and nail for a power grab. I truly hope the military will side with the country and not with him. lmao i fucking hate trump so much I feel this. So much. And I’ve never wished death on anyone so I also hate what he’s reduced me to. Dems need to get out and vote vote vote!! Haha of the nation. There are millions who don't really give a fuck and/or think it's overblown Do you ever hang out in [/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump](np.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump) 

[Great post at the moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/comments/grgxu5/twitter_is_completely_stifling_free_speech_and_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) You're right.  They first said she was named, and then said she wasn't.  They directly contradict their own reporting in this article and also contradict their write-up on it in October of last year.  Piss poor reporting. We rank 8th per deaths per 100k Now *that* would be against the First Amendment, as...you know, it would be a government offficial doing it.  I love how he probably doesn't notice the cognitive dissonance. Saddening Sweet!  I also vote by mail, but I figure vote by mail folks vote more reliably than vote in person types. Which is why I’m glad to see vote by mail being championed by Democrats and Progressives!  🇺🇸 Executive order to stop first  Amendment ? Did I miss something? People have basically been doing that from the start. His fans don't care. ? Trump is literally the president of hell. He practices Necropolitics. I saw it with my mother. I am seeing all the same signs in Trump. 

1) delusions. My mother thought JFK was close friends with my grandfather. Not too far fetched since she and her family lived on cape cod for generations dating back to the first settlers. I called my grandfather who is 95 but still sharp. “No. Not at all. Is she ok?”

You’re seeing this type of delusion in Trump already. Yet people are too afraid to give him the truth. 

2) the next step my mother had was she would go over to her neighbors and accuse them of murdering her brother. This went on for about a year. She started believing lies in her head about people, developed paranoid schizophrenia. 

You’re seeing this with trump. I don’t have to say examples, you already know. 

3) psychotic episode. My mother took off all the door handles in her home. One night she went over to the neighbors and started shoveling in their front yard next to the mailbox.  According to the report my mother was screaming her brother’s name repeatedly. Also she was saying “dad (my grandpa) told me you were here!”

This is what’s gonna happen. Trump will have a psychotic break within the next couple years Honestly, as an outsider, I feel like nothing will happen in the US without violence at this point. Your system is so woefully broken that there is no way for anyone with principles to get into any meaningful position in the US. The last two elections were people presenting a progressive face to Democrat voters and flipping on Bernie the instant they thought there was a chance of donor money drying up. And those are meant to be the "good" guys.
