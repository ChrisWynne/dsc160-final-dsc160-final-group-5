[comment]I don't think that burning is far from their fault.

Yet I think that the looters rioting is their fault.  This is their fault for looting and arson.  And while the riots also hurt the Obama administration[comment]Just because someone is involved in rioting doesn't mean they are the cause of it.  This is a criminal act[comment]I think the police need to be held accountable for violence and rioting
[comment]You mean:

Thank you for the chinese news!
[comment]It is not the police brutality that is the problem.  It is the police response to the violence that has been the problem.
[comment]I think police brutality is the problem
[comment]I disagree.  I think police brutality is that it is illegal to take or use force against a person because of race or color.  I think police brutality is that it is illegal to do things that are poorly planned or not justified.  I don't think that is the same thing. If I had a dollar for every time that I was arrested for a crime I would buy a gun.
[comment]I think the people that rioted in the streets are the real victims
[comment]They should be held accountable for the same thing that they are in the media.
[comment]I think the police have an obligation to report incidents of violent incidents to law enforcement.  It is wrong to keep people in the dark about incidents and not report them.  When you hear about a riot[comment]I think the police should have the right to respond to violent incidents and riot.
[comment]I think the oppression of minorities in the media is the problem.
[comment]I think the looting and arson is the problem.
[comment]It's not the police brutality that is the problem.
[comment]Of course[comment]I think the police should be held accountable for the same thing that they are in the media.
[comment]I think the looting and arson is the problem.
[comment]I'm not saying the looting and arson are the problem. It's the looting that is the problem.
[comment]I don't think looting and arson are the problem. The looting and arson seems to be the bigger problem.
[comment]This is not a "police brutality" article.  These people are simply not mentally healthy.  It is almost as though the system is focused on the mental health of those in control.
[comment]They don't have to deal with the real problems. They can deal with the symptoms.
[comment]They're in the media and if you're not awake at the moment
[comment]I'm not saying the looting and arson are the problem. It's the looting and arson that is the problem.
[comment]The looting and arson are the bigger problem.
[comment]I think the looting and arson is the problem.
[comment]I am a member of the "we are all people" movement[comment]I don't think this is a "police brutality" article.  It's a "we are all people" movement to protest the fact that blacks and other minorities are not given equal protection of the law.

[comment]So when you said the rioters are involving themselves in looting and arson[comment]You can't call me a racist if I don't support rioting. I am a liberal and I don't support looting and arson. I'm a democrat and I don't support looting and arson.
[comment]All the leftists disagree.  They disagree about the problems and problems with the police violence.  They disagree about the need to reform the police force.  They disagree about the need to do more to improve life in the city.  They disagree about the need to reform the police force and the need to deal with the problems of the city.

[comment]This is a dumb idea. It can be a democratic thing that can be done by every party. But if you think that is a proper posture you take a step back and think for yourself.
[comment]That's not a correct stance. It doesn't imply that violent protests are bad. The violent protests can be a source of purpose and motivation. If police are being unjustly blamed for the murder of an unarmed woman they are doing it because they don't have a purpose or motivation.
[comment]I'm sure people will argue that the "pro-police" side can simply be blamed for the crime. I think that's not what the protestors are protesting. The protestors are protesting for the police.

[comment]This is great! Why should we be surprised?
[comment]I always get this question from people who think they are completely ignorant or bad. I can't explain it to them.
[comment]Now that china has a republic[comment]I think one of the most important things to understand about the right to keep and bear arms is that the right to keep and bear arms are not "rights" they are used for personal actions.  They are an idea which is not given to us as individuals.  Our rights are taken into account which is why we must not judge people based on the "right" to have or not have an individual right to own an firearm.
[comment]I like this because it shows that the vast majority of Americans are perfectly willing to accept the right to bear arms in any form.  It is not a question of how we choose to use the right or how much. The fact that a majority of Americans accept the right to have and carry firearms is a fact of life.

[comment]Yet another racist who thinks we should be teaching all of these kids about the value of education and the importance of family.
[comment]Now you can say white liberal cops are not doing enough.
[comment]You're a disgusting moron.
[comment]I don’t think the police should have the power to arrest people for nonviolent crimes when they are simply protesting.
[comment]I should have said the same thing to the DNC and the Republican party.
[comment]I think we should not expect a police officer to do everything he can to make everyone a better person. It's a job that can be easily done.
[comment]I don’t think that these cops are even guilty of the crimes they are protesting. They’re simply protesting things they don’t want to happen.
[comment]I know I am. I don’t think the police should be allowed to do all of the things they do. They’re just protesting things they don’t want to happen.
[comment]I don’t even know it’s illegal to riot against someone without the proper documentation. 

I’m sure they are doing the stuff they are protesting
[comment]I don’t think any of the riots that we have been witnessing in Baltimore and New York are illegal.
[comment]I like the police brutality but there's really no difference between rioting and opening fire on people and then the police beating up and killing people.
[comment]I don’t think the police should be permitted to use deadly force against anyone.
[comment]I don't think the riots are illegal or that there should be restrictions on rioting and killing people. Nobody wants to hear that[comment]I don't think people can be convicted of rioting and not being arrested.
[comment]I didn't get the memo[comment]I can't imagine how people in your country would feel.
[comment]I don’t know how people in your country would feel.
[comment]I'm sure there will be a lot of comments on this.
[comment]I don't think y’all want to hear that.
[comment]I think it’s insane that they are protesting something that is in their personal interest and should be allowed.
[comment]I don’t think they are protesting anything.
[comment]I don't think you can argue that the government should be a source of moral authority for the citizens. 

Of course[comment]I don't think that the rioters are protesting anything.
[comment]I don't think they are upset that people don’t want to go to bat for them. They are protesting something they would rather not do.
[comment]I don't think police brutality is illegal at all.

The rioters aren’t protesting anything. The people protesting are protesting Nazis
[comment]I don't think I’m as opposed to the protesting people to be happy about this. I think it's okay to be happy about it...I don't think there is a difference between protesting and protesting. It is an activity that people do for a few reasons. There are people in this world who are happy to be upset about it. Getting outraged seems to be a way of life for some people.

The people that are protesting are protesting something they do not want to do.
[comment]I don't think the NYPD should be allowed to use deadly force against people that are protesting. They shouldn't be allowed to use force except at the discretion of the mayor.
[comment]I don't know what you are saying[comment]I don't think the police should be allowed to use deadly force against people. I don't think they should be allowed to shoot people. They should be required to carry a lethal weapon. The cops do not deserve any kind of respect or legal rights.
[comment]I don't know if I’m as concerned about the deaths of those protestors as you are.
[comment]I don't think I'm a racist[comment]I don't think you argue that crime is a function of crime. You argue that the police should be allowed to fire on people if they are protesting

[comment]No one knows what the riots will be like. I have no idea what the police will do. The only thing I can imagine is that they will look to the rioters for help.
[comment]The riots don't have to be violent.

The rioters are a bunch of lunatics who don't understand social justice.  They are a bunch of lunatics who think that the only way to end all oppression and violence will be to force all Americans to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" or order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state of "equality" OR order all people to live in a state

[comment]This is going to be the best speech to be given by a president in a generation.

[comment]If the gang seemed to rush into a peaceful protest anything would go wrong.
[comment]When Trump took office in January[comment]"Demonstrations happen. And we have a riot police that are taking your houses and stuff".

He was correct when he said we have a riot police that are taking your houses and stuff.
[comment]It is a shame that the president is pushing people to riot when this is the best thing to do.
[comment]I dont care what the other party thinks. He has a responsibility to deal with the problem.

I don't want to be a racist
[comment]I dont care what the other party thinks. He has a responsibility to deal with the problem.
[comment]I’m glad Trump is no longer president.
[comment]You know the California rioting gang is in trouble.
[comment]I’m glad Trump is no longer president.
[comment]I'm glad he isn't.
[comment]One of the reasons the police are so ineffective is because they are so bad.  They just can not do the job they are supposed to do.  They’re just better off in the shadows.
[comment]I'm glad he isn't.
[comment]Now you want to change the tax code? That would be a very good idea.

[comment]I think the president was right to call the rioters "violent criminals".  I don’t think he would have known that they would be violent criminals.
[comment]I'm glad he isn't.
[comment]I'm glad he isn't.
[comment]I don’t think the average liberal would have any sympathy for the people being arrested and assaulted.

[comment]This is ridiculous. Not only is he a communist and a traitor. He’s a criminal who will have to be punished in hell. He’s a criminal that needs to be punished in hell.
[comment]There’s a difference between the two.

The rioters are violent criminals that need to be punished in hell.

[comment]Ok[comment]I'm a journalist. I can't stay alone. “I’m professional as well as “cool”.”
[comment]I think this is one of my more controversial posts.
[comment]Why do American citizens seem to think that police abuse unjustly is a problem?
[comment]And this is where the blame is...
[comment]Is this a dumb question.
[comment]I actually feel that it is an understatement to say that the protests have been violent in America all year. Are we allowed to beat and kill peaceful protestors when there is no legitimate mob response to such an event?
[comment]What I'm trying to say is that there is a real problem these days.  It’s not just because of the cops killing innocent people.  It’s because they are being put in positions of power and “police brutality” is a real problem that cannot simply be left behind.  

I'm tired of people saying that they see police brutality only as a problem when it is the worst it can be.
[comment]
As a journalist
There are tons of people in my neighborhood who are doing everything they can to avoid being killed and that is a problem.
[comment]When I did a story on the disproportionate amount of black and brown deaths in the police force[comment]I don’t think the problem is that there are so many cops and so few people in the system.
[comment]What do you mean by that?
[comment]I mean[comment]It’s not that I don’t think violent protests are the problem
[comment]I'm not saying the protest is being violent. The protest is being peaceful.
[comment]I don't think it’s that I don't think it’s that the protests are being peaceful.
[comment]I worry that the public would not take that seriously. 

The protests aren’t being peaceful and they aren’t being illegal.
[comment]I think there is a real problem with police violence and that it isn’t just riots. It’s the actions by the police that are causing the problem. 

It’s the idea that you can't do anything about it and you can't do anything about it.  It’s almost like you can’t do anything about it in a country that is really pretty strong.
[comment]I'm not saying that people are being killed because of police brutality
I am saying that this is a problem that we have to deal with and that we need to fix it.
[comment]I take it that people in cities are learning from the past. 

People don’t want to hear that talk anymore.
[comment]I think the problem is not that people aren’t being killed. It's that there are so many people that are being killed because of police brutality. 

As a journalist
There are so many people in my neighborhood that are doing everything they can to avoid being killed.
[comment]I don't think the protesters are being violent. I think they are protesting peacefully and peacefully.
[comment]I am a journalist. I can't stay alone. I don't want to be the enemy of my people. I will not be a journalist this way.
[comment]I agree with you.

I'm a journalist. I can't stay alone. I don't want to be the enemy of my people. I will not be a journalist this way.
[comment]I just come from the United States. I can't stay in the States and pretend that I don't have a right to be there.
[comment]I'm a journalist and I'm not a criminal. I'm a professional. I don't have any criminal records. I'm in my mid-50s and I can speak English and I can't be a police officer.
[comment]The fact that I can't stay in the US is a blessing in disguise.
[comment]I live in California and I am not a citizen. I have been a citizen for 15 years. I don't have any criminal records. I am a professional. I'm a professional. I don't have

[comment]I'm not saying violence is not a problem. I'm saying that no one should be allowed to riot.
[comment]I was on the sub and saw a video of a dude who was beaten up by a police officer. I let my two cents.
[comment]I get that a lot of people relate to this sub because of the violent nature of it and the political rhetoric. But ultimately it's not that they are not protesting. They are protesting. The situation is so bad that it’s not even funny.

I feel like a lot of people have a lot of anger and frustration at the fact that there is no political discourse around the issue.  But honestly I don't think that they have much of a fear to try and change things. They are mostly just exploring their own lives and trying to learn from it.
[comment]Ok[comment]What can you say about that[comment]The left is full of people who don’t know what they’re talking about.  They ignore reality to make their own opinions.

Fuck the Left. Fuck the right. Fuck the left.

[comment]No one wants to hear that. I think they are being overly critical of the left. They are being overly critical of themselves.  They don't want to hear any of that. They want all the credit.

[comment]It’s not a new concept to call a video "offensive" or "offensive" or something like that. Why is that still a thing?

[comment]The problem is that the cops are the legitimate authorities. And the protests are not peaceful.
[comment]The outcome was that there were riots. The real drama was not violent protests but protests by the police that you may not have seen in the past.

The reality is that the police are the real problems. The fact that the protests are not peaceful as you might think.
[comment]I have a few questions.

What does the word "violent" mean in the context of a riot?
[comment]I don't think I've seen any of the rioters I've spoken to say that they do not want to live in fear of the police.
[comment]Just because the police are bad doesn't mean the protesters don't want to live in fear of the police.
[comment]The police are the only people you can blame on violence.

They're the only people you can blame on not having guns.
[comment]Black people are the only people who are going to get killed by the police. 

Their bodies aren't going to be found until they die.  They will be killed by the cops. 

If we're going to be honest the people who are going to die are likely to be black or Hispanic
The police are definitely the problem.

The black people that are going to die are probably going to die by the police.

The police should be corrected. Everyone should enjoy the privileges of being a police officer.
[comment]It wouldn't be a riot if we had the police.
[comment]I don't think we need a police state because everyone has the right to do the same[comment]I think that the media reports the riots in a different way.  They don't report what the police say. They report what the protests say and what the police say. 

Then the media can report what the protests say because the media can report what the protesters say.
[comment]No[comment]Finally[comment]I'm not sure how you guys understand this. The media is the problem.  The police are the problem.  The riots are the problem.  The people are the problem.
[comment]I don't know what to make of this.
[comment]I like the fact that I don't feel like I have to argue.
[comment]I can’t fathom how this would be corrected.
[comment]I'm not a fan of the police brutality[comment]Good news[comment]I wonder what exactly it would take to stop people being killed by police officers.
[comment]I wanted to ask you if you thought you probably wouldn't get killed by police officers on the streets. I think it would be more likely that you would get a head injury or some other kind of physical injury.
[comment]The police are the problem. The riots are the problem. Just because the police are bad doesn't mean they don't work for the people they are supposed to protect.
[comment]So how does that compare to the riots in the sixties or the police departments in the US?  I don't know how to answer that.
[comment]This is a completely false argument. I think we all know that the riots and the police deaths are bad[comment]I haven't seen the police responses to the riots. Again
[comment]Things are very different in the US today.  There is some success in the riots[comment]The riots are bad. The police response to the unrest is awful.
[comment]I think some people would say that the riots are bad and that the police are the problem.  I think they are bad because they are bad. 

The police are the problem because of the riots.
[comment]I think that you're wrong about the rioters rioting. What I'm suggesting is that the riots are bad because the police response to the riots is bad.  The riots are bad because the police response to the riots is bad.
[comment]We can't blame the riots for not being good. The riots were bad because the police response to the riots was bad.
[comment]I don't think the riots are bad because they are bad.
[comment]I think there are other things more important
[comment]Yeah[comment]

[comment]I have a friend who was arrested in Seattle and is a student at Cal State Houston and has been protesting for a few years. I don't know how he is able to get his things back.
[comment]It's a fairly new political movement and the people in the movement are good people who have a responsibility to follow the rules.
[comment]Bored?
[comment]Yeah[comment]I'm a student at Cal State Houston.
[comment]Police brutality should be barred in the US and all police officers should be held accountable for abuse that they commit.
[comment]If you live in the US you can still protest without being prosecuted for it. You can still protest peacefully for the sake of the protestors. It's the same in the UK too.

It's a different culture to the UK. I'm a liberal and I dislike violence. I am a peaceful person and I do not condone violence. I support the right to free speech and to protest

[comment]Anarchism is evil.
[comment]Committing crimes against the police is not a crime. The government can say you're being held to account for something that you are not.
[comment]I was on the left in the last election. I had a friend who is a member of the left and I saw a video of a man being dragged from a balcony. The man was a black man in his mid-40s and he was accused of being a white supremacist.

[comment]If any of you are reading this and you are confused by the response or feel uncomfortable by what has just happened, please try it yourself.
[comment]I believe that the LAPD is still effectively responsible for the attacks on innocent people in the United States. I don't think that the police are at fault[comment]Don’t be confused by the news that looting and arson is still being conducted.
[comment]I think that the DA’s announcement was a signal that they were going to do something to try to get the crime rates down. The riots are still going on and it is still happening.
[comment]I think a lot of people are confused by the insanity that appears in the media and the apparent lack of accountability for the police. The meme that we should all be outraged over the brutality of the police is almost comical. I think that the media is doing their best to portray the crisis as the fault of the police.
[comment]At least the media is covering the situation in a good light. The good news is it has been going on for a while.
[comment]I am not suggesting that the rioters are bad people. I am suggesting that the police should be blamed for the violence and not be blamed for the looting.
[comment]I’m glad that the police have been able to solve this issue. It’s what our cities do. It’s what the cops do. I want to hear what the Baltimore Police Department says.
[comment]I am a republican and I support the LAPD. I support the police officer shooting a black man for looting and for rioting. I believe that the riots are legitimate. You know the right thing to do is stop looting and end the looting. I don’t support police brutality.
[comment]I'm not saying that the looting is wrong. It’s not the looting that they are doing. But if the looting is wrong I’m sure that people would be upset that the police are taking sides with the looters.
[comment]I think that most of the looting in the United States is predominantly Black. The looting is up in the cities. The looting is down in places like New York and California.
[comment]I don't agree with the looting. I think that the looting and arson are happening in some other cities and not in the United States. I don't think that the police are at fault for the riots.
[comment]I don’t think the looting is either.
[comment]I am not saying that the looting is wrong. It is that the looting and arson are happening in some other cities and not in the United States. I don't think that the police are at fault for the riots.
[comment]I think both the looting and arson are unacceptable. The riots have escalated. 

The looting and arson are certainly not at fault.
[comment]I agree with the looting and arson. It is a riot and there are no arrests. Why isn’t the police doing their job as they should?
[comment]Anchor belt.
[comment]I think a lot of people are confused about the riots. I don't know when the riots began or what happened to the protestors. I really don't know how to explain it.
[comment]I am not suggesting that the rioters are bad people. I am wondering why the police are doing things that are wrong. I am also not suggesting that the looting is wrong. I am not suggesting that the looting and arson are happening in some other cities and not in the United States. I don't think that the police are at fault for the riots.
[comment]I think that the looting and arson are both unacceptable.

[comment]Democrats are racist. For a lot of their talking points they are phrasing the words like "racism" but they are also saying that somehow people in the south are more racist than the rest of the country. 

The reason they are so racist and violent is because they think that blacks arent as violent as whites. 

I don't want to misrepresent the racist thinking. 

The reason the police were accused of shooting a black man was because he was black. 

The reason people don’t think that black people are violent is because they arent as violent as whites. 

The reason people are so violent is because men arent as violent as women. 

The reason people are so violent is because they arent as violent as other races.

The reason that youre not getting rid of the police

You know almost as well as anyone else that the police don’t arrest people because they don’t intend to hurt anybody. This is because they are lazy and they don’t care about the safety of the community. 

The police are the only thing that should be there for people and that is the reason they are there. 

It’s not the place to start. 

Talk about being lazy

I’m not saying the police are bad. They are good people who take care of themselves and don’t care about anybody else. 


But the fact that the police are there to arrest people for simply setting a man on fire and people set fire to their homes and people set fire to houses and people not just set fires and set fires and arson and arson and arson and arson and arson and arson and arson and arson and arson
There is nothing wrong with them being there to arrest people and arrest people for setting people on fire

[comment]I think that all right-thinking people understand that when someone is violent they are not "offending anyone." Therefore[comment]I think that there is no difference in the way the police respond when a nonviolent person is violent[comment]I am outraged by that.  I am a Democrat and they should be treated fairly. I am not a "violent individual."  I have a friend who is a member of the Black Panther Party and he is a leftist.  He is a peaceful person who has no physical problem with police brutality.  I am not saying that he is not peaceful[comment]I don't know about you but an organized crime syndicate started this movement[comment]That's what I think. The fact that they can't “reject “the real problem” is a good thing.
[comment]I think the police should be fired. My stance is that those officers who are on the street have a right to protest and so should anyone who isn't in their vicinity. I think everyone should be able to peacefully protest and that there should be no excuse for police brutality. I am a little worried this is going to get used as an excuse for the killings of black people.
[comment]I do not think the public should be able to protest police brutality. I am a Democrat[comment]I think the police should be fired.

Anyone who has ever been charged with a crime should be held accountable. 

I do not disagree with a lot of people being charged with crimes but it’s more than a few years now since the criminal justice system has been better than we previously thought.
[comment]I think that the police should be fired.

I mean they are not cops. But I'm not going to go down that road. They should be fired.  They should be held accountable.

[comment]Good point!
[comment]No one likes cops.

The Left uses the phrase "violent" to refer to criminals. They use it to refer to those who commit crimes. The phrase "violent" is a catchall for violent crimes. It has no place in any of the media outlets that report on the crime. Sometimes it is a catchall term for crimes that occur in the context of a criminal investigation.
[comment]I don't know why people are so overly critical of cops.
[comment]The Left can be a very formidable force when it comes to showing us that we are not being few and far between.
[comment]You don't treat them with the same respect you would treat any other group. It's disgusting how much hatred they spew.
[comment]I have to agree with you. The only group I will ever support is the actual police. It's a force that is completely out of control. I think that I support the cops because I think they are the best. I can't stand another mob of people trying to ruin our future by drunkenly assaulting people.
[comment]I know you have been vocal about this for a while now. I'm not saying this is not important[comment]Yes[comment]I think you have a right to know. The Left are not held to that standard.
[comment]And here's the thing:

The police are not the only ones to be blamed for ending the looting & arson of Black Lives Matter rallies.

The Left is

Violent - they've been doing this for decades

- they're the ones who've been the most culpable in it.

[comment]I'm going to go ahead and call this a political statement. I've been saying it for months now.
[comment]It is inaccurate and a ruse to try to silence the liberal right.
[comment]As a police officer I am up against a lot of violence.   

But that's not my problem.

Police shootings are still pretty much a normal part of our society.  But the police are killing people.
[comment]It's not new to the left.

[comment]I'm afraid you are. No one is a guarantee to be successful.
[comment]I'm not a Republican. I don't care who I support.
[comment]I disagree with you on this.
[comment]I want to know what all the police violence is and what the issues are. I have kids and I have to tell them all the cops that they're powerless to stop crime.  I am not saying there aren't problems but I don't think protesting is a problem.
[comment]I don't understand what you're going to say about.  What's the point of protesting?
[comment]It's ridiculous.  I always have seen cops be held accountable for everything.  I think it's important for all the people involved to understand that the police are doing their job and that they are not being held to a high standard. I don't see a reason to protest the way I did.
[comment]It's not my place to politicize this.
[comment]Trump has my approval
[comment]Fuck Trump. They're the ONLY people who will ever call him a criminal.
[comment]I don't see a reason to protest.
[comment]I'm sorry but I am a Democrat.
[comment]I'm a white person and I don't support this.

I'm not a Democrat[comment]I do not support it[comment]I'm sorry[comment]No one is suggesting that there is no violence. I don't think you can argue that crime should be reduced to a government funded bailout of the police.
[comment]They should be held accountable.
[comment]I don't know what you are saying.  Yes I am a liberal but my views on this matter are not mine. I am a Democrat and I don't support this.

If someone is protesting a fight they are protesting a riot and if you are protesting a riot you are protesting a riot and you are protesting a riot they are protesting a riot and you are protesting a riot and you are protesting and you are protesting and you are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and you are protesting and you are protesting and they are protesting and you are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and they are protesting and you are protesting and you are protesting and they are protesting and you are protesting and you are protesting and you are protesting and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and the police and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and they are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and they're performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you are performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing and you're performing

[comment]Listen[comment]It’s not that looting and arson are out of control; it is that people seem to be ignoring the problem and just blaming it on the other party.
[comment]I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with you[comment]Well[comment]Looting can be violent and arson is illegal.
[comment]It’s about the poor people[comment]I am not against looting[comment]If looting and arson were something that we’re talking about[comment]I wish I knew what the hell was going on with the riots. I am not a violent person and the police officers and rioters I was covering for were not violent. 

I’m not surprised that people are rioting.
[comment]I'm sure most of you are aware that we tend to think that narratives and social movements are run by the few. 

“You can’t get a narrative and a narrative without people being violently wronged
[comment]I get what you mean[comment]We are dealing with an organized crime on top of looting and arson.  This guy was looting his own house and the property of a church. He came to the church and destroyed a specific church and someone else had his things destroyed. 

You have a narrative and you have people who are violently wronged and you have people who are violently wronged.
[comment]I'm not surprised that people are rioting. I am not surprised.
[comment]Isn’t looting and arson legal?  No one is saying that.
[comment]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.  You’re a shill for the big money corporations and you are still a giant petty thief. 

This is not a partisan disagreement.  It’s a political disagreement.  You know what? I don’t care what the labels say[comment]Please don’t say that to me. I am a leftist. I disagree with the way you have treated the poor.  I am a Democrat
[comment]Does anyone in the media know that the victim blaming you have put on the media is not the media bias? 

I don't understand why people want to label me racist.  I’m from the south of France.  Don’t you think people are so stupid to think that I'm not a racist? 

I’m only human and I’ve never been a republican.  I’m not a racist.  You shouldn’t be a racist.
[comment]I am more upset that you are still a republican than that I am.  I’m not a Republican[comment]How do you think the liberals are going to work out to not call me a communist? I don’t know[comment]I didn’t think you had that much influence on the media. I just thought the media is becoming a bunch of dummies who think things they don't accept.
[comment]I am not surprised.
[comment]Does anybody in the media know that the victim blaming you have put on the media is not the media bias? 

I don't care what the labels say[comment]Can someone please tell me the difference between looting and arson and the fact that I am not a leftist? I am not a Democrat and I don’t support the Democrat party.  The whole thing is a partisan thing.
[comment]I am not surprised.
[comment]Black lives matter
[comment]You are a disgrace.  You should be fired.

And I don’t think the protesters are doing a great job of handling the violence and looting. They’re responding to a legitimate protest and they’re not doing a bad job.
[comment]I will be honest. I'm not surprised that the protests are being organized by the left. I find it strange that big companies have been quick to blame both sides for the violence and to say that the police are not doing a good job.
[comment]They do not know how to deal with violence. They have been the victims of it
[comment]I don’t think police are using excessive force against protesters and looting and arson.
[comment]There are many more people who are peaceful
[comment]I'm sure it's true that there are protests when it comes to looting and that I don’t think anyone is protesting against police brutality any more than there are protesters who are protesting against police brutality. I think the fact that the protesters are protesting police brutality is a whole different ballgame.

But I don’t think anyone is protesting police brutality any more than there are protesters who are protesting against police brutality.
[comment]This is what I call a "cover up" - a cover up.
[comment]I am not saying that the riots are bad
I am saying that they are not a problem.
[comment]I don't understand the view that the protestors are the problem. The rioters are the problem. Because they are not violent.
[comment]I’m sure that the riots are bad and that I don't understand why some people are protesting against the police. I understand that people are upset at the way the police are handling the protests and that they are trying to suppress the protests.
[comment]I just don’t understand that the police are not performing a great job.  They are a bunch of bull in a hat. They are a bunch of thugs who are being pushed around by a bunch of thugs.
[comment]I don't understand that the riots are bad because the protestors aren’t violent.
[comment]They are protesting the police brutality.
[comment]I think that rioting is illegal and something that people should be protesting about.

[comment]And they are all murderers
[comment]To be fair[comment]And they are all murderers
[comment]You say: "Police violence is problematic"
[comment]You know what that means:

[https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/breaking-news/police-violence-violent-partners-dismantle-common-law-laws/](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/breaking-news/police-violence-violent-partners-disantle-common-law-laws/)

[comment]I feel that you guys are overly critical and overly ignorant of the core issues of the situation. You have made this a priority for the past 2 decades. You know that people can get killed and I'm sure that we will be the victims of this on and off the field.
[comment]You know that the police are the only ones who are truly responsible for the situation
[comment]Cities have been vandalized by arsonists and other violent criminal acts.
[comment]We all know that police are not always the best at doing their job.  But that is not the case in this case. Let's not pretend that the problem is that the police are bad.  They are certainly better than that. 

Honestly the only reason I care about law enforcement over the population is that they are a very good police force and if you put them in charge of a riot you are going to end up with an overabundance of bad cops.

[comment]Put them in charge of a riot and they will not be good cops.
[comment]I'm not saying that cops are bad
If you are to take these people seriously[comment]You know that for a while  Bill Clinton called for the creation of a National Guard
In the 24 hours since the riots there has been a spike in calls to the National Guard. 

The ones that have been called in are being called in doing their job and doing their job is not as bad as he said.
[comment]I know that I will not be able to read this and understand it.
[comment]I won't get into the details of the riots in the comments[comment]A riot is not an act of violence
It is simply a violent act that a party refuses to accept as fact.
[comment]The problem is that when the police are not there to protect the people[comment]The riot is the act of doing what we are supposed to do.
[comment]The riot is not the act of performing a duty that the party refuses to accept as the proper standard.
[comment]I don't think you mean to say that the police were not there to protect the people
or that the rioters were not doing a duty.
[comment]I dont care who was rioting
[comment]I don't know the exact number of people who are seriously injured
You and I both know that the number of people who are seriously injured is probably much higher than the number of people who die from what you and I both know.
[comment]I dont think you meant that the rioters were not performing a duty[comment]I don't care who was rioting
You and I both know that the number of people who are seriously injured is probably much higher than the number of people who die from what you and I both know.
[comment]The people rioting are the ones who are literally doing the worse things for the environment.
[comment]I dont understand why people are so quick to say that the cops are not there to protect the people. This is like saying that the boomer generation is not there to protect the people.
[comment]They're not there to protect the people.
[comment]I hate to say it but it seems that the usual suspects in the media are ignoring the fact that the police are not there to protect the people or to aid the rioters.
[comment]It's just sad that we're so quick to label bad cops and bad riots as "bad."
[comment]If you want to call a riot a riot then you have to call it what you will.
[comment]I don't know. I don't know what was said. I don't know what was said. I don't know what was said

[comment]I don't think anyone can deny that violent crime is a problem. I've lost count of the times I've seen police do it. I'm not saying we should ban all police violence[comment]I have a fairly trusting liberal friend who has a brother who is a police officer. I asked my friend to write a letter of support for him and he just sent it saying "I'm perfectly fine with looting and stealing." 

He said: "I can't stand being a police officer and I don't want to be."

His brother would not comment on the letter.
[comment]This is not a political article.
[comment]I don't know what you mean by "I'm completely fine with looting and arson." I mean[comment]I don't think police policies should be blamed for violence.
[comment]The only thing that bothers me about police brutality is that there are riots.
[comment]I'm a citizen of the USA and I think there is a connection between law enforcement and crime.
[comment]I will not be silenced.
[comment]Barely a republican[comment]It’s unfair that this is a place that exists for people to express disagreement.
[comment]I don’t like what you are saying. I am more on peace and quiet than any other sub.
[comment]There is no connection between police brutality and crime. The definition of 'violence' I read is literally: "violence against a person, whether physical or mental."
[comment]I am a republican and I am a democrat. I understand that some groups are not violent. I don’t support violence against people.
[comment]I am a democrat and I am a democrat. I have a few friends out in the south and I will be a republican in the future. I am a republican in the same way as the Democrats are. I have had people who are politically incorrect saying I am a democrat. I don't need to be. I don't need to be in the same position as the Republicans.

[comment]The media is certainly no better at covering the news than they are at covering actual events. But I don't think the media is the best sources for news.
[comment]It's my understanding that there is a large black bloc in the streets. I'm not sure if they're saying it or not but it's a minority and they're very violent.

The problem is that most of the men and women on duty and most of the city are white. I'm not sure how many blacks are in this city at the moment.

[comment]The Left is waking up to the fact that they lack a coherent narrative.  Sadly[comment]Somebody from the liberal echo chamber is busy trying to get people to learn a lesson.
[comment]They don’t care about "violent people." They focus on "law-abiding citizens" with a view to economic success. 

They are simply trying to get in the way of the announcement of a new law.
[comment]That’s how the left treats us.
[comment]I would say that taking aim at the police is a really bad word.  If you want to get a law abiding citizen off the street[comment]People are becoming more violent and more violent.  So many more don't have the mental capacity to use peaceful means. 

That being said[comment]The media is a cesspool of hate.  They have to be impartial.
[comment]We have to deal with the reality that the police are going to be in place for a long time.  The real issue is not looting and arson[comment]Honestly i'd rather end up in jail if I had to[comment]Biden got the riot squad because he didn’t want to disrupt the democratic process.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and a police officer. I’ve been an officer for 12 years. I’m a 25 year veteran and I’ll always have a dislike for the cops. I find it odd that the media is so obsessed with the "lockdown" of the streets that they ignore the fact that the rioters or the rioters themselves are actually criminals.

I’m not even going to call this a riot.
[comment]I think it's important to understand that the media is the media of the people. It's not the media of the people. The media is the main source for the right story. 

The right news is the right news. 

The wrong news is the wrong news.

[comment]I think the money should be used for social welfare programs like Social Security.
[comment]I think they should be able to deduct the money from a person’s annual income.
[comment]This is a disgrace. These people cant even pay their taxes.
[comment]They want to destroy our social security system and our economy.
[comment]It is not a charity or an organization that is any better. It is a government entity which has a sole role in the welfare of the individual.
[comment]This is exactly the way the left wants it.
[comment]I think it is time to stop pretending the press is unbiased.

And then please don’t be offended.
[comment]What the fuck?
[comment]This is why the Left is so focused on individual rights.
[comment]I think the only reason police are allowed to shoot people is to find them guilty and then punish them for the crime. Sometimes the only recourse is to kill them.
[comment]I am not saying that all people in a situation should be prevented from doing so.  Not all people are equally stupid.  Some are stupid if they don't understand the situation.

I’m not saying that all people in a situation should be prevented from doing so.
[comment]I have absolutely no problem with police killing people for being stupid or just plain bad.  Just don’t be surprised if some people are killed for being stupid or just plain bad.
[comment]It’s not the left that is the bad guys. The right is bad. The left and the right are both bad.

[comment]The police have a right to riot and attack people. The police have a responsibility to protect the people.
[comment]Cities have riots that would be fairly peaceful from a population perspective.
[comment]I am a Democrat and I support reducing the violence. I have a friend who is a police officer. He is a former cop and he is now a civilian. I have argued with him and he is a dedicated cop. He said that police violence is bad and that looting is bad. He has also said that police brutality is a hoax. I wonder what he thinks about it.

I think that people need to understand that the police cannot be the reason we have violence. They have to do it because we have a police force. They need to do it because we need it.  And that is what we need to do.

The logical solution is to get rid of the gangs and gangs
The problem is that the gangs have done violence. They want to kill and kill and die and they have destroyed lives.  The police have nothing to do with the gangs. They have nothing to do with any of the criminal gangs. We have a police force that has nothing to do with any of the gangs.

The police have nothing to do with any of the criminal gangs
It is really sad.
[comment]I'm not saying that violence is bad.
[comment]I agree. The police have a responsibility to protect the people.
[comment]There are a million and a half years of the American revolution that the police have done terrible things.
[comment]I agree. What I am saying is that the change in the police force has been so great that the police have become the party of the people. The government has become the party of the people.  The government has become the party of the people. 

So I don't really think it's a bad thing that the police are being abused or that violence against the people is any worse than the police brutality.
[comment]I don't think riots are bad. The problem is that the people rioting and looting and killing people is terrible.
[comment]They're not
[comment]No[comment]Yeah[comment]I'm not saying that violent riots have nothing to do with the police. They are not violent.
[comment]I think the problem is that the police are being enforced in a way that makes them ineffective. The problem is that people are not being punished for looting or for not being violent. They are being punished for not being violent.

[comment]This is a partisan one. They have no idea what they're talking about.

[comment]Which is why we need to be better prepared for the riots.
[comment]We have a real crisis in America right now.
[comment]I get it.
[comment]What did I say?
[comment]Seems like a really nice title.
[comment]I'm not saying there are riots in LA or out of town. Just that there are protests from the left. Or that we are in a state of rioting and we need to figure out how to deal with it. It's not a crisis that can be solved by force of arms. It's just that riots and protests can only ever be managed by force.
[comment]Long story short: it is not a crisis. It's something we are dealing with right now. Americans are paying for it.

[comment]I'm a black Dallas cop in Texas. I know one of my brothers shot and killed a police officer and I have never seen riots that have like the violence that they are having.
[comment]Should we be concerned about police brutality in general? I'm not entirely sure if violence is a problem or not.
[comment]We need to have a comprehensive analysis of all the riots that have taken place in cities across the country. I haven't seen it in the media until I started watching the news.
[comment]You are a normal person in Dallas and you should be outraged by this.
[comment]I got a text message from a neighbor who said he was hearing about looting and arson. He got me a call from a guy who was a police officer. He said he has been coming to the area for a while. 

He's not saying that the riots are wrong in Dallas but he's saying it is. I don't know if he's aware that the number of illegal immigrants is rising so it's not a huge problem. But he's right. It's mostly a black area so it's not a problem.
[comment]I'm a democrat from Texas
[comment]But this is a private citizen police department in Texas.
[comment]I'm not saying there isn't riots or that there are riots. I'm saying that the police are in the loop and they're trying to control the situation.

The fact that the police are doing this is what makes it so difficult to get help to people in need. I'm not saying that the riots shouldn't happen but it's not what we're talking about here.

And then there's the usual rants and sarcasm about how “violent people never “be peaceful”. This is a direct response to a quote from a quote I found on this sub.
[comment]I don’t mind that people are rioting and looting and burning property but I don’t think any of us should be protesting against police brutality. I just want to point out that I am not advocating violence in the slightest.
[comment]I am a decent person and I’m not being fairly critical of the police during the protests.
[comment]I think the police are a bunch of pigs that don't care about people’s wellbeing so they will just do as they please.
[comment]You know that thugs will not be the ones to kick people out of a restaurant because they think they are being oppressed by their own government?
[comment]I think there are some people who are rioting. I think if you don’t have some of the fighting to do with individual people being oppressed then you can’t blame the police on any particular group.
[comment]And I don’t think there are any violent people in the world. The problem is that the police are pretty violent. The problem is that the police are pretty violent so they can’t be blamed for what they do. 

It’s not unreasonable for a riot to be a riot. But there will always be people who riot and that usually means people who are violent.
[comment]I think we should focus on how we deal with crimes. All the illegals and all the crime that happens with the illegal immigrants.

I think our current approach is the wrong approach to dealing with crime. The problem is that most of the illegals aren’t violent and some of them are violent and burning property far too often. 

It’s important to understand that the illegal immigrants aren’t violent[comment]I think we should focus on crimes that are at least in the physical presence of the illegal alien.
[comment]I have two kids[comment]“I want to hear from people at home and not on my phone.”

I think the worst offenders are the ones that don’t have the legal status to be a citizen.

[comment]I think we should focus on crimes that are in the physical presence of the illegal alien.
[comment]I'm a conservative and I don't think it's a coincidence that the level of violence against the illegal immigrants is far higher than the level of the illegal alien population.
[comment]I don't think Trump is a racist. He is a slave to white supremacy and is a monster to the poor.

Notice that I am not saying that a mob or arsonist are not violent. The word is used to describe peaceful protest. The problem is that it is not a bad kind of protest. The problem is that it is a bad kind of protest.
[comment]It is not illegal to riot. It is illegal to set fire to your own house.

It is illegal to riot in Washington.

The question is: Why is there an equal amount of violence and looting and arson? Why are we even talking about it?
[comment]We should be protesting. But I can't agree more with the violent and looting of cities. It's not a new concept. The media are trying to control the news and politicians are not on the front lines. The idea that people who are protesting are becoming violent is ridiculous.

I've had trouble watching the news:

[comment]Could we talk about how the media can and should not be a part of this. I come from a middle class family and the media is not a part of my life anymore.
[comment]Why is there a mention of the riots in NYC?
[comment]Why is this not in the title? It is being completely censored and is not mentioned.
[comment]This article will cause a lot of lefties and independents to fall in line.
[comment]I absolutely demand an investigation. There is a clear violation of the police and we should investigate this.

This is about people being afraid of the other side. I'm sorry you are so angry.
[comment]I'm from California and my dad is black. He has been in this country for 20 years and he is a civil rights lawyer. I think a lot of people in this country are not smart enough to understand that black people are not "blacks" not the other way around. They are treated fairly and not put under a lot of government pressure.
[comment]This is a terrible idea. No one is saying it is wrong or that it is a bad idea.
[comment]This is the worst thing I have ever heard in my life.
[comment]There is no video of this. It's a lawsuit filed by the police in the US against the media for attacking the black people. The lawsuit charges that the media has "impeded[comment]This is honestly shocking to me. I mean

[comment]I think the term "violence" is a far more accurate and accurate term.  No one seems to understand how violence is a social construct that is formed in the social contract and not a political one.  It is deeply institutionalized in the corporation and not a social one.  

The problem with that is that it's a social construct at best that is not a political one.
[comment]Why is the media so focused on the right and the left when they are actually focused on the wrong side of the chessboard?
[comment]The media has a very hard time covering the real issues
[comment]Let's not be the victim of a rhetorical flourish.
[comment]The right is a social construct that gives us the power to do things that the left does not.

So no one is saying it's wrong for cops to riot.
[comment]I hate to say it but the left is a social construct[comment]And it's just white men that are being assaulted.
[comment]You know the thing is
[comment]I'm not saying police are bad.
[comment]I would argue that the right is just as bad as the left.
[comment]The left is the social construct that gives us power.
[comment]Yes[comment]The left is the social construct that gives us power.
[comment]Justice for what?
[comment]It really does have a lot of meaning to me.
[comment]That's not what's so important about being a democrat. I don't think you can put into words the amount of power that the left has.  But I think the fact that the left has been able to control all the issues and not be controlled is great.
[comment]The left is the social construct that gives us power
[comment]On the other hand[comment]That's not what's so important about being a democrat.
[comment]That's not what's so important about being a democrat.
[comment]If you want to be a democrat then you're not democratizing the shit out of the left.
[comment]Yeah
[comment]I'm surprised the left is still so tolerant of the left.
[comment]The left is the social construct that gives us power
[comment]They're saying that they're gonna change the standards of what police are supposed to do and what they're supposed to do in order to be more tolerant of the right and more tolerant of the left.
[comment]You know I want to be a democrat but I'd rather be a supremacist or a socialist
[comment]The left is the social construct that gives us power.
[comment]I'm a republican[comment]I'm a republican and I'm a democrat.
[comment]You know I don't want to be a republican[comment]Because I'm a socialist.
[comment]I don't have the courage to support a leader who isn't a socialist.
[comment]I think it's reasonable that we're all on the right.
[comment]I don't think the left is the only social construct that has been built for good reasons.  The left has been built to do things that the right doesn't.  Perhaps the left has been built to do things that the right doesn't.
[comment]I don't believe the left is the only social construct that has been built for good reasons.
[comment]The Left is a social construct that gives us power.

[comment]When people take the left to task[comment]I don't understand the logic.

[comment]I am confused how people on this sub think about guns and police brutality.
[comment]I think I read the article here:

The disproportionate number of people killed by police during a given year is a wake-up call. The numbers that have been reported are not statistics
[comment]How many cops are killed by an officer each year? How many people are killed by police each year?
[comment]Lol.
[comment]theres nothing new about this. all the cops killing each other every year
[comment]The problem is that "unjust" cops are what are "unjust" cops.  Most of the people killed by police in the US are "unjust" cops. The same is true for "unjust" police.
[comment]Another way to look at it is that the US is a criminal state. The US government has been corrupt for the past 70 years in both the political and legal arenas.  The government has been corrupt for the past 50 years in both the political and legal arenas.  The government has been corrupt for the past 15 years in the legislative arena. 

The problems were very real and that is why crime rates have increased in the US over the past 15 years. 

For example[comment]Are you threatening to shoot people if they don't stop protesting?
[comment]The police are the real problem. 

The problem is not that the police are unjust but that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust based on the fact that they are unjust

[comment]The left never has been more stupid.
[comment]I don't see why the police are the reason people are losing lives in the first place. 

The police are the reason people get shot every day and people are dying every day. 

They are the reason the economy is weak and people are dying every day. 

They are the reason police are killing people every day. 

They are the reason people are being killed every day. 

They are the reason people are dying every day. 

That not only doesn't address the real issue but over the last few years has given way to the narrative that if police brutality doesn't happen then we just need to keep shooting.
[comment]I don't know about you[comment]I've called this sub a "Marxist sub" for a while now.  I don't support the police.  I have lots of friends and I'm a huge fan of the cops.  I share the same opinions. I can't say I agree with everything they say.
[comment]The left is literally the only group of people that can say the same thing about a crime.
[comment]I come from a liberal community in a conservative part of the country. I am a member of the Black Lives Matter movement and my friends and I are all equally outraged by the bad cops killing innocent people.  I know of a few people I have called out for their actions but I am pretty sure those are mostly white white people.
[comment]It's a minor gripe against the police. I don't think the police are bad.  I'm not saying the police are bad they are bad.  I'm saying the police are bad because they are bad and the good cops are bad because they are bad.
[comment]I don't know about you[comment]I don't know about you[comment]Because the Left is so huge that they hate the cops and hate the government. That's why they are so obsessed with the preservation of the status quo and the preservation of these black lives.

[comment]The problem isn't that riots are bad. It's that most of us believe that it's our responsibility to maintain order and that's exactly what we see happening in the media.
[comment]So it's a riot if they kill a cop?
[comment]There's the problem with the narrative that “all cops killed by protesters” is a hoax. It’s a fact that the police brutality rate in America is actually higher than the national average.
[comment]Sadly[comment]Well[comment]Oh wait[comment]I'm a liberal and I love protesting
[comment]The problem is that there are virtually no protests in places like New York or San Francisco. The riots aren’t the end of the world the riots are a distraction and excuse. The only thing driving the riots is the fear of police brutality.
[comment]Is it really a riot if you're killed by cops? I'm from California and I've seen two cops killed by a human being.

[comment]I don’t think we should have to go to war[comment]I think a lot of people are using the word "liberal" to refer to the police force.  

The fact that the police are bad is a serious distraction from the real issue of the problem. It’s a distraction that doesn’t have to do with the police.  It has to do with our freedoms. 

The fact that they are bad in and of themselves is a distraction from the real issue of the problem.

I don’t think that the police are bad as a whole.  I think that they are bad because there is a gap between the two sides of the law that I think is very small. And I think the gap has to do with the police refusing to respond to protesters.  I think we will be watching a lot more and the police response will be very different.

[comment]I said the Democrats need to wake up and stop alienating the American people.
[comment]I don't know how many people are reading this and thinking that I'm not aware of this issue. I am a black man in the south and I am a strong supporter of the police.
[comment]I would disagree. 

I'm not a Democrat. I am a Republican.  I personally support the police and I don't regret it. 

I have a black friend and he is a cop and I am not afraid to take my side.
[comment]I'm a Republican and I'm not a Democrat. I am a Republican.

I am a black man and I respect the police.

I think some people are scared of being called a racist or a sexist. I think that's a fair point.

I'm a Republican. 

I'm a Republican. 

The non-partisan group we have would be put on a blacklist and there would be a ban on all political speaking.

This is why I am so proud of the “nongovernmental organization” for which I am a member.

[comment]The most shocking thing is you don't just say anything. You swear and you call out people you disagree with. And sometimes you will even try to attack other people.
[comment]They don’t want to hear what we say and do. They hate to hear what we say and do.

[comment]I'm not saying that people should attack police officers. Why do we have to go to all the law enforcement agencies? How about you and me. We have a lot of work to do and this is a job that we are all going to do. I do hope they get over it.
[comment]I'm not saying that the police brutality problem is completely over. We all have ways to go. We need to be accountable for our actions and take responsibility for our actions.
[comment]I don't know what to make of this. Someone might want to point out that the riots and the attacks on African Americans and Latinos are entirely the result of white people being violent and white people being a racist and I would be offended. But they don't know that black people are a racist and are not the only ones.
[comment]I think that the violent protests are part of an ethnic division of the country. The riots are part of a larger problem. It’s not about one race or one culture. It is about two.

I think this also applies to both sides. The case against the police is more complicated than the police officer's argument.

I would love to see the constitutionally qualified commentaries and debates on this sub.
[selftext]

I agree that many in the media and in the general populace don't know their own rights are being violated. They are not able to understand their own actions or understand their own emotions. This is not a situation that needs to be discussed on CNN or Fox News.
[selftext]
This is the problem with the media. The media is a public institution and the media are their masters. They don't understand the human action and the actions of others. The media has the power to control all sorts of emotions and emotions.

This is not a problem that we have to solve quickly. This is a matter of politicians and the media controlling the emotions and actions of the people.

[comment]I think there is a difference between a police mentality and a republican mentality.
[comment]The problem with this argument is that there really is no difference between people who want to maintain order and people who want to loot and riot.  You don't need to look at the riots and looters and police violence to know that people really aren't happy or peaceful.  It's a really big difference in terms of where you and I are and what we are doing.
[comment]If you want to be an equal citizen or to be a free republic[comment]I know that some of you might not care about the crime rates in America and would rather see the government take care of things like healthcare. I know that many other people are not happy about the state of the economy and the state of state we have.  I know that they hate the police and they want to see more guns on the streets. I know that they have no interest in keeping the government running and they want a government that is run by the people.
[comment]I always worry that a leftist would just say that the police are the authorities and that they are not dangerous. The police are not real and the government is not accountable.
[comment]Democrats I am old enough to remember told me to get out the vote in the mid 90's when the Democrats used to be in the minority.  I was opposed to the Democrats on the House side and voted for them in the Senate.  I remember the anger and disgust in the Democrats and the anger and disgust in the Republican Party when they used to be in power and they used to be in power.  I remember the anger and disgust and the disgrace that the Democrats have in the Democratic Party that could have been avoided if Democrats had been in power and they used to be in power.
[comment]I'd like to know what the level of violence in some cities is.
[comment]I am from the main republican state of Texas[comment]I live in the south and people hate the police. I am the only republican in the state. I get a lot of hate for my state and it is the only state I live in. I have had problems with the police for the past few years. I am a republican which means that I am pro-life and I believe in the right of religious freedom. I am a democrat and I am pro-life.
[comment]I live in another state that is on the right side of the country. I think that in the future the police will be more of a threat to republican republicans as the laws of that state are more liberal. I think that the police brutality is definitely an issue.
[comment]I can’t even get my head around what happens to anyone who has their back locked down by a racist cop. The only thing I can come up with is that they are burning people down so that people can get out of the way.
[comment]I am of the opinion that the two or three instances of looting and arson that are mentioned in the article are not the result of looting and arson and are not the result of any public-health issues.
[comment]I think the three incidents that are mentioned in the article are simply the result of looting and arson and the other two are not the result of any public-health issues.
[comment]If you want to be a republican[comment]I don't think it's a coincidence that some of the people in the article are polar opposites
[comment]I wonder how many people in the article have a mental breakdown after reading this.
[comment]You can't be a republican or a Democrat if you don't believe in the republican cause and the democrat cause.

Fuck the police.
[comment]If I had a dollar for everytime I read this
[comment]I think this is a pretty good read. The section on the criminal was pretty controversial. I agree the civilian response was poor.
[comment]I'm not surprised at all that the riots don't work out.
[comment]What I'm surprised is that the protesters don't seem to care about the people they're protesting against. There's a lot of violence and there's a lot of looting and arson.
[comment]I'm not surprised at all.
[comment]I feel like the media has an unfair picture of the situation. It's easy to dismiss anything that doesn't seem to be to the point of being violent or messy. But you don't have to be a racist to see that this isn't a normal occurrence.
[comment]Police brutality has been on the rise in America for decades.

The media and politicians don't seem to care much about the people they're protesting against.
[comment]Wow[comment]Just because people don't like or are against it doesn't mean the situation is bad.  It's really annoying to read articles that don't make that clear.
[comment]This is not the place to be.
[comment]I read the article and think "well what am I supposed to do about it?  I don't care what color you are[comment]Love it! You should read it!
[comment]I love the article!
[comment]???

My parents have been saying this for about a decade.  The police are brutal.  They don't work.  They don't kill without a reason.  They make the victims feel bad and they make everyone feel bad. The victims don't feel bad or want to look bad.  The victims don't feel bad.  The police are literally killing people for no reason.  The victim doesn't want to look bad.  The police make the victim feel bad.  The victims don't want to look bad.  The police make the victim feel bad.  The police make the victim feel bad.  The victim doesn't want to look bad.  The victim doesn't want to look bad.  The victim doesn't want to feel bad.  The victim doesn't want to look bad.
[comment]Lol lol
[comment]I wonder why anyone would want to go there.
[comment]I live in Austin. The police are clear in their actions. The victims and the police were clearly not being followed and the arrest was both unjust and didn't feel justified.
[comment]She's a good journalist... but why do you
[comment]I've been there for the past 6 months. I am so upset.
[comment]I thought she was a journalist.
[comment]I'd like to get to the bottom of this. I'm from Texas. I was told that she was a journalist in the Austin Bee. I was told that the Bee's website is not a news source and that the article was not intended to be a news source. I wasn't told that the Bee does not travel around Texas.  I was told that the Bee accepts donations and doesn't accept donations from other news sources. It's funny how the Bee seems to think it is a news source. It seems to be a sub for a guy who is a Democrat.

I'm sure she's a journalist. I think she's a damn good journalist.
[comment]I don't know why anyone would want to go there. The police are clear. The protestors are on the streets.  The protestors are peaceful and peaceful.  The police have clear evidence that they are killing people.
[comment]I am so sick of these people.
[comment]I'm a conservative and I am also offended that these people support the police and have no self awareness.
