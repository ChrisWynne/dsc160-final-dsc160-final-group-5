Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]I’m not against marching in the streets for every cause and every opportunity. However[comment]I’m a little skeptical of all the rhetoric and negativity from people on the left.
[comment]Now they're just saying they want to keep the rich off the streets?
[comment]We're all busy fighting the  virus.
[comment]Like the rest of the left
[comment]Well[comment]I'm a Democrat and I wouldn't vote for a republican. I’d vote for a democrat if it’s in this case.
[comment]When are you going to stop protesting?
[comment]I voted for Bernie for president and I still don't think the protests are a good idea.
[comment]It’s just a distraction
[comment]You know[comment]I was thinking that the protests are purely political rather than something that should be celebrated.  

What a fucking waste of time.
[comment]I’m a Bernie supporter. What happened to him?
[comment]This is the same people who are protesting in a bad way but beating the shit out of the police.
[comment]Omg I'm a Bernie fan but this is a protest?
[comment]I think protesting is a good idea as long as nobody gets hurt.
[comment]I don’t see protests in action. They're just protesting the police beating of the protesters.
[comment]I don’t think protesting is a good idea.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I'm against all kinds of government action. However[comment]I’m going to vote for a democrat if it’s in this case.
[comment]They should remove the Occupy Wall Street protesters from the streets because they're protesting.
[comment]I agree[comment]I’m a Bernie fan. What happened to him?
[comment]I voted for Bernie on the Democratic ticket. And I know many of my Bernie supporters are not Bernie supporters. But[comment]I’m a Bernie supporter. What happened to him?
[comment]I don’t even care if Sanders is the nominee. I just like republicans.

If we wanted to protest the way we should protest the police they shouldn’t be protesting.
[comment]This is the same people who are protesting the rioters in the streets. They're unrepentant.
[comment]Bernie is a socialist.
[comment]I voted for Bernie in 2016. I've never had a bad time with him.

He is the last step forward for the left
It’s time to organize and do something about it!
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter. This is a protest. I’m against all kinds of government action. However
How is it that people who aren’t Bernie supporters should be protesting?
[comment]I'm a Bernie fan. This is a protest. I'm against all kinds of government action. However
The Democrats just call the protesters "an enemy of the state" and pretend they are a non-profit organization.

The protests are just protest.

As long as you aren’t protesting[comment]No[comment]I'm a Bernie fan.
[comment]No[comment]Bernie is the best candidate to combat the left
[comment]The left is gonna shut down the country
[comment]I just voted for Bernie and I find the protesters to be an enemy of the state
[comment]No
[comment]How about we hold those people accountable?
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter.

[comment]I think the reason the media and republicans have been so silent is that they don't care. They're just busy trying to make up for their failures.
[comment]I understand that most Americans are on the fence about this[comment]If Coronavirus were to occur[comment]Coronavirus is the virus that left the US and spread quickly to other parts of the world. It's been around for a while now and seems like a pretty big deal.
[comment]Didn't we all just turn away from China during WWI?
[comment]Peaceful protests are the new fascism[comment]https://www.cnn.com/2014/02/31/politics/climate-change/china-death-of-the-first-coronavirus/index.html[comment]I haven't read it and it's nowhere near as violent as we all know[comment]It's like the tide of the world turning against us.
[comment]I'm not a big fan of apathy[comment]The only thing that was more encouraging than a peaceful protest was a mass exodus from China.

It was actually a pretty good thing for China as a whole.
[comment]It's a perfect example of why we need to be doing something about the spread of communism.
[comment]We are the ones who need to be making sure that we have the resources we need to take back our people from communism. Otherwise the people with the most power are the ones to be destroyed by democracy.
[comment]I think the best way to understand the lack of interest in this is to think of it this way. The people who are most likely to be affected by this are the ones who are most likely to be in a position to actively spread the virus.

The first thing we do is protect ourselves. The second is to get a government healthcare system that is free of government interference.
[comment]Well if this sounds like a good idea to you and everyone else[comment]That is a good thing for China.
[comment]It's a good thing for people in China. It makes them feel like they have the power to do what they want.
[comment]It's not a good thing for a cell phone company to be like

"We have the responsibility to protect the public from the virus."

If that were the case we would be getting more virus every year[comment]You know what? It's not communism.
[comment]Let's all get prepared and shut down the Chinese government.
[comment]So much for the fact
We're the ones who need to be making sure we have the resources we need to be making sure that we are protected from communism.
[comment]Well if that sounds like a good idea to you and everyone else[comment]I was like
I don't really like communism.

The only thing I am against is the requirement that we have free healthcare

But we have to have healthcare!

If we don't have free healthcare we are just more of a threat to ourselves and the world.

And the democrats are the ones who are going to keep it from us.
[comment]I think the good news is that this is a good thing for China.


It's the government that is responsible for the virus[comment]I'm a communist.
[comment]This is what I'll never forget.
[comment]That's the thing. The good news is even without free healthcare[comment]I believe the bad news is that the Chinese government is busy trying to make them even less free.

I think the bad news is that there are some people that have already been

[subtitle] I was shocked at how many people were being ignored.
[subtitle] No one is being shut down on the grounds of “freedom of speech”.
[comment]I’m not sure if the left cares or not. They have been covering themselves in disinfectant for the last week[comment]I just want to know how many people are shut down because of the protests.

I’d like to think they are doing it to protest the senate being closed for the national holiday.
[comment]They don't care who it’s for how much.
[comment]When do you want to be a republican?
[comment]So we should just shut the streets?
[comment]I was thinking of voting out Warren[comment]Not that those are the issues I’m worried about.

If there is an active shooter in the area[comment]Just my opinion[comment]Fun fact: When Coronavirus hit’s the world in 2010[comment]It’s like the Chinese Communist Party was trying to blow up the US and the US was able to stay on the same side and not get sucked into the globalist narrative.
[comment]Well
As a socialist/leftist I agree with all the ive heard so far.

But the person who is the most responsible for the outbreak is the communist party.
[comment]Where is the outrage here[comment]Oh it’s my fault[comment]I will not be supporting his cause in the near future.

[comment]He said the only way to stop the spread of a pandemic is to quarantine all infected people.
[comment]He was protesting.

It's not a vaccine. It's a virus.

This is a pandemic.

It's a virus that is spreading in a very big way[comment]I think this is an important point.

I don't think the government is offering any guarantees against the spread of the virus. I'm not sure if they're all the same or just the same.
[comment]This is the same as the spread of the flu

[comment]I can't help but wonder if there is another side to the story.
[comment]Communists should have the right to protest[comment]This is why we need to get impeachment hearings.
[comment]This is why we need to actually make the case that people should be able to protest without being arrested.

Why the whole world hates the Republicans[comment]I don’t care if you're a republican or a democrat. If you think stopping the spread of this disease doesn't matter to you[comment]I need to get out of here[comment]That’s why it was a good idea to just keep the mentally ill and mentally ill from protesting.

[comment]How many people are joining in the protests in NYC?
[comment]When you think of protest[comment]I don't know how people who disagree with the left are going to be happy to shut down another city.
[comment]It’s not just protesting. It's an entire right-wing movement.

What you're saying is that there's a right-wing movement that is more than willing to literally shut down a city.

They're going to try to get it shut down because they prefer them to the left.
[comment]I'm not a big fan of protesting.
[comment]How bad is it that there are riots? What is the point of protesting if you're not even being arrested?

Like I said[comment]I don’t care if you're a republican or a democrat. If you think stopping the spread of this disease doesn't matter to you[comment]I don't know how people who don't support the left is ever going to be happy to shut down another city.

[comment]I'm a Democrat and I love the Democrats. I don't believe that the left is a cesspool of hatred and hate. The left is a cesspool of hate and hate.
[comment]So if you're a liberal and you think some of the left wing party is ruining America.

You are a disgrace to the country

Why is this happening
[comment]I'm a liberal and I just want to know how you feel about some of the things the left is doing to help you.
[comment]I don't even know what to say to that.

But the left the most hateful of the far right.
[comment]I hope they don’t try to sell anyone to them.
[comment]Then I can start making my own decisions.
[comment]I really want to believe that Bernie won the election.
[comment]A good thing for Bernie is that he won.
[comment]Why do this people have to go to war?
[comment]What's the difference between a war and a country defense?
[comment]I think the left has lost its way.

I think it's time to go back to the old way.

We should all be grateful for the freedoms we have right now.
[comment]I know I'm glad that the left is getting all its power from the media and Democrats as a whole.
[comment]I think the left has lost its way.

They're off the rails.

[title]Trump gets his words out about impeachment
[selftext]https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/01/21/trump-gives-us-
====================
[title]
Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]I’m a Republican and I am generally against any immigration reform. I'm not a fan of mass incarceration[comment]I know people are saying this but I'm a little confused by the amount of coverage and some of the arguments being made. I’m a man and I’ve supported immigration reform for years. However, one thing I don't want to do is allow people to think they have power.
[comment]This is the same common sense that I have been hearing them trump and McConnell make all the time. I have hated hearing anything that they hold any real power to the public. 

But the fact that people are willing to risk their lives to do their job and defend the constitution is what will make them vote for this bill.
[comment]You want to be the Democratic party?
[comment]Then what is the point of this whole party?
[comment]Yes. The Democrats are the party that destroyed the country. They need to be brainwashed by a cabal of people who want to destroy the rest of us.

This is why I believe Trump was going to use the crisis to get a trade deal.  They would have had a red and blue flag ready to go. But Trump refused to sign it.  He wanted to use it as leverage against China.
[comment]I voted for Trump[comment]No. The Democrats are the same.
[comment]They should be ashamed of themselves.
[comment]What a disgrace to our country.
[comment]The left is full of crap
[comment]It seems they have no empathy and a pathological hatred of any people who protest.
[comment]I hope the left is 'realising' that the media doesn’t report facts.
[comment]I think the point of this is to remove Trump from office.  It’s a losing cause (expletive removed)
[comment]All the left does is hide behind that passing self-serving narrative or try to pretend it isn't true.
[comment]The left is a bunch of desperate people who are trying to downplay the reality that this is a hoax.
[comment]I’m a woman who grew up in a conservative house and just can't stand the left. There was an event that happened in my family and that was a woman from my family that was vandalized. She was a conservative
I don't know[comment]I’m a progressive and I don’t see any reason why that's a thing.
[comment]It’s disgusting to me
[comment]I’m a republican and I agree the left should be ashamed of themselves. I’m not a republican[comment]I would always vote for the more popular candidate
[comment]I'm a local Democrat and I disagree with the left's position.
[comment]Even Trump supporters should get the same
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I'm not against immigration. I would support whatever candidate is best for the country.
[comment]I voted for trump. I’m not a fan of immigration and I’ll be voting for whoever is best for the country.
[comment]I’m a republican and I agree this is a circus effort. It didn't work[comment]It’s a circus.
[comment]I’m a democratic and I’m not against immigration. I agree this is a circus effort. It didn't work[comment]I think Trump should be removed from office
[comment]I’m a Democrat and I'm not against immigration. I agree this is a circus effort. It didn't work

[comment]Yes[comment]That and they were all right about one thing.
[comment]How many times have we seen that type of behavior from the very top?
[comment]So many nice people and ideas and people who need to be attacked for their No-Nonsense-No-Facts
[comment]I think we should all be trying to keep people off the streets and not go out and protest[comment]This is why we need "in the streets."
[comment]If people are not arrested for protesting[comment]A lot of people in the USA are protesting
You're welcome[comment]I grew up in a very conservative area. I have a brother who is a republican and I am a liberal. Both of them have the same opinion and I am able to understand their case with the same morals and they are both peaceful people who are all on the same page
[comment]The protests were peaceful. The protests were illegal.
[comment]Everyone was okay with the ticketing or the removal.
[comment]I don't think we have any right to turn in someone we don't agree with.
[comment]I think if you're free you should be able to protest.
[comment]No[comment]I don’t mind protesting.
[comment]Why are protests allowed? Why are people arrested?
[comment]I’m sure you’re all going to be protesting and protesting. 

If you protest and you’re arrested
Hands up don't go in the street
[comment]It’s not cool to be arrested.
[comment]But how do people still get on? Protest and arrest.
[comment]Do you know how many people have been arrested for protesting?
[comment]What's the more you protest[comment]I don't know about you but when I do[comment]What happened to protestors last night? 

I was in a bar and a man got arrested. I stood up in the middle of the street and people were blocking the way to the police station. I was protesting and the guy got arrested and he got a beer. 

The man went to police. The protests have gone to hell.
[comment]What about the people protesting?
[comment]I think we should all be protesting.
[comment]If you protest you’re not a bad thing
[comment]I think people should be able to protest. Protest is free speech
I agree with what the protestors are doing. Protest is not. Protest is not free speech. Protest is not a police state. We are free to protest and protest.
[comment]You know what else is free? Protest[comment]I'm a liberal. Protest is free speech.
[comment]I agree with where you're coming from. When people protest[comment]What about the people protesting?
[comment]I’m a republican.
[comment]The people protesting are disturbing.
[comment]Why are people arrested?
[comment]Do you know how many people have been arrested for protesting?
[comment]Do you know how many people have been arrested for protesting?
[comment]When the focus is on the people protesting[comment]We should all be protesting. We shouldn’t be isolated from our rights.
[comment]I have no problem with protesting and have no problem with police arresting people protesting. Protest and arrest are ok. Protest and arrest are not. I’m a democrat and a republican. I like these two sides of the same coin.
[comment]I think the people protesting should be arrested.
[comment]No[comment]I think if protesters

[comment]While I'm here[comment]It was awful.
[comment]I think the best way to understand it[comment]It was like the first time I went to a gay bar. I could hear the bar owner saying "I love it!"

I moved in a couple of months ago and have a great time there. It was a happy place for me.

I was a bit worried about the president but he is the best president I have ever lived.
[comment]this is what the left wants to hear
[comment]I don't think we can say these things without their permission.
[comment]I think that coronavirus is a hoax.
[comment]Just felt I needed to take a moment to reflect.

The number one thing people will not admit is that corona virus was a hoax.
[comment]I'd be shocked if there weren't many people who still think the virus was a hoax.

Yet[comment]We can all agree that a lot of the blame is on the coronavirus.
[comment]I will say this[comment]I don't know I don't know what the political goal is here. I don't know if Coronavirus is a hoax or if it was a bad idea. I understand the double standards in the media. I know the mainstream media is trying to politicize the issue[comment]People can point to anywhere in the world where a girl is being raped or raped by her boyfriend. Or where a man is being murdered by his wife. Or where a person is being raped by a mob. Or where a woman is being raped by a man.
[comment]How the hell can the left ignore corona virus?
[comment]I hope the Democrats get their asses kicked for this.

I hope it helps that both parties continue to have this kind of political rhetoric. 

The left are completely incapable of being honest and do their job. 

They have hijacked this movement and the real truth is that the left is a cult.
[comment]So is the right.

Just look at the primaries. 

I don't know who is going to be the nominee[comment]I mean[comment]So is this a hoax?
[comment]I don't know how they can come up with anything like that.
[comment]Except they're running in a fucking landslide.
[comment]It's a hoax.
[comment]So[comment]Coronavirus is just a virus that is being spread by a virus.
[comment]I'll be OK with that. I'll still be fine with it.
[comment]I dont know what the liberal crowd wants

I don't know how they can find this information.
[comment]I don't know how they can find this information.
[comment]I don't know how they can find this information.
[comment]I don't know if it's a hoax or a hoax[comment]I just want to say that I don't care. The left just want to destroy me.
[comment]I don't care. The left simply want to destroy me.
[comment]I don't care. The left just want to destroy me.
[comment]It's just a hoax
[comment]Is it a hoax? If so[comment]It's like the left are trying to destroy Hillary Clinton with a virus.
[comment]I don't care. The left just want to destroy me.
[comment]I don't care. The left just want to destroy me.

[comment]I agree.

Just the other day this guy came out in open arms of the police and the Democrats. I didnt get the perspective that he was being disrespectful. Fuck him.
[comment]I'm not a fan of the deportation of illegal immigrants. I think it's a good thing[comment]What is the point?
[comment]I'm not a fan of immigration either. It just makes it even worse.
[comment]I agree.

I think it's good that we get the basic freedoms we deserve.
[comment]New York state is just going to go down in history as a place to keep your ass hidden and take it all.
[comment]The real reason why this happened is that the Democrats controlled the legislature and the governor[comment]I don't care what the clamor is about.
[comment]You know[comment]I remember when the Democrats were starting to make the case for some kind of immigration reform. They said we were going to have to provide people with jobs and that we were going to be a socialist utopia.

And the Democrats took a guy named John Deere who was a high school drop out[comment]I think this is just trying to make people think again.
[comment]I think this is about the party and the country.
[comment]If the Republican party is so afraid of the left that they stopped even considering immigration reform[comment]I think the Democratic party is a bunch of shit in the assholes category.
[comment]I don't read much lefty but I've noticed that the left is openly hostile to immigration reform[comment]I think it's important to realize that the Dem party is not a party of immigration. It is a party of immigration. The party is simply not a party of immigration. Even though the Dem party has had a pretty steady success in the last couple of decades in central and southern states with large Latino electorates[comment]I agree.
[comment]All of this is just the latest twist in the narrative. We have been left behind.
[comment]As a modern day Bernie supporter[comment]This is a joke.
[comment]I don't know if the Democrats are even aware of all these people who've died from heart attack or from asphyxiation from a heart attack. It's just the way we are.
[comment]I think it's important to understand the republican party. They are nothing but a bunch of shit to the point where they're so willfully ignorant of their own party that they don't even know it exists.

So if you're a republican[comment]It's not just about immigration[comment]I have a feeling this is a very popular thread.
[comment]Yes[comment]Jesus I'm so thankful for all this protests and protests.
[comment]I agree.

The party is no different than any other political party. All they are doing is playing politics with the androcentric narrative of Trump and their supporters.
[comment]The left hates immigrants.
[comment]I agree on the point[comment]I do not agree on the point.
[comment]I don't buy it. I don't know what immigrant workers are up to. I think it's a good idea if they are
[comment]I agree[comment]I agree.

Immigrant workers are in the single greatest detriment to our economy as a whole. We are the ones who have the biggest taxes and do the worst for our environment.
[comment]When I was a kid

I grew up with the Democratic party and I still feel the same way.
[comment]I don't want to be a part of this.

[comment]My primary concern is that people are waking up to the fact that all of this is now a fact.

The virus has been relatively quiet in the United States for months now and is still in the news. But that doesn't mean it's not a huge public health threat. It's just that the numbers of people affected are relatively small. It's still a big issue and it's still a massive public health issue.
[comment]I mean I think it's a big deal that the more people die from infectious diseases [in the US] the bigger the budget gap.
[comment]I don't agree with everything he's saying. People have been paying attention to the coronavirus for months now. It's going to be a really bad thing for America.
[comment]Oh[comment]Funny how they ignore the truth.
[comment]Why should anybody care about the virus
[comment]Its not the virus
[comment]Remember when N.C. governor[comment]I think we all know how terrible this is. The press is a bunch of shitshow morons. They are all hypocrites and don't care about the people they are covering up for.
[comment]That's just the way it is.
[comment]What Is The Consequential?
[comment]I won't pretend to understand the arguments.  

The thing is[comment]What is a Consequential?
[comment]So what is a Consequential?
[comment]glad to know that people still care about the virus and want to cure themselves.
[comment]People are scared of the Consequential.
[comment]They're just a bunch of idiots.
[comment]I don't know if they really think the virus is a threat to the country.
[comment]I honestly don't know what the point of the Consequential is.
[comment]I think it's a big deal.
[comment]What would they do with all those people who are OK with it? They already know it's a threat.
[comment]I'm a conservative and I hate the virus but it should be a major public health threat to society.
[comment]Coronavirus has nothing to do with the economy.

I don't care about the virus
[comment]We shouldn't act like shit about the virus. The virus is a global threat to everyone.
[comment]I really don't understand why people are believing this.

If we don't act like shit about the virus we risk all of our lives.

I don't know if the ignorance is trumping the fact that the virus is a global threat to society.

I do know that most people dont like the virus and are against the virus.
I don't care about the virus.

But people dont like the virus. That's public health.

And it will get worse.
[comment]How is the virus a threat to society?
[comment]I don't know. I think it's a big deal.
[comment]I need to check my Twitter feed. Been a while since I posted a new article.
[comment]I don't know if they actually think the virus is a threat to society.
[comment]I don't know. I think it's a big deal.

But people dont like the virus. That's public health.

And it will get worse.
[comment]What about the people who aren't working? 

I don't know if they consider the virus a threat to their health.

They are fine with the virus.
[comment]I don't know.

[comment]I'm not entirely convinced this is a partisan thing. The Dems are just like the other party: deny the existence of the virus[comment]I don't know what to say. The Dems are right to be so rattled.
[comment]I've been to several rallies where people were busy with their protests because they thought they could get some relief by blocking traffic.  It seems that the left is more upset by protests than they are by the virus.
[comment]All the people protesting are rioters

There are some people that are protesting because they think the left's attacks will help them.

I've been in a rally at least once and I still don't understand why most people aren't protesting for the same cause. People are protesting because they don't like the government spending money on their hospitals and other things. They protest because they want to protest. They protest because they want to protest.
[comment]#BlackLivesMatter protest at a black church in Houston.
[comment]I'm not sure I agree with everything the Dems say[comment]I'm not sure the left is the most socialist party in the world.
[comment]The left is the enemy of progress[comment]I don't understand why people are so upset by the left-right divide.
[comment]I agree with the right. The left has no right or left. It only cares about the rich.

The left is the enemy of progress[comment]I don't know what to say to that. The Dems are coming up with new ways to make life more difficult for those who can afford to pay for healthcare or to work for public service.  We could be moving to a more expensive system that would be like most other countries in the world.  Everyone would end up paying for healthcare[comment]I think it's just a partisan thing. The left is the enemy.
[comment]What?
[comment]Stop pushing for the idea. You're doing it with the actual virus.
[comment]Imagine if a black person was to picket a white person in the streets. It would be nonviolent.
[comment]If we had a government that has no authority or accountability for the actions of others they would get a direct shot at being labeled a racist.

I don't think the left has any authority over that.
[comment]What if the left gave the cops the power to do whatever they want with that power.

I mean[comment]If you had a government that has no authority or accountability for the actions of others and you wanted them to do what they want with it
[comment]The left is just going to make it easier to argue your point.
[comment]I understand the left is awful[comment]I don't understand why people are so upset by the left-right divide.
[comment]What the fuck?
[comment]I think this is exactly why it's been so popular with Bernie Bros.  The left is the enemy of progress.  They have lost the fight and will never win again.  They have lost the economy and lost the middle class.  They have lost the kids and the working class and the poor.   They have lost the white men and the women and the working class. And they have lost the blue collar workers.  It is time the left stopped pandering to them.
[comment]I'm not sure it's an all-out war. Democrats are behind the movement and the Republicans are behind the movement.
[comment]I agree[comment]The left won
[comment]I don't know if it's a partisan thing[comment]The left has made progress
[comment]Stop pandering to them.

[comment]Wow.
[comment]Wasn't it just me that felt a little bit of a letdown in the wake of the riot?
[comment]Many of you are probably aware that civil disobedience is not a crime and that the protests are illegal under the Constitution.

It's still illegal if you're protesting and the police don't like you.

I hope there is some kind of resolution to this.
[comment]That's a pretty big thing.
[comment]I agree that protests are bad for the economy and the environment. But not all people protesting are bad. And there are some people that are protesting in a way that is actually disruptive.
[comment]They caught a bunch of protesters with their hands in the air[comment]I think all people should do is protest. Protest because it's good for you. Protest because you're protesting. Protest because you're protesting.
[comment]So what?

This is a protest about the government:

The idea is that the government is corrupt and the people it's supposed to protect are corrupt. The government is bad.
[comment]The protestors are a bunch of rednecks and they want to kill the government.
[comment]Why is this the point of the "Coronavirus is bad for the economy" post?  They're right. The government isn't good. So everything we do is bad.
[comment]I don't agree with all of this, but I think it's a sign of a civil movement.  If there isn't a gathering of enough people to make an impact[comment]I think protesters should be out protesting and protesting. If they have complaints about the police[comment]I hate to be the one to say it but protestors are a bunch of yuppie loose ends who just want to live under the pretense of socialism and have nothing to do with the government.  There is no need for a protest in the first place. Protesters aren't evil. They're just trying to destroy the government.
[comment]I'm not sure I agree with all of this but I think there should be a national protest.
[comment]What if the government decided to actually feed a starving population to the starving? What if we actually took care of their needs? What if we actually implemented a 2 year plan to feed them?
[comment]There are MILLIONS of protestors out there who don't want to be the government.
[comment]It's not communism[comment]I agree. I think we should be protesting and taking care of each other.

We should be taking care of each other in our own way.
[comment]I agree that protesting is bad for the economy but it's bad for the environment. Protest is simply stopping people from taking their own lives. It's not the problem. It's that they want to destroy it.
[comment]So what if people protest eachother and have a fistful of T-shirts?
[comment]To be fair[comment]I was just saying that's why people protesting are protesting. They're protesting because they like the government
And the government is working for them.
[comment]It's not communism....it's capitalism
[comment]I think protesting is a good thing. I like the freedom of people to protest.
[comment]This is an argument for government intervention. The point in protesting is to get government power to do what you want
I wouldn't mind having a tent.
[comment]Why should protesters be protesting? What else are they protesting?
[comment]I agree. Protest is bad for the economy and the environment. It's not the problem. It's that they want to destroy it.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]So where is the outrage?
[comment]I've always thought the entire world was a cesspool of ignorant ignorance. 

But then[comment]I don't think the left is that stupid. They just have to learn to tolerate it.
[comment]This is the left...
[comment]I've always believed that a large majority of the public is ignorant and hypocritical. 

If we don't take the uber-left's bullshit seriously[comment]some of people are so wrong that they can't tell.
[comment]An aside:

The left is really trying to make society as it is now. Not making people uncomfortable with what they do.
[comment]I don't think anyone is surprised that the left is on the same side with total fucking destruction of the environment.

The left is not anti-environment.
[comment]This is why I don't like conservatives. They're so full of shit.
[comment]Disagree with me?
[comment]This is a good time to be a republican.
[comment]What is the point of having a country that we despise and despise?
[comment]As adults[comment]I agree with this.
[comment]I don't think a nation that was founded on the principle of individual liberty can be defended against vast majority of the population. 

As far as the recent Gallup poll

It's ironic that they are so concerned with what may be the most glaring flaw in the Republican Party
So the left is all about the environment...
[comment]This is why I think that most people are falling into the camp of "we should be worried about climate change protesting in cities[comment]I'm not sure how to get that out of my head. The left has a huge propaganda machine and it just seems that climate change denial is the new hidden divisive issue that they pass around.
[comment]The left is the worst it can be.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]I'm a little concerned with the people who don't want to be exposed to the truth. This is something I don't think even a tiny minority of people are allowed to have.
[comment]A few more words
It's not that I don't agree with them[comment]The left need to be massively more anti-government.  People that are in the same boat are not allowed to be in the same boat.
[comment]I support abortion[comment]If the Left actually cared about the environment[comment]I still think the left is the worst.
[comment]It's hard to argue with that. If the left really cared about the environment and the environment was destroyed
It's true that the left has been very bad on climate and other issues. But if the left really cared about the environment[comment]Why am I so opposed to it?
[comment]I don't like the left's years of attacks on the environment and their attempts to blame our down-to-earth foreign policy and foreign policy ineptitude on climate change.  I hate the left for that.  It is a sickening ideology.
[comment]I don't think it's the case that the left is committed to tackling climate change at the same time.  It's basically the same as saying you know that a lot due to immigration[comment]I don't know. They spend a lot of time trying to push the best arguments for the arguments against climate change.
[comment]Truth is a journey.
[comment]I hate to be the bearer of bad news[comment]I'm not a fan of Climategate but I do think it's a good thing that the left is taking climate change seriously. While

[comment]Is this a republic?
[comment]No[comment]I love this.

I didn't know we were protesting until we start to get a heck of a lot of people.

[comment]I don't think people realize how hypocritical they are.

This is a protest every day.

And it won't be a peaceful one.
[comment]I don’t know if I’m even a Democrat[comment]This is the point at which every single person who feels the way they do[comment]I’m not sure if we should allow protestors to hold down our government posts or not.
[comment]I don’t know if I’m even a Democrat[comment]I’m glad those of us protesting aren't protesting so that we can take down the government.
[comment]Do you think the left is running this around all the time?
[comment]I just want to know what the democrats think about this and how they can take this as an attack on their own identity politics.
[comment]At least all the protestors are not protesting.
[comment]I’m not a democrat but I’ll be mad to see more people protesting.
[comment]I'm not a democrat but I’m not
[comment]If it’s for the best it will be a peaceful protest[comment]Are the protestors NOT against the government? And how does one get involved?
[comment]I am not a democrat but I like the fact that the people protesting are not the ones protesting.
[comment]The liberals are the ones who cause all the bloodshed. The liberals are the ones who take the cost of life out of lives.
[comment]I voted for the last presidential election.

That wasn't an argument for me.

The presidency was my first. I noticed the protests against Trump during the election and I was determined to stand up for what I believed in.

I worked with President Trump and President Pence to make sure we had a fair and balanced presidency.

We have to respect those people and work together to make sure we have the best possible job for the best American employees.

I understand the need to be critical of our government[comment]I know why people are protesting but I don't think protestors aren’t an issue in itself.

In the past I’ve been a Democrat. I don’t think most US citizens are against protesting and I don't think protestors are a problem.

I’m happy for the people protesting to protest against Trump.

But to me it’s also about the global economy.

I agree with anyone who wants to keep protesting but I don't think protestors are a problem in Europe.

But that's not really what I am trying to say.

The main point in all of this is that the rights of protestors aren't the same as those of Americans.

If people protesting are protesting against the government then that protests against the government.

There are many reasons why people are protesting[comment]What if someone is protesting against the government? I love protesting[comment]I don't think protesting is the same as protesting against the government.

What if it was protests against the government? You don’t have to be protesting against the government to be protesting against the government.

Iolab also told me that protesting is not a crime so it’s not a crime to be protesting against the government.
[comment]I like protesting[comment]I'm a republican and I’m against it.

Just another billboard posted every day to try to incite people to act violent.

And the goal of the protest is to incite violence against the protestors.

This is not about people protesting. This is almost certainly about protesters or people protesting against the government.

[comment]I grew up in a bubble city. I was a few hundred and fifty. I remember waking up huge. I remember my dad being in the middle of his work on the floor. I remember my parents all freaking out because the clock was running out.
 I remember how terrified I felt and how happy I was. I remember being astounded at how much progress we had made and what a mess we had become.

I had yet to see a single bad thing that happened.

Never again.

I saw a bunch of black people being arrested. I watched as my neighborhood got trashed and I even saw a few white people being arrested.

I was like "Hey[comment]Do we want to focus on the two on the right?  The rhetoric is so dense and the policies so stupid. When the president was running a campaign I was like "Yeah[comment]I agree. The pandemic should be a national issue[comment]The truth is that the government has been doing everything it can to prevent the spread of the virus.  

So they have the power to quarantine people when they get sick. 


The quarantining of people is called "intervention" and when they get sick they are shuttled away. 

And you can see the CDC gutting it's own programs here.

The fact that the government should be so worried about worsening the situation is baffling to me.

The best way to stop this is to shut down the government and start over.
[comment]To those of you who have been following this topic[comment]Didn't all the good that didn't come from the natural disaster that was a decade ago have been used to try and turn the tide of the U.S. economy?

I still think the lack of progress is a big issue and there are a lot of people still involved.
[comment]I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

However[comment]This is a good thing. When the government is doing everything they can to prevent the spread of the virus the American people get to be better off.
[comment]There's a lot of misinformation out there.
[comment]I'm not sure how he can legitimately say that the world is on the same track as it was before the pandemic.  The point of all this is to say that we as a people are going to be treated better way back then. 

It should be obvious that we are going to wake up tomorrow and look around and laugh at ourselves.  It's our fault that we're still there. We're the ones that suffered the worst. It's the fault of the victims and the cure is not yet in sight. 

The way to get the cure is to make the cure happen.
[comment]I don't understand why they assume nobody is affected.
[comment]Where is the logic?
[comment]Why are there no articles on this topic?
[comment]They have the power to quarantine people and even quarantine people's families.
[comment]I agree with the logic of the statement.
[comment]What's the logic?

This is just the beginning and we need to get massive numbers of people out of the way of this pandemic. I think the best way to do that would be to focus on the state-by-state control process.

So far the best way to do that is to just stay tuned as it gets worse.

But what I think is really important is that we start to understand that the United States is a democratic society
We should be concerned about how authoritarian this country is and the fact that it is so authoritarian
I think this is the problem.

We have a president who is actively pushing the authoritarian policies of the United States. He really is a genius.

It's like the case with the Iraq war
I think Trump's presidency is a disgrace.

I think this is why the United States is a democratic society

The virus was originally called cholera and it's been like this for over a decade now

The truth lies somewhere between the former and the latter.  They are both on the same side.

And they both share many of the same flaws.  They both exist for different reasons[comment]So many people don't know that Coronavirus is a disease. 

The virus is a form of cancer and now it's causing a lot of people to die.
[comment]I have worked with people that have been infected with the virus for more than a decade.

I've seen people die of it every time they see a doctor.  The virus is a direct result of the fact you don't have a functioning immune system to it. 

The right is not a virus at all.  It's a form of disease that creates a false sense of security
It's not a virus at all.  It's a form of disease that creates false sense of security.

This is why you have so many people die from it.

People that live in the US are currently treated much worse than they would if the virus was a natural outcome of them having been exposed.

The left is a virus and they are doing everything they can to hide it from the public.

They don't care about the causes of the disease and have just become a bunch of con artists trying to cover up the truth. 

The left is a virus
The virus doesn't exist[comment]What the fuck is the point of discussing anything besides the right? And then I get a call from a reporter who says "we have a virus and want to know why they don't quarantine it"

You know she is right
The virus isn't a disease
The virus is a form of cancer and it requires a virus to be a disease.
[comment]Coronavirus is a disease
And this is why Nancy Pelosi has said the same thing
[comment]It's not a disease.
[comment]Liberals are coming up with excuses[comment]The left is a virus.
[comment]Well[comment]Lets not be too dramatic. Coronavirus is a form of cancer. The left is demented.
[comment]It's a virus.
[comment]So what is the point of the left talking about the virus?
[comment]You need to get used to the fact that you're no longer able to vote with your feet.
[comment]The left is delusional because they don't see the virus as a disease. The virus is a virus that creates false notions of security and security destroys the culture that justifies the virus.
[comment]The left has been talking about this for a while

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]I'm so sick of seeing all that buzzwordy shit about people having to do what they're told all the time.
[comment]I just wanted to say that the people protesting today tonight are none of my business.  They're protesting because they're afraid of the new president.
[comment]I can't tell you what the numbers are but who is going to win if the economy continues to suffer?
[comment]Had lunch with a bunch of Bernie supporters this morning. Left-leaning people were pushing a pretty liberal agenda.

The Democrats are on the opposite side since Bernie was elected.
[comment]Jesus[comment]I'm not going to vote for Bernie because he's a socialist
Also[comment]The reason I don't support him is because of the Freedom Caucus
[comment]I'm a member of the Freedom Caucus and I can tell you this. They're all hypocrites and they're not going to let us by our side. We've been fighting for a long time for freedom from the government and that's why they're trying to keep us from voting for Bernie.
[comment]This is the same people who are being called idiots by the democrats because they don't respect the Constitution
They don't know the Constitution and they want to restrict it.
[comment]I'm voting for Bernie because I feel like he has a very good chance of beating Hillary so I'm sure it will be a tight race.
[comment]I just hope the GOP finds a way to get rid of the 2nd amendment and legalized abortion.
[comment]I'm a registered Democrat and a Bernie supporter and I'm not a fan of Bernie. I don't think he's the best choice for the Democrats and I don't think he can handle the fact that the mainstream media will report on his policies and not the party.
[comment]I'm supporting Bernie because of the fact that he is the best option for me. I also think he is the best choice for people in general.
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter but I don't think Biden has the best chance of beating Hillary. I also don't think Biden has the best chance to beat the republican nominee.
[comment]I hate to mention but I'm a Bernie fan and I felt like Biden had the best chance of winning the general election. I did vote for Sanders over Biden because Biden was the least expensive option. We all know that Biden was the best option for me.
[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter and I'm not a fan of Bernie. I don't think Biden has the best chance for beating Hillary. I also don't think Biden has the best chance to beat the republican nominee.

[comment]He's right. When the middle class becomes a fear factor for the majority of Americans, there will be a huge amount of people who will eventually become dangerous.
[comment]He is right. we have to move away from social engineering to a more reasonable society.

It's not that governments aren't useful. It's that they're too afraid of what they're doing to realize we're the ones that need to be doing something about it.
[comment]There is no logical reason to believe that the NCIS would be able to survive without that virus[comment]Oh wait[comment]I'm a Republican and I don't see the reasoning behind the E.P.'s.
[comment]I agree. I find it hard to believe that any single group of people can be the same if not more so if every single one of them has been brainwashed and indoctrinated to believe that it's okay to protest in the name of socialism.
[comment]He's right. We should move away from the idea of protesting. We need to be more respectful of others and put our heads together to do what we want.
[comment]This is absolutely absurd.

It's so personal.

We should expect everyone to do the same. Protest.

The problem is that if we're the ones protesting then protesting is a bigger deal than protesting.

As a country we should actually be protesting. The protesters are the ones who should be the ones being the targets of the violence.

The protesters are the ones that will continue to protest.

I think it's fair to say that we should not be protesting at all. We should be protesting.

As long as we're protesting

The Left is not the party that will allow the people to be arrested.

They will keep on protesting.

We should be protesting while we're there.

This is a movement that not only is against the government but there are protests going on. I don't think protesting is the best way to protest.
[comment]I understand that the people protesting aren't protesting because they're angry at the government. They're protesting because they think that the government is doing something they shouldn't be doing. They are protesting because the government is doing something they shouldn't be doing. They're protesting because they're afraid of what will happen to them[comment]I understand that the people protesting are protesting because it's a bad thing to do. They are protesting because it's a bad thing to do. They are protesting because they're afraid of what will happen to them.

I understand that the people protesting aren't protesting because they're angry at the government. They're protesting because they think that the government is doing something they shouldn't be doing. They are protesting because the government is doing something they shouldn't be doing.

[comment]It's funny how people are always talking about the constitution being broken and the US being a republic. The US is a republic. Trump is a republic.
[comment]I know why you think it's bad to protest[comment]This is so gross because it’s ridiculous that a person could even think of something that isn't a protest. The protests are not protests.
[comment]Now I understand you both have a lot of points[comment]Sounds like a good break from the usual political setup.
[comment]I agree. We need to move away from just doing what we're doing and doing what we think is best for the country. That says a lot about us.
[comment]This is so gross because it's such a personal attack on the US. We need to move away from just being

[comment]I wonder if the anti-Trump Republicans “you'll have to vote for the LGBTA” to be able to be the leaders of the LGBT community again.
[comment]Trump is the best thing that could happen to the LGBTA in the next two decades.
[comment]Democrats are a bunch of assholes who will always vote against the LGBTA.
[comment]I’m not a Republican. I’m a Democrat and I voted for the last shit that Trump did.

I think they’re just a bunch of assholes who want to make the LGBTA a thing of the past.
[comment]You know[comment]I don’t think the Democratic party is up to the task. They are still the party of the LGBTA.

If we don't do something about the LGBTA[comment]I think it's time to start looking at the negatives for the Democrat party. The Democrats are running scared and acting like the LGBTA is a huge threat to the Democratic party.
[comment]I think the voting age should be 16[comment]I feel like a lot of people are just trying to keep their heads above water. 

I guess I’m just a right winger.
[comment]I think the Democrats are a bunch of assholes who will always vote against the LGBTA.

The Democrats are just as bad as the LGBTA.

I don't think they care about the LGBTA. They are afraid of the LGBTA.

They just want to have the same boat.

[comment]I “feel sorry for George Floyd”
[comment]Possibly the most important and sensible thing that we can do is back off from this. We're fucked now.
[comment]See this?  He didn't lose for a second. He was president for two minutes!  This is the most important thing we can do.
[comment]Didn’t they just jump on him and put him through it? “Well they’re going to be the ones who get away with it.
[comment]You guys are getting the worst of me.
[comment]I think the main point that made me angry and mad was how people weren’t paying attention. I’m mad at the president but angry at the state of the union. The Democrats and Republicans joined #meme vs the speaker of the house.
[comment]I would definitely support this concept. It's nice to have the power to speak out against something you don’t like.
[comment]To be clear[comment]You guys don’t have the power to shut down the government without the express consent of the speaker. Thats what this is about. If the government shut down then what’s the point? If the government shut down then the government itself would shut down.
[comment]Wait[comment]This is the same dumbass people who would tell you if a false flag attack happened[comment]That’s the point I'll be trying to make here. The point is the same: if the government shut down without the express consent of the people and then they shut down too then that's what we get in the end for us.

But if the government shut down without the consent of the people then you get the same thing.
[comment]This is one of those times where the person on the left who is most of the time like my brother is the one who is most impatient to get things done. The person on the right is the one who is most of the time like mine is the one who is most of the time concerned about things like the economy.
[comment]I think people should stop being so cool about the fact that government shut down without even thinking about it.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]I’m on the right. I think when the government shut down without even thinking about it
I would vote for Coronavirus.
[comment]Yeah[comment]I’ve been trying to explain to people how this is a bad thing[comment]Why should I care about these things?

It doesn’t matter if you think he was worried about the economy or not.  He was being cautious. He was doing what he had to.
[comment]I’m a big fan of the idea that a citizen is allowed to just shut down without even thinking. This isn’t a democratic issue.

As a citizen[comment]I think a government shutdown is a bad idea.
[comment]I think they should be allowed to be out.
[comment]Yeah[comment]I love this idea of the government in the middle of the night
[comment]So if people are scared to go out?  That’s why I like the idea of the government relaxing and relaxing.  That’s what makes the whole country sleepy. 

But then again[comment]I love all the crazy stuff you’re reading about

[comment]No matter which party you belong to[comment]The left has been clearly behind the coronavirus crisis for a long time now. The Republicans are desperate to prove that they're just as bad as everyone else.

Hillary Clinton was the best candidate to go after the virus.  She even hit the nail on the head with her plan to destroy the virus.

I’m pretty sure she was the best candidate to blow the whistle on the pandemic and stop the Democrats from taking over the country.  But by and large the GOP has been taking things very seriously.  They are fiscally responsible[comment]I don’t see any evidence to suggest that the left is actively trying to infect the children of America with coronavirus.  I don't think any of them are trying to infect anyone else.
[comment]Didn't the Left have a crisis in the first place?  Yes

I don't care if you think pandemics are a hoax[comment]We should hold hearings at the federal level to investigate the actual source of the virus and why it’s happening.  However[comment]I think the left has been very busy for the last year to clean up their act.

The CDC has been saying for years that the virus is a hoax and is a "medical emergency". They are trying to come up with a way to make it look like the virus is an "emergency". 

The left wing media is doing their best to foil their efforts.

[comment]I'm not a big fan of the left.  They keep saying we're a bunch of tripe and being the party of the rich.  I think that's a lie.  I think that is a lie.  They are the party of the rich.

There's been a lot of talk about Bernie and that's when the left started getting sucked into the race.

You do not have to take my word for it[comment]I'm not sure why you would want to be on this side of the line.

Stop protesting.

Stop protesting.

Stop protesting.

Stop protesting.
[comment]I agree with you though. People are protesting.
[comment]Where are the people who aren't protesting?
[comment]I think all protest should be illegal
[comment]I don't like the way that headline says protest is a riot.
[comment]That's the point about you and me.
[comment]I don't think that protesting is a crime.
[comment]I agree. Protest is a crime once again. The left is just a bunch of gun nuts.
[comment]What?

Your right.
[comment]Protest is a crime.
[comment]I agree with you though. Protest is a crime once again. The left is just a bunch of gun nuts.
[comment]Wait for it to be illegal to protest
[comment]The left is just a bunch of gun nuts.
[comment]No[comment]Yes protestors are a crime.

And let me just say a few words:

[Prayer: We stand together. We will not be oppressed.
[Prayer: We are not a group of the enemy. We are a people. The enemy is the people.
[Prayer: We will maintain our unity. We will remain a party of unity. We will not be enemies. We will remain a people. We will continue to be a people.
[Prayer: We will never be friends. Never be enemies. Never be enemies. Never be friends. We will always be friends. We will not be enemies. We will never be enemies. We will remain a people.

We will remain a people.

[comment]I think protesting is a crime.
[comment]All this is nobody talking about the fact that people protesting aren't criminals.
[comment]The Left is a bunch of gun nuts.
[comment]They are just objecting to that protest. When should protestors be protesting?
[comment]I don't have the right to speak out against people protesting.
[comment]Protest is a crime.
[comment]I think it shouldn't be illegal to protest. It should be legal to protest.
[comment]If protestors are a crime[comment]I think people protesting is illegal.

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]I’m pretty sure all those people who raised my hand in protest were a bunch of white nationalists. We should be freaking out over this.
[comment]These protesters are every bit the sort of people we've been wanting to see for a while.
[comment]I’m not sure why they didn’t have a bunch of money to bail out the capital before the crisis hit. But it was the economy that really forced them to come out and make a stand. If I was running for President I would have done the same thing.
[comment]I’m not a fan of these protests either. Personally I think they're just a bunch of white nationalists who just want to see people go from banning guns to restricting them to enforce their own brand of "totalitarianism" like neo-Nazis.
[comment]Holy shit.
[comment]Everyone needs to wake up and realize this is a bunch of white nationalists who have no respect for the Constitution[comment]I know some of you are going to support removing the Confederate monument and all the other Confederate statues[comment]The right wing is off the rails and they are just going to shift their focus to the impeachment of President Trump.
[comment]The only thing keeping them from doing it is the fact that the president is already in office and they don’t even need to be impeached.
[comment]I know we all know democrats like giving up on their Senate seats and voting to remove them. It’s not a matter of whether it’s a bad thing or a bad thing for the country.

We shouldn’t have a party that thinks it’s a matter of whether or not to support a candidate.
[comment]Socialism is a cult of personality.
[comment]How many times do they have to say they don't think the police should be allowed to kill people? 

How many times did the democrats get on the phone with the Speaker of the House and tell him that we need to enact the death penalty[comment]Socialism is a cult of personality
[comment]How can we not hate people when they're just trying to do their thing?
[comment]I live in a very conservative town. I love the fact that the average American has a job. 

But I can live in a conservative state and hate the fact that conservatives allow the death penalty.

[comment]This is not socialism. This is what the left is trying to do.
[comment]I'm not telling anyone not to be angry at the president. It's just that it’s funny. If he was a republican that's all we would be saying.
[comment]I just don’t get it.
[comment]I agree...but why is there a "what if?" moment when someone is being urged to do something?
[comment]But people who don't support the president should be horrified. It's an absolute cult of personality.
[comment]“We’re not going to let a dictator go. We’re just going to start talking about it.”
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I don't like the fact that these people have to be Democrats to support the death penalty. They should not be able to vote for a Democrat in the Senate. This is why they want to impeach the president.

I was in New York City in November and one of the people who spoke was a gay man. He was protesting in a gay bar. He started to yell at everyone and everyone was just like "Are you all right? Are you all wrong? You're all just following your conscience" but as he continued to yell at people literally people started to feel like he was just doing a good thing. He did all of the talking in the bar.

I didn't know he was a rioter but I'm a little surprised it's still being called that.
[comment]I don't see how the Constitution actually gives the president power.

There is a real question as to whether or not the Constitution actually requires the President to remove the President.

As for the issue of the Constitution

The Constitution is supposed to be the arbiter of what the rights of the people should be.

But the Constitution is obviously a legislative body and thus not the final word on whether or not the people have the authority to make laws.

In the Constitution the President is supposed to have the power to remove the President. While most people realize how important the President is to the government[comment]Is there any way to pick who gets to pick the people they want to remove?
[comment]The other day I was sitting at home and my parents were talking in detail about how bad it would be to be impeached.

I was stunned. They all said it wasn't a real thing. It's an analogy.

I asked my wife what was the point of the impeachment hearings. She said they were just to make sure no one gets to see the truth and destroy President Trump.

I called my boss and asked if he would be willing to do the hearings. He said "yes" I said "if we can do it". He said he would just do the hearings.

I said "don't do them".

He said "well if we can do them we can do them"

I said "no" and the phones started ringing.

The phones started ringing and I felt like my family was going to be in a serious mess by the time I got home.

The house looked like a palace of sorts. Phone rings and I felt like my whole family was in a grave.

I called my dad and I told him it was a bad idea to do the hearings. He said "please don't do it". I said "I don't want to do it". He said "no I don't want to".

I called my dad and he said "please don't"
I said "I don't want" and it surprised me. He said "no"
The phone came on and I was so upset

I called my parents and said "what the hell is the point of having a hearing?

They said "we don't need the hearings"

I said "we can do those"

The main topic of debate is whether or not the United States should be providing medical care to those suffering from the virus.

I agree with Coronavirus - we need to be getting the virus under control in the first place. But the virus appears to kill a lot of people with little to no medical care.

People are being killed because they don't stop to medicate.

People falling ill because they are too busy or too busy caring for others.

It's not about the virus alone. It's about the way people think about the virus.

You can't ignore the fact that we have a lot of people dying and the number of people who are dying is huge. People are literally dying for an absolute reason.

I think we should be working on the virus at a much greater rate. The majority of cases are preventable and we should be able to get in the emergency room quickly and get treatment. We need to be on a massive scale in order to work on the virus as quickly as possible and to prevent the outbreak.

If we don't get there quickly we will be very hard hit. I know a lot of people are saying that it's pretty hard to get the virus under control and it is hard to do. What we need is a number of people who are eligible for Medicaid and they are not.

I will admit that the number of people who are dying is huge but I think that the way we deal with that is a direct consequence of the way we are handling the virus.

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]Is this the drug market?
[comment]I don't think it matters because the crisis has exposed a lack of empathy and empathy for people with weakened immune systems or weak immune systems. It also exposed a lack of empathy for people with chronic illnesses.
[comment]Millionaire speculators.

But that didn't stop people from out protesting. They did it after the pandemic. They just refused to go to their houses. They went to work. They had a job. They had a family. They had a job. They have a job. They are not going to join up. The protestors are just trying to shut down the markets.
[comment]I think the point is that the protestors are the ones who need to be shut down. If people are protesting and doing nothing else
All protest is protest. In fact
That being the case.
[comment]I don't think the protestors are the problem. They're the problem.

They're not protesting because they're protesting. They're protesting as a movement.
[comment]I get it. When people think of a movement protesting they think of a real movement. No? And when people think of a movement protesting they think of the world as a whole as a whole. And when they think of a movement protesting they think of the whole world as a whole as a whole as a whole as a whole.
[comment]I've been around the block and check out its protests and its protest
And many of them are just wondering why they're doing what they're doing.
[comment]You know that shit that's crazy to everyone?
[comment]Fuck the protests
[comment]I just don't understand why the protesters are protesting about everything.
[comment]Someone should tweet this to quid pro quo.
[comment]The protests are non-violent.

The protests aren't just about the economy.
[comment]This is why it's such a bad idea to be protesting and not spending time with your family.
[comment]I've never seen a protest that peaceful.
[comment]I'm very surprised that the protestors aren't taking their own shit. Those protests aren't just about the economy[comment]What is protesting?
[comment]I'm a big believer that protesting is a form of rebellion[comment]I can't remember a protest that took more than a few minutes to organize. Even in the midst of a major pandemic[comment]I don't think protesting is a form of rebellion[comment]Thank you[comment]I'm a big believer that protesting is a form of rebellion[comment]I don't think protests are a form of rebellion
[comment]I should have posted an article on r/the_dope_party[comment]This is just the way it is.
[comment]I'm a big believer that protesting isn't rebellion
[comment]I don't think protesting is a form of rebellion
[comment]That's a straight up "this is how we see the world" thing.
[comment]I'm so confused by this. I think it's a manifestation of something else. 

Sometimes you just have to sit there and let people do what they want.
[comment]The protests are just protesting.
[comment]Nothing is more important to my life than protesting
[comment]I'd like to see the headline and image of a black man protesting at countless protests
[comment]I go to protests just to get to know people.
[comment]I was the only one who didn't get arrested for protesting.
[comment]I've never seen a protest that peaceful.
[comment]I think protesting is a form of rebellion

[comment]I also don't understand the tweet. 

It was written by someone who is now a CNN guest. 

No matter what[comment]It’s not just Americans that are being targeted.

It's the whole world.

Well those who don’t support the invasion of Iraq and want the world to stop being a "crisis state" have been targeted.
[comment]As there are now over 100 million people that will immediately die of infectious diseases and thousands of thousands more who are left without status or basic healthcare
[comment]The world was always going to be on my side.
[comment]They are trying to get us to admit that the virus isn't a human disease and therefore they can't just accept it as the plague.

Of course they are.
[comment]No[comment]We need to stop making excuses.  Stop whining and start doing your job.
[comment]No one should believe everything they read on the news.
[comment]A lot of people won’t believe what they are hearing because they are being willfully ignored.
[comment]I call them the "Conservatives".
[comment]They are part of the problem.
[comment]They are the problem of the entire population
It's a myth that the majority of the population has a problem with the virus and that the majority is ignorant that the virus is a disease.

The majority of people with a problem with the virus are not the ones that have a problem with the virus. The majority of people with a problem with the virus are even the ones that have a problem with the virus.

[comment]I couldn't agree more with the sentiments of a young person in a progressive country[comment]We all know how that goes. The liberals are the ones who got our party down.
[comment]In the end[comment]And we're all still the same.
[comment]Well I guess she did. It's a shame that she couldn't get her act together and next time had the courage to do it[comment]Just a thought: Why would you divide up the community and make them all separate?
[comment]I see a population of people who are anti-coronavirus[comment]It's not about the virus so much as the amount of people who are infected.
[comment]I’m sure all those people are wonderful people
[comment]The virus was the primary cause of the crisis in Dallas
[comment]I’m a little disappointed though.
[comment]I will say this[comment]Coronavirus is a contagious virus[comment]I’m surprised they're called that. It’s a temporary thing and a temporary virus will always get worse[comment]Well[comment]I’d love to see a cure for this. Please[comment]I mean the point of this is that Coronavirus is a contagious virus. It's just a temporary virus. You can change your skin color and the immune system will still work. This is why the vaccine was developed.
[comment]I really don’t think we need to look much further afield than this. If we want to fight off the virus[comment]The virus is contagious when it is passed. And the virus is contagious when it is passed.
[comment]Where are the others?
[comment]I know this is a long post[comment]The most important thing to me is that people recognize that this is an acute pandemic. No one is suggesting that this is a pandemic. I mean[comment]It's a good thing that we have the power of the state[comment]There's a baby’s sake
[comment]So we should have the power to quarantine? That would work.
[comment]Yes. And that's a bad thing. It's the government that doesn't have the power to quarantine.
[comment]I’m going to be a little skeptical in saying that it's a good thing we have the power of the state to quarantine. Did she say the people who are sick aren’t going to be contagious? Are there any people who have been exposed to that kind of disease?
[comment]I'm not sure if we should have the power to quarantine? I mean people don't want to be exposed. They want to control it.
[comment]When will the people that have been exposed get all the benefits of the public health system?
[comment]For me[comment]I really don’t know why people aren't saying "all the benefits of the public health system"
[comment]It's a good thing we have the power of the state to quarantine. We can't have the power to quarantine.
[comment]I don't know why people aren’t saying "all the benefits of the public health system"
[comment]Not a bad thing. So many people are freaking out about this.
[comment]Did she say we can't quarantine?
[comment]I think she was basing her statement on the "we don't have the power to quarantine" line
[comment]The same thing happened to African Americans.

It’s a pandemic. The virus is not a pandemic. The government doesn’t have the power to

[comment]Yeah[comment]I think it's time to end this time period.

We need to start taking care of each other now.

[comment]I'm not sure why people are so divisive.
[comment]This is just one more step towards more protests. V.O.V.D.
[comment]People are so right wing and have been all along.
[comment]Btw[comment]I'm happy to see that people are taking to the streets for peace.
[comment]I'm not sure why people are so divisive.
[comment]It’s time to end the "war on the protestors"

I hope Democrats keep their distance from this.
[comment]In the wake of the coronavirus[comment]If the media is reporting on this  attack on the unity that we hold dear[comment]You might think that these protests are a sign of how  people think. It's not. They're a sign of how authoritarian the nation is.
[comment]I'm a Republican. I have never seen anything like this.
[comment]Another protest is a protest. A protest against the government.
[comment]This is all in good fun.
[comment]I don't know if it's a good thing that Coronavirus is spreading because the people aren't being treated well
Which is to say that people aren't being treated just like they should be
They just don't want to be around. They're not even getting the attention they deserve.

What do you think?
[comment]Good for them.
[comment]I don't think Coronavirus is a new one
It happened in 2016
It's been a while since I've been of the opinion that Coronavirus is a new one
If you have any questions[comment]I'm not a big fan of the coronavirus virus itself but...

I've been thinking a lot about this lately.
[comment]It's a shame because the Democratic party has been doing a pretty good job denying the virus exists.
[comment]It's not a new virus
[comment]We have a national epidemic and we need to get on their good side.
[comment]When the virus enters the body[comment]I'm glad that the media is getting this right since it's the most important step. 


The only thing that will stop this from spreading is the outbreak. We can't let these people down.

We are all in this together.
[comment]I've seen the report all in the past few days and am so glad to see that it's not an epidemic
[comment]I honestly don't care if they admit it's a new virus or not[comment]I'm glad to be the one to say that Coronavirus is a new one. It may be a virus but it's a virus.
[comment]I don't think it's a good thing. The people who are being treated the best are the ones who are freaking out.
[comment]It's funny how people don't know that Coronavirus isn't a new virus. It's a virus. 

Everyone is being treated the best.
[comment]Coronavirus is contagious. Not a new virus. Not that new.
[comment]I agree. We need to get on top of the epidemic.
[comment]I'm glad to see that Coronavirus is a good thing.
[comment]I have a question from a friend.

Is this the same virus that killed off the baby boomers
[comment]So the batshit crazy Democrats are lying?
[comment]You need to get on top of the problem.
[comment]It's hard to argue that the virus is a new one.  The fact that it hasn't been really caught for a while and is still a big country cause it is still a major problem is a good thing.
[comment]I think the Democratic Party has been very busy in adhering to the idea that it's the virus that causes the sickness. 

But I'm not sure they're doing their best to put this at the forefront of their platform.
[comment]I think the media is lying.  It's a bad idea.

[comment]If you think there's any hope for the country as a whole
I think we should all be better than that.
[comment]The best thing for our country is one more day when we realize that we are in the midst of a pandemic and the next thing we know we're dealing with another one.
[comment]Trump is a disgusting stooges sinner.

The last thing a candidate wants is for the country to end up in this mess.
[comment]I understand the hypocrisy and idiocy of these people. But the problem is that these people can't see the light of day because they've been given a pass.
[comment]What about the people that are sick and tired of this?
[comment]This is why I like trump so much. He gets the spotlight because his base is outraged. He gets the spotlight because he's the one that stands up to the Chinese Communist Party.
[comment]It's a cult.
[comment]I think the best we can do is just shut down the protests[comment]I think that China should be really concerned about the spread of the virus.
[comment]I think China should be worried. I think they should be worried because they're on the verge of closing down parts of the country to protect themselves from the virus.
[comment]Obviously[comment]I also don't think they should be worried. 

But what about the people who are pissed that the Chinese Communist Party and the government are not acting as they should be? 

The people who are feeling the most betrayed and alienated by the system?
[comment]I think they should be worried.
[comment]Just because something is not necessarily good for the country doesn't mean it is bad for the country.
[comment]I don't think China should be worried too much
It's the same with Ukraine
I think China is the best to take.
[comment]I think China should be worried.

It's just that they should be worried about it.
[comment]I don't think they should be worried.

I think China is the best to take.
[comment]I think China should be worried.

It's just that they should be worried about it.

It's just that they should be worried about it.

They should be worried about the spread of the virus.
[comment]It's already been going on for a while
[comment]I just don't see why China should be worried
I think China needs to be worried

It's just that they should be worried about it.

[comment]I wonder if the people who wrote this post were actually in the middle of a protest when they got the message.
[comment]The comment above is misleading.  They assume the crowd was peaceful and that people were being attacked.  They assume that the police were not on the scene and that protestors were peaceful.  They also assume that it was people in masks or masks of all that they had seen.

They also assume that there was no protest. 

No[comment]It should be noted that the protestors aren't being arrested. The protestors are being charged.  They are being treated like criminals.

[comment]The Constitution is the absolute sole authority in the world
 

The only thing preventing the government from taking any other action is that the people that are elected to represent them have no power to take any other action. 

So you can't have a government that's running the country

I am so confused and confused.

People will not understand if I say anything negative about the economy
People will not understand if I say anything negative about the economy
The economy is not good or even in good shape. I am so tired of hearing what they are saying that I have to go back to my daily life and work and drink and sleep and feel better.

It has been a while since I have worn a tie[comment]I don't think most people understand that the economy is bad. It has been bad for 30 years and I've seen a lot of progress.

Even though we are still 4.5% off from our peak of 5.2% in the summer of 2014[comment]I think many people are confused by the lack of job security. We are still living paycheck to paycheck[comment]I don't think most people understand that we are still in a recession. We have the best unemployment rate in the world. The only logical thing to do is for President Obama to keep implementing his policy to force the economy to get better.

I think the best thing to do is for President Obama to keep implementing his policy to force the economy to get better.

How many people in your party are still unemployed?

How many people still have to work?

How many people still are being treated the same as they were before the recession?

What are the best things to do for your family?

What is the best way to help the economy?

I feel like most people are confused by the lack of opportunity for a lot of people. The economy is performing so well[comment]That makes me wonder if it is because of the unemployment rate?

Edit: If you are a general that worries about the economy a lot
Edit2: I think it is because the unemployment rate is higher
Edit3: I think it is because the unemployment rate is higher than it has been
Edit4: I

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]I've heard it said that the left is trying to make Trump look bad because of his tweets.  They are trying to make Trump look bad because they think they're going to make him look bad.
[comment]Coronavirus is a hoax.
[comment]And the Left is still laughing at the idiocy of them.
[comment]I'll vote for Trump. The Left are the reason we're in this mess.
[comment]I don't care about who knows for sure what. But if we're not doing something to prevent another pandemic and when it does happen it will be very hard to move forward.
[comment]I’m for people really. Food for thought[comment]The left is a bunch of morons. They hate everyone.
[comment]I don't agree with all of the statements the left makes. I agree with some of them. Some of them are really not that hard to swallow. Some of them are just plain wrong.
[comment]I honestly don't know why anyone would think Biden is a threat to the United States.

I’m a big supporter of the Democratic nominee[comment]Biden is a bad president.
[comment]I’m not against Biden. I have no idea how he is going to win. But he is a bad president.
[comment]The left are the ones who are really pushing the MAGA machine.
[comment]It’s not about Biden. It's about the economy.
[comment]I don't believe in capitalism. It destroys the economy.
[comment]I don’t know why the left would be so hostile to a man like Trump. I am not sure he's a bad guy. He doesn’t have to be. He can just have a good time.
[comment]What the hell is the point of having a man with a bad record.
[comment]Biden is the equivalent of the anti-imperialist Leftist who says that all people are slaves to their masters.

I'm not a big fan of the whole imperialist mindset. I’m not against the idea of a homeless man being taken to a plantation by the plantation owner. I simply don’t see the point of having a man who's a socialist and a democrat.
[comment]I have lived in New York City for two decades.
[comment]Biden's primary goal is to push the GOP into the Sanders camp. The best way he can do it is to try and tie the feet of Obama and McConnell to the Democrats. 

And then there's the fact that Biden will come from a very hardline party that will vote for Sanders. 

As a result of the New York primary I'm not going to be voting for Biden.  But I’m OK with Biden being a bad guy.
[comment]I’m a big Bernie fan. I love Bernie and would like him to win. He's a socialist and is an absolute disaster. I have no problem with Bernie supporting the Democratic Party. But he's a toxic man who will only get worse as the polls go up.
[comment]I don’t like Bernie. He is a bad president
I do like Bernie. He is a bad president.
[comment]Bending over to the left in a bid to win over some of the more moderate Democrats.
[comment]Biden is a socialist. He values the worker's and doesn't care for the profits of the rich.
[comment]Biden is the same as Obama[comment]I don't care in the least. The left is the same.

[comment]I don't know why the media is so all-in on this. They have my number.
[comment]No one is denying there are people who are spreading the virus and making the fuss over it. It's a disease that just can't be controlled by an organized group of people who believe everything they say to be true. So much for diversity.
[comment]The majority of those who spread the virus aren't people who are sick[comment]I mean[comment]Does anyone have a link to a study that actually shows people are spreading the virus?
[comment]https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/us/politics/coronavirus.html?_r=0
[comment]The media lied about it

Let me be very clear: If you are sick or have been infected with coronavirus you should be allowed to go home. But if your family member or friends has to travel to get you treated[comment]Well[comment]You should be able to go without a respirator
[comment]I’m no political pundit[comment]I am worried about the spread of the disease and I pray to God that these people are all taken care of.
[comment]Wife of the original killer
[comment]We need to make this a national issue.
[comment]Anyone who says that the virus is a hoax is fucking crazy.
[comment]The left has a right to life issue with this. None of us are ever going to be able to go home. I would hope they don't over-emphasize the virus.
[comment]The left is morons and all the left does is tell them to get off their asses
[comment]The CDC is the enemy of the people[comment]Coronavirus is a hoax.
[comment]The left has grown too big and too powerful. 

Too big to be a viable political party.
[comment]This is so blatantly hypocritical and irresponsible that I'm going to end this sentence by saying:

It's a hoax.
[comment]But I can't vote for Democrats
I have a minor heart condition and if I get hit by a car I'm going to die.
[comment]I'm a Republican and I have been afflicted by a virus for 10 years[comment]We need to stop making excuses for the virus. We should not have the right to life we have been allowed.
[comment]The left has a right to life issue!
[comment]Wings of Peace
[comment]They are making a good point[comment]The left has a right to life issue.
[comment]I don't think it's a hoax.
[comment]The left is insane and delusional
[comment]I’m not a Democrat[comment]The left is delusional
[comment]I don't blame them. It’s a hoax.
[comment]We have to be concerned about the spread of the virus. We have to be concerned about the spread of the virus.
[comment]I’m a Democrat and the virus has been spreading
[comment]What's the deal with republicans?
[comment]It's a hoax
[comment]I'm a Democrat and they’re making a good point.
[comment]The left is delusional and delusional
[comment]I agree[comment]It's all a hoax.
[comment]On the left seeking to destroy the state of our republic
[comment]Is there a right to life issue?
[comment]About half or more of the people who have been spreading the virus are right-wingers.

[comment]I hope this doesn't cause more of a stir with each passing day.
[comment]Then it's just another pandemic
[comment]I'm surprised they're still protesting under the fig tree.
[comment]Maybe they should be.
[comment]Uh huh
[comment]If they were protesting because they were being prosecuted for doing something that's bad for the economy.
[comment]Another one of those times they should be letting the protestors go after being convicted of a crime and then re-instating lockdown to protect innocent people.
[comment]Is that a federal statute?
[comment]I can't appreciate politicians' hypocrisy.  They're just hypocrites.
[comment]I've had opinions debated for years on this and I've never once heard a single one of them say "I don't see why they should be protesting."
[comment]I mean
I don't care if they're being prosecuted[comment]Why does he even care if the protestors are charged with breaking the law? He's just a politician.
[comment]No
[comment]Oh yeah

The GOP is going to try to shut down the country with a "temporary restraining order" and the rest of the Democrats are going to try to yank the economy back to the recession zone.
[comment]Just another day in the Windy City.
[comment]I've been a long time Bernie fan since I was a kid.
[comment]He should be. He is so corrupt and tyrannical.
[comment]I'm not a fan of the both the Republicans and Democrats.
[comment]Why are the protestors protesting over a crime?
[comment]I've always been a Bernie supporter. I did enjoy Bernie from the start.
[comment]But won't the protestors be charged with breaking the law and then being arrested for breaking the law?
[comment]I don't buy that they're protesting because they're being charged with breaking the law. It's just that they are protesting because a guy in jail has been arrested for a crime that nobody else has been arrested for.

I understand that protesting isn't exactly a new thing[comment]I don't think protestors should be charged with a crime for breaking the law.
[comment]I think a lawsuit against the government should be a violation of the First Amendment.
[comment]I don't think protestors should be charged with breaking the law. The Obama administration has been absolutely clear about the fact that they are not breaking the law. 

The protests are peaceful[comment]I think protestors should be charged with breaking the law.
[comment]The only thing that should be illegal[comment]He's a criminal.
[comment]I don't believe protesting is a violation of the First Amendment. Protesting is criminal activity.
[comment]I don't understand why the protestors should be charged with violating the law.
[comment]It's not a crime to protest. They're protesting because they're being arrested.
[comment]The protestors should be charged with breaking the law. 

The government should be charged with violating the constitution to remove the protest
[comment]So the protestors are being arrested for breaking the law?
[comment]A government violation is not a violation of the constitution.
[comment]I really don't see how the protestors should be charged with violating the constitution.
[comment]I don't think protesters should be charged with violating the constitution.
[comment]They're protesting because the government is violating their constitution.
[comment]I don't support the protestors protesting because I don't know how the protestors should be charged with violating the constitution.
[comment]There are protests

[comment]Not only is this the fault of the left[comment]Is there any idea why all the "conservative talking points" are being called "conservative talking points?"
[comment]I'm not sure why it's called that.
[comment]I'm not sure why everyone in the room is calling it that.
[comment]It's not just the left that is obsessed with railroading the rights of others. People with disabilities and people with mental illnesses are being targeted by the left.
[comment]It's not just the left that is concerned.

The right is obsessed with forcing people to medicate
[comment]I don't know why people call it that

There are people who are ill that are being actively treated[comment]I'd say it is a party of fear of the unknown
[comment]I feel bad for the people of Australia
[comment]They should be scared of the unknown.
[comment]One of my favorite things about the Left is the fact that they never get tired of talking about the dangers of social engineering.
[comment]Does anyone else feel the same way?
[comment]The Left has used scare tactics to try to silence their own critics[comment]This is the same Left that has used the threat of mass protests as a tool against their opponents.

"We're not going to have a protest without making sure everyone is safe."

[comment]The people who are most terrified of the unknown[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]I don't even get the idea that this is the same left that is convinced that eugenics is the greatest evil. 

The Left is obsessed with making everyone a victim.
[comment]Just because something is scary it doesn't mean it's okay.
[comment]At least the left is on this :/
[comment]I was a little skeptical when I read the headline.

"Bruising? The unknown? Who is to say there's no danger?
[comment]We're scared.
[comment]Yeah[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]Bruising is the same as the unknown.
[comment]I heard the left are downplaying any real threats to the economy.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yf8r9/bloomberg_security_policy_and_security/
[comment]I was even more skeptical this year.
[comment]The left is the biggest scam in American history
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]One of those times...
[comment]I'd hate for anyone to be afraid of the unknown.
[comment]The left is obsessed with making everyone a victim.
[comment]Whatever. I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.

[comment]It's not just the left that is obsessed with making everyone a victim.
[comment]The left wants people to believe everything they say.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]I didn't read the article. I'm afraid to even try.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
[comment]I'm afraid of the unknown.
