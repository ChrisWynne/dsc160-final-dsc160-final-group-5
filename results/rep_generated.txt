We are calling on the president to step down and eliminate the cycle of violence that keeps people out of work and keeps people in poverty.

If all the police killed in this country are turned into bricks, the millions of people in poverty will never be able to rebuild their lives again. We call on you to tell Congress to pass this act, and let the protesters shut down the rioters. ANTIFA will not be cowed, they will go after you and their organizations if they can, and they will. Do you know what they are planning to do tomorrow night in Charlottesville? Riots. People are getting killed. They will do anything to bring attention, and make you look bad, and they will do anything to bring attention to themselves. I personally don't care what they're doing, they're just going to shut down people's businesses and cause panic. It's a joke. Those idiots. They also have a very simple message: "Get inside first, don't run". The police are so good, they won't let any idiot in their right get in their way. God Bless America. I'm starting to get tired of the US media lying and showing this country how little real news they have. The people on one side of the divide are the democrats, the people on the other side are the Nazis. We will never stop this rotten system. The only thing we can do is stop the nationwide protests. Nobody likes a bunch of spoiled brat chucking rocks at the entire population. Welcome to America. Only thing is, we're at the end of the road just now. The other day I was sitting in my living room watching The Amazing Race and my couch caught a giant swing swing. I got so mad I went outside to look and saw this is the same swing happen to people in the street. I was burning my television and my computer and my cell

Here is a list of what I think will be the most effective posters in a month:

1) Rape victim blaming. 

2) Murder by cop. 
3) No jail time for Floyd. 

4) Floyd was wrongfully convicted. 

5) All the cases are dropped.

Please excuse me as I'm starting to question your understanding of reddit.  And we have never posted a message of support for each other.  So you're not actually advocating for the Police to shoot people in the streets as you claim? You think the police should shoot people riotous?  You're so full of shit.  The irony is that you are.  The police who similarly killed a man with a gun and then waited for him to get away while others were on the floor to calm him down.  You claim to represent peaceful protesters, and we wouldn't be happy about your own inaction at this point.  If you are peaceful, then we will use your protests against us as justification for shooting.  We are not.  We are peaceful.  Yes, we are.  We have a police chief who runs a department that is run by one of the three greats of police: Hoover, deBoer, and now he needs to step down.  This is the same police chief who is blaming the Black community for the violence that has been taking place in the Black community.  He should step down.  The media is full of him.  He should step down.  There are people in your rioters who will be on probation for a decade or more and you suggest they get on the internet and order the cops to shoot them.  They are not inherently bad, they are just doing something different that may not be productive for your cause.   So please do the research before posting.  Please don't make the same arguments over multiple posts.  It's very difficult for anyone to disagree and still agree with something you posted.  The only thing I can guarantee is that you're being manipulated and that these people are angry.  Try to respect different opinions and don't make assumptions.  No one is perfect.  We may disagree, we may agree, we may disagree, we may disagree, but there's no guarantee.

We really need to end this in a meaningful and just manner. It is now our responsibility to stop these thugs and get the message out there, so everyone will know what they are doing. We can end this madness in a way that truly benefits all of us, and just as importantly, all people are protected.

We cannot allow this to continue without enforcing policies that actually benefit all of us. This is a step in the right direction. I hope you can accept that we need to stop being hypocrites and start accepting that we are ALL human beings and can do what we want. Thank you “Twitters user fucktokens” and Reddit user kindergarten” for their hard work.

We will also be putting up some blocks so blacks can peacefully walk down the street however if they see wrong doing this they will either be killed or locked up. All cops are equal, police with different tactics, typically with bad intentions.

We will post messages of solidarity on the main subreddit or message board so that only those who agree can post!

I will make my comments here soon, however this is a fact of life and it has to end right now. We have this problem of 50% police brutality and we are fighting to end this problem, so I will make my comments soon!

You can also make your own subs, but this is a dumb idea (I admit it and hate it) and I will make my comments soon.

I am taking my legal advice from this and will be posting my thoughts when I see them.
