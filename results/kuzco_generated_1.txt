Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I think we need to give it a second thought and think about how detrimental it is to the country's economy.
[comment]Trump is a moron. He has no basis in fact[comment]Facts speak
[comment]How do I know?
[comment]Then they got the President's guns
[comment]And he can get the money to go to jail for doing it.
[comment]Two people out of a million who can't even make it to the polls. This is nuts.
[comment]The only people I know who are very likely to support Trump[comment]We're all in this together.
[comment]I've always had a hard time believing that a country that has so many citizens is so obsessed with the exact same thing as Nixon (though I can't imagine it happening again).
[comment]It's good to see Trump being held in high regard after this.
[comment]Is there any news that rages around in the US that even remotely makes you think this is a thing?
[comment]Well[comment]The President doesn't have a damn thing to do with this. He's the one who has to do all of this.
[comment]Why is the President so obsessed with the Flynn/FBI story?  

He has his head down on a TV set. He has his ass handed to him in a show of force. He can get away with it.
[comment]I'm not a huge fan of the President. I’ll never forget how he told me that he was not going to get rid of the 8chan sub. Then he said that if we don't stop it[comment]The President is a sociopath. He will eventually take over. He will do whatever it takes to get rid of the 8chan sub. He’s a sociopath when it comes to the Constitution. It’s all about the Constitution.
[comment]The only people I support are the Leftists.
[comment]I agree. The President is a sociopath. He would rather kill people than take care of the Constitution. He’s a sociopath. He has his hands tied[comment]Someone needs to tell the President that[comment]I'm not a huge fan of the President. I’m not a huge fan of the President. I’m not a huge fan of the President. I’m a Republican and a republican and the President's biggest flaw is his lack of empathy for the situation.
[comment]The President is the only person I trust and feel is trusted by the American people.
[comment]I have no problem with the President being a sociopath. He’s the President and the Americans are the ones that would kill him.
[comment]It’s mental gymnastics and too much emotion.
[comment]All the trump supporters are lying.
[comment]There is something to be said about it being a faux pas[comment]I personally love the fact that Trump isn't even accused of a crime.
[comment]It’s a lie. It’s a terrible lie.
[comment]I don’t think I'm the only one mourning the loss of the President. The part about his refusal to take action is a huge blow to the Republican base[comment]I don’t think the President is the problem. If he is[comment]I am a Republican who doesn't support the President.
[comment]I support the President.
[comment]I support the President.
[comment]I support the President.
[comment]I have the President on my TV.

I get a call from the President. I tell him the news and he tells me he’s going to take action. When I ask him how he will defend the Constitution I tell him to be very careful. I tell him he is going to move forward in the

[comment]If we have the courage to “start a war” and “start a war[comment]So all the cops are at the same table?
[comment]Yeah but what if Trump is right?
[comment]It’s not so much that he doesn’t have the military but that we have more power. He’s right and the military is the only thing that's preventing America from being able to defend itself from a Trump presidency.
[comment]How does this have any political bearing?
[comment]I’m sure it will be a disaster[comment]I'll be 100% sure that he won’t come out and endorse me. But I’m sure he will. I'm just saying.
[comment]You know[comment]I don't have all the answers[comment]I have no idea what's on his mind.
[comment]Anyone who is critical of Trump/Flynn/FBI is acting like an idiot.
[comment]I’m sure Trump is being investigated for his ties to Russia[comment]It's fine. They can still get away with it. They have to agree on a number of things that they don't like.
[comment]As long as the cops are on the same table as the government[comment]I actually disagree. This is an egregious choice of a country.
[comment]He's a pariah
[comment]It's a shame that he hasn't even been indicted.
[comment]I’m sure the Trump administration is investigating him for his links to Russia.
[comment]I was hoping to see a lot more transparency in the case.
[comment]It's the same thing with the FBI. It's a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and a waste of American lives.
[comment]I'm not sure how they got the grand jury subpoenas[comment]I have a feeling that this will be played down to the coronavirus.
[comment]I’m not sure if the truth will be revealed.
[comment]This is the same guy who says the black community is "taking over."
[comment]This is a very strong argument for impeachment. It's a free speech issue.
[comment]I've been following this story closely.

I'm not sure how he got the subpoena. It was requested by the FBI.
[comment]I know it’s a fake news article but I’m not sure how to feel about it.
[comment]I'm a liberal and I’d love to vote for a republican.
[comment]This is a bad idea.
[comment]The problem with this is that the government doesn't need to be involved in a lawsuit. The government can simply ignore it.

You can't just accept that our politicians are corrupt and/or illegal.
[comment]I am very worried about the retaliation from the Trump administration. They intend to use this as a weapon to attack the president for making a mistake.
[comment]This is a good thing. It will backfire because the police will not be able to stop it.
[comment]I agree with a lot of people that the President is a dangerous person[comment]This has been a long time coming[comment]I don't really see why he should be indicted. He is a threat to our democracy.
[comment]I'm a republican and I agree with this.

If he was indicted he would be prosecuted for treason and be removed from office.
[comment]I’m a republican and I would strongly believe that the government isn't the problem with him. However[comment]I’m a Republican and I don't think the prosecution of the President should be. He's a threat to our democracy.

[comment]The left is claiming that the soul of the investigation into the assassination of George Floyd was trump's.

Unfortunately[comment]The democrats will never admit that their actions were not the result of any foul play by trump.
[comment]Yeah[comment]I think they should just move on to a bigger plot.
[comment]I don't think trump's actions were deliberate[comment]My brother was severely mentally ill and had been brain dead for years. And the cop was impeached (he lost)
I think the main issue is the amount of time the right lies.
[comment]I think trump should be charged with trump's murder
[comment]I feel like the right has been completely misled by the left on this.
[comment]I think trump should be charged with trump's murder
[comment]I agree that he wasn't killed by trump[comment]I don't think trump was as bad as the left has claimed.
[comment]I am in favor of a criminal trial for trump. If trump is charged with murder[comment]The only difference is that this is what happened in San Bernardino[comment]I think the right should be charged with trump's murder

As a republican[comment]I agree with the left on this.

The left has been lying for years on trump. And with the amount of attention they have been receiving[comment]I agree with the left. If trump is charged with murder[comment]I think trump should be charged with trump's murder
[comment]I find the left's focus on trump and his case to be completely misguided.
[comment]They will never admit to the fact that they lied about trump.
[comment]They are going to continue on this for the next few decades
[comment]I am for trump's murder and he should be charged with trump's murder.

The left needs to be arrested for treason.
[comment]Not a fan of trump?
[comment]The left needs to be arrested for treason.
[comment]This will not work. The right needs to be arrested for treason.
[comment]Pretty sure President Truman was not killed by trump.

The left is equally delusional about trump's death as the right.
[comment]The left is an echo chamber. Do not do what they say you should.
[comment]The left has been lying about trump's death for years. This is a partisan issue[comment]Democrats have been lying for years about trump's death for years.

The left has been covering up trump's death for years.
[comment]I'm not a huge fan of trump but I am not opposed to trump.

[selftext]https://thehill.com/opinion/trump-the-politics-of-the-trump-presidency-9e577d0f5fac8[comment]I’m a Trump supporter and here’s what I said[comment]This is the buzzword for the left. No one else has the same level of credibility as Trump[comment]Trump is doing a good job.   If he can get the race close to the end of the year then we will face a much different country. 

He is not as bad as we thought.
[comment]I think we should be worried about Trump losing the popular vote. I think it is a good thing that the democrats are losing because the campaigns are running like crazy. 

The democrats will win and the republicans will be losing. 

I think the best thing to do is try and get a good amount of party unity in the party. 

One of the biggest issues for republicans is getting their party back together. 

One of the biggest issues for republicans is getting their party back together. 

Donald Trump is a terrible president. 

I’m not a republican[comment]GGG
[comment]If we just saw Trump get the election and the presidency back in the bag we would have a president that was not afraid to use the power of the executive to try to get the economy running again.
[comment]Why does he have to do all the work to even be president?

I think it’s part of the job. 

It’s a job that requires a lot of effort and hard work. 

People should get paid to do something they don’t want to do. 

Anyone who has ever supported Trump should be fine.
[comment]This is what I heard from a lot of people. I feel like it’s the right thing to do.

I feel like we need to be able to do what we do well and keep getting better.
[comment]I know what you're thinking.

But the democrats are getting dementia and will probably die before Trump is even inaugurated.
[comment]It's not the job we should be doing.

We should be doing the job that is best for the country and letting the country do what it is best for.
[comment]I feel like we need to have a president that has a lot more experience and opinions than what's in the best interest of the country and not a politician who is trying to make America bad again.
[comment]A lot of people think the impeachment crisis was all about trump. A lot of people think that trump will always be impeached because we should impeach trump.
[comment]The other thing people need to realize[comment]I know this is the same argument that conservative Christians are making.

If the First Amendment exists[comment]I think that the republicans need to be very careful when they say that trump is the trump of the republic.
[comment]The fact that trump was elected is the reason the democrats lost.
[comment]I don't think that the country needs a president that is prepared to do the right thing.
[comment]I should also add that there are more other things to watch than Trump.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The answer to that
The Court has decided that the whistleblower issue is a partisan issue.  This is just another partisan issue.  It is not partisan. 

This is not a partisan issue.  It is a civil rights issue. 

There will be lots of Trump voters who are upset that the new president was not a good fit for them[comment]I just hope Trump doesn't use this as a reason to fire his political opponents and the media.
[comment]I didn’t mean to make this a partisan issue.

The problem with this is that it's a partisan issue.  Trump isn’t a Republican[comment]That’s exactly what it is.

Is this what makes the sordid email scandal a partisan issue?

I’m glad they won’t indict us for trump and trump's crimes.

The Democrats have been trying for years to destroy the FBI and the Mueller investigation. And they have worked.

But now the Mueller investigation is exposed as a coverup. The Democrats have been trying to put his testimony before the American people to try to make him go to jail.

They want a law that will prevent the "half of the country" from voting illegally.

Now[comment]And that's why Mueller is a thing.

What if the two main Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee didn’t want to testify? Why would they want to testify?
[comment]Doesn't matter what the Democrats do with this.
[comment]We need to have a Constitution in order for this country to work.
[comment]This is the age of trump.
[comment]I think that's what the Democrats are trying to make these days. They want to destroy what the Constitution says they can’t do. 

If we do that[comment]Is there any way to prove that the Democrats are lying to the public? 

If they are lying they are just making it look like they are lying.
[comment]It’s fine if the Democrats are lying about the Mueller trial
It's not fine if the Democrats are lying.

Isn’t this the same person who made the same statement that the jury didn’t believe?

[title]Soliciting Trump impeachment: "If he didn’t defy the law and if he was acting in bad faith"

[comment]This is what happens when you try to truly think through the issues and fix things - it's a lot more difficult than it seems.
[comment]I feel like the impeachment process is not the best solution.  I mean the impeachment process is the best way to stop Trump.  If he refuses to comply with the law and is acting in bad faith.  Then the country will be fine. 

The Republicans essentially want to impeach Trump and bring down the government.   The Democrats want to take over and ruin the country. 

The problem is that the Trump administration is being criticized for inaction and inaction on the part of the president. 

I just hope it is not the end of the world for this administration and all the Republicans in the US.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The two biggest issues here are:

1) The perception of the FBI as inept

2) The perception that the FBI is corrupt and ineffective

What's interesting is that this perception is significantly understated in the wake of the Flynn/FBI case. While much of the focus has been on the two major investigations into the Trump administration's handling of the crisis in Ukraine (and the failure of the Trump administration to properly address the crisis on the ground) the perception of the FBI as illegitimate is downplayed. While the Obama administration was accused of not doing enough to prevent a crisis like the Ukraine crisis from escalating into a civil war has been largely ignored.

This is the best argument for politicizing the FBI vs. the Trump administration. The former is a political issue that has been in the headlines for years and while the latter is a civil matter that should never be politicized is a fact.

Or as I like to call it: politicizing the FBI vs. the Trump administration.

The best argument for politicizing the FBI vs. the Trump administration

Ahead of my post[comment]Btw, in the post where I explain how the FBI and Flynn are both dead[comment]Hey[comment]I think the problem is that most American voters don't know what the real issue is. 

So many are falling for the false narrative that the D.C. riots are a linchpin of the Trump administration. 

Not to mention that a lot of these people are Republicans. 

And most of them are Democrats. 

I don't support the idea of politicizing the FBI because it's a political thing that shouldn't be politicized.

It's a political thing that should never be politicized.

Why would it be politicized if it has multiple sides?  

Why wouldn't it be politicized if it has a single agent?  

Because there are so many cases out there that need to be investigated.

Unfortunately for the Trump administration[comment]This is what I love about the left. They are so quick to blame everything on the Democrats.  They demand the impeachment of all Democrats.   It seems like a popular response to the fact that a lot of Democrats are still in power. 

Or to the fact that most Republicans are still in power. 

I love how the left can push their ideology.  They think the only way to defeat a party is to have the party unite behind them.  The Democratic Party has always been a socialist party and it has been a liberal party since the founding of the republic. 

It has been a socialist party since the 1930s. 

And this is why the party was founded in the first place[comment]I agree[comment]The left is coming for the President.

Just a thought[comment]I think this is what I like about the left. They have a different perspective than the Dems.  They don't like the fact that the Democrats have been working to make Trump look bad[comment]The left is a bunch of morons.
[comment]I suspect that this one will go viral because of how many people on the right have actually voted for Trump[comment]I don't think the left should be calling themselves the party of law and order and Democrats should be calling themselves the party of civil liberties and people of color. 

The Republicans should be calling themselves the party of civil liberties and others of color.
[comment]I wouldn't call them the party of law and order[comment]Trump is the greatest threat to the country. Not only is he a criminal[comment]Trump is the greatest threat to the country. Not only is he a criminal

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

As you know the USSOCI has been under assault from both sides over the last few months. Our leadership is clueless and has completely ignored the American people at this point in time.

We are losing elections because of the short term and we are losing elections because of the long term.

&gt;

The right has been playing the trump card for the last couple of weeks with a white supremacist group that is trying to use the Supreme Court to try to unduly influence the outcome of the US elections.

The Democrats are doing a lot of damage to our democracy and the political system as a whole.

But hey! We have our trump!

Because this is what we live for!

We have a president who is smart as a egg and we have our trump.

We have a president who belongs in jail!

And the rest of the country has been victim to this for years!

The longer the left stays in power[comment]I was thinking of a video of the old Fox News/Hillary Clinton campaign event.

https://youtu.be/yLZKbZ6r5y8
[comment]Trump's victory over the Democratic candidate was a nail in Trump's coffin. He has been working hard to consolidate power. Nixon left office with a left wing agenda and Trump's agenda was to consolidate power. But even though Nixon was in power and the Democrats had a majority in both houses of Congress[comment]I don't agree with all of the trump card but it is a bad idea to let people off the hook. They have nothing to gain by letting people off the hook.
[comment]How long will the left stay in power?
[comment]My main point is that the left has shifted gears from building a base of support for Trump to focusing on the electoral college as a means to get him elected. They want to maintain control over the presidency and replace him as the President of the United States.

The left is very partisan and their behavior is very much like that of the republican party. They want to get rid of Trump and focus on the electoral college.
[comment]I will vote for Trump because he is doing a great job.
[comment]The left has been operating under the false premise that law enforcement is the enemy of the American people.  It is no different than the right.  They are the enemy of the American people.
[comment]This isn't a country where people agree with each other. The law should be the law. The Constitution should be the Constitution. The left is trying to create a new world order that is based on a society where both sides are equal.
[comment]You have to be a republican to believe that. 

The Left is trying to create a new world order that is based on a society where both sides are equal.
[comment]No republicans[comment]I agree with the left that we need to focus on the electoral college. That is a pretty big deal. But it also means that we need to focus on the electoral college.
[comment]The left is trying to create a new world order that is based on a society where both sides are equal.

[comment]No.  And the GOP is now joining with Democrats to tear down the Voting Rights Act and the Voting Registration Act.

The only thing that will work is if there is a Democrat-led government and we vote on it.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

Two-thirds of Americans would be watching on television in 2024[comment]The death of more than one million Americans is going to be a huge blow to President Trump. It's a national embarrassment to the United States. It's a national embarrassment to the Democratic party that people take Trump seriously and sympathize with him on a daily basis. It's a national embarrassment that people view Trump as a friend rather than an enemy. It's a national embarrassment that Trump is going to jail for life for his crimes. It's a national shame that the US is so often demonized for its failings.
[comment]The problem is that most of us who voted for Trump are adults.
[comment]Ladies and gentlemen[comment]And the people that voted for him?
[comment]This is the worst election of all time. Everyone in America is completely divorced from reality and the Trump presidency has become a circus.
[comment]What is the point of voting for a man that has been elected president for so long?
[comment]We need to step up and take back our country
[comment]I don't want to be associated with the people that voted for the trump presidency. I'm glad to be a citizen and I know that every single one of you is.
[comment]It's a shit show
[comment]The craziest thing about it is that it even has to be released in the UK.
[comment]I don't know what the fuck is wrong with this country. I live in the UK and I know it's bad for the economy. But if this is the last election that we're going to have a President that's going to be a disaster.
[comment]I think the best way to deal with the Trump presidency is to let Trump take it on his own terms.
[comment]I don't think he's a threat to the US.
[comment]This will be a global embarrassment.
[comment]Trump has nothing to do with any of this.
[comment]I'm a Republican and I agree with this. I'll admit it. I'm a hardcore regional Republican and I hate the US and its leadership. But I will always vote for the guy who would not have done what we did.
[comment]What if the country is not even recognising the fact that the guy that helped build this country is the President?
[comment]I live in a country that has not had a President for a long while. I have to admit that I am quite disappointed. I see most of the right wing coast to the limit. If we want to move forward we need to deal with reality and make Trump look miniscule compared to what we have now.
[comment]I'm a Republican[comment]The left do NOT have the power to stop Trump.
[comment]I have been voting for Trump for years and I was disappointed by his lack of democratic values. I don't think he is a great leader[comment]That was a dumb question.
[comment]I dont believe anyone is worried about this happening in America
[comment]I don't trust people in this country on social media.
[comment]I voted for Trump because of the bad guy.
[comment]I would vote for Trump if this was the last election.
[comment]I'm a Republican
[comment]The left are a cult. I voted for Trump. I'm going to vote for Trump if this is the last election.
[comment]I just think it's silly to think that the left are the party of destroying the economy and the economy is bad.
[comment]The left get people to vote for them

What about the left get to keep what they have?
[comment]The left will never be the same because the public have lost trust in the President and have abandoned him.

They will never be the same because they have lost faith in the President.

[comment]Wife of the whistleblower so let's not get into all that.
[comment]I'm not a huge fan of the case and the usual suspects. I doubt the FBI wouldn't be in a position to use this to their advantage.
[comment]Its a funny thing for people to say[comment]Think about it. Joe and I are both in law enforcement. We are both undercover cops. We're undercover cops and we're undercover cops. Both of us have the same mission: to look for and arrest two bad boys.
[comment]Don't be surprised if some republican voters blame the FBI for the trump case.
[comment]The right is on trial for trump so will they be the ones to blame?
[comment]I've never been a big Trump supporter but after seeing this and seeing Trump supporters on MSNBC accusing those on the right of being "white supremacists" and not "law enforcement," I'm pretty sure I'm a victim
[comment]What if these people were actually white supremacists?
[comment]I hope this makes you think twice about voting for Trump. I don't think the FBI case is a slam dunk for you white supremacists.
[comment]This is really the creepiest thing I've ever heard.
[comment]I think it's a good thing that trump isn't in jail.
[comment]I was thinking[comment]Obviously[comment]I don't agree with all of this so far
[comment]I have a feeling there will be more 'trolls' out there than Democrats.
[comment]I agree. The right is on trial for trump trump.
[comment]I voted for Trump in the 2016 election. I know the Democrats are on trial for trump and I believe there is an opportunity to impeach trump.

The problem is that the left is on trial for trump and every time the left tries to attack trump they are throwing the same old accusations at trump.

The left needs to be very careful coming up with new charges.
[comment]I don't think it's a bad thing for the left to be on trial for trump. It's a bad thing for the right.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I don't know if I agree with the logic of the narrative I am doing and the logic of the facts. If the left turns their back on the FBI?
[comment]It's the same story with the Trump presidency. It's being handled with the same level of skepticism that the right has been on this whole election cycle.
[comment]I've always thought that a large portion of Americans don't trust the police or the FBI and I think some of them are simply getting tired of being told that the only way to protect themselves or their families is to trust them (and they don't trust them a good amount).
[comment]Trump is trying to make himself look bad. We have a president who gets railed for using the police as some sort of weapon to make himself look bad.
[comment]The Democrats have been doing all they can to protect themselves by demonizing the police by saying that they are the ones that are taking the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.

But the people that are most vulnerable to police are the ones that have the least respect for the law.
[comment]The left has been doing all they can to make Trump look bad for the last few years.
[comment]That's the way of the future.
[comment]I don't know if I agree with the logic of this but I think the left is trying to pretend that the FBI and the Department of Justice are the ones that are actually doing a bad job as a result of the protests.

And when the left tries to make it look like they are doing something wrong they are actually doing something good.
[comment]What the hell is the difference between a human being and a machine?
[comment]Did Trump tell Trump to put the ball in the ballot box when he removed the FBI from the White House?
[comment]I don't know if I agree with the logic of this but the left has been doing all they can to make Trump look bad for the last few years.

When the left tries to make it look like it is doing something right it ends up doing something that they are actually doing something.
[comment]The left should take a crack at fuckshirts.
[comment]Well...what is the point of a validating the logic of the left if the effect of the left is to make us all look bad?
[comment]I don't get it. The left is so busy trying to spin the law enforcement situation as an opportunity to make them look bad that they can't think of any other way to explain it.

It's just the left is so busy trying to make them look bad that they can't think of any other way to explain it.

So they're just trying to make us look bad because it's their problem

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
[subtitle]Did they realize they had to send the Navy to Iraq to kill the President?
[selftext]https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/23/us/politics/trump-murdoch.html[comment]I'm not sure how many of you want to believe that they should have sent the Navy to Iraq to kill Trump. That seems ridiculous.
[comment]I don't think it's a good idea to send the Navy to Iraq for doing a bad job.
[comment]It will be embarrassing for Trump.
[comment]How will the US respond if Turkish President Erdogan becomes Trump's puppet?
[comment]Remember when the US was ready to attack ISIS?

It was one of the things we got hung up on. But the US and our allies are dealing with an existential threat from the Iranian regime and the very real threat of a French Revolution in which the US and its allies are at war with eachother.
[comment]The US already has a long list of people that it wants killed by the regime of Iran.

It's been doing this for decades. The Iranians are a threat to the US and their positions are being taken by the US.
[comment]No one is denying that the Iranian regime has a very dubious position in the world.
[comment]I wonder if the Iranians are going to retaliate. 

They have a pretty good policy of not coming to war.
[comment]Flynn is a Nazi
[comment]I have issues with the recent allegations of an FBI informant stealing from a government contract and the fact that they are all very credible. But they are not a criminal act.
[comment]Lock her up and we'll make her pay for it
[comment]I don't think anyone should be allowed to speak out against the officer's actions’s. That's not even the right word.
[comment]The right has never attacked the officers who did something shitty like killing the President. They just didn’t care about the lives of their constituents.
[comment]I'm not sure if Trump really thought the Navy was acting in the best interests of the United States or if it was just a "bad idea" to do so.
[comment]Take it or leave it
[comment]I don’t think this is the right way to handle the situation.
[comment]Damn.
[comment]I don't know what the fuck is going on here[comment]I’ll be the one to take your life.
[comment]One thing that I will point out is that we are not the only ones that are being investigated. We are the ones who are being investigated for being a conspiracy.
[comment]I’m glad to hear that the FBI doesn’t have a "media relations" department.
[comment]I don't think anyone should be allowed to speak out against the officer's actions.
[comment]I’m not sure what the fuck is going on here.
[comment]Trump has made few public statements on the Flynn matter. The only allegations that have been made are that he was involved in a coverup at the FBI.
[comment]Do you really think the public would be hurt if a whistleblower was arrested for leaking information to the press?
[comment]I don’t have a preference in my world
[comment]I’m not sure what the fuck is going on here
[comment]I think it is important to point out that it is the job of the President to order or not to order an action. It’s the President's job to make the law. And nobody else's job to do anything about it.
[comment]I'm not an expert on this. It might be inconvenient for some.
[comment]There is a silver lining to all this[comment]The Flynn/FBI case is a loud, consistent and wrong
====================
[title]
Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

[comment]At this point in the saga[comment]&gt;The wind blows
[comment]Any real conclusions?
[comment]I wouldn't be surprised if there is more evidence of her involvement with trump and the Russia investigation than there is of her being complicit in it. All of this is to make me think that trump and the Russia investigation are being handled as if they are a separate investigation. They aren't.
[comment]I am not a fan of the political correctness yet.
[comment]This is the presidency.
[comment]What else does we care about?
[comment]I am a Republican and have always been against the Mueller investigation and the Trump regime.  I agree with her on many points but as a Republican I am against this investigation and will turn over the briefings to the Warren Commission.  I also agree with the fact that the Democrats are in power
I do not support the coronavirus investigations and my stance is that they should be handled in a different manner.
[comment]I do believe this is a partisan issue. But the war on drugs and police brutality are both the primary reasons for the increase in crime.  And the war on the "justice system" is the primary reason for the increase in crime. 

The president and his cult of personality have been guilty of these crimes and all of the evidence
The fact that the public is being lied to is a gross violation of our democratic system. 

We are all the worse for it
[comment]From my perspective[comment]Maybe she is a corrupt agent[comment]Make her the ones to be investigated for treason.
[comment]I don't think this is the end of it.
[comment]My main concern is that the media will completely cover up her crimes.
[comment]How is this even legal?
[comment]Can't vote for trump....
[comment]What is the logic here?

I don't want to get into the idea that the media treats this as a partisan issue. It's a partisan issue.
[comment]It was the Mueller report that exposed widespread corruption for the public and her office to manipulate the vote. I don't want to get into the argument that it was a partisan issue. I don't want to get into the argument that she was trying to extort donations from the Mueller family to get the Mueller Report released to the public. I don't want to get into the argument that she was trying to cover up the Mueller report. I don't want to get into the argument that she had a hand in the opening of the Mueller report.....
[comment]I would like to see justice for the people she's been accused of crimes for the last 5 years. That's all
[comment]I think it's a good thing to be on the defense side. I think there's a lot of people who are defending the person they accused of crimes. We need to get a lot of people off the defense side so we can get a lot more people off the offense side.
[comment]It's a partisan issue.
[comment]On the other hand
I think...
You guys know what? We'll be fine. 

The only thing that will change is the narrative.
[comment]This is not about me. This is about the media.
[comment]Every time we hear the word "coronavirus" the media assumes that it is a "mild" or "senseless" disease.  The only difference is that they assume it is a "severe" one.  The media is always right

[comment]Just take my word for it...

I think the most important thing is to keep the media out of this. The media is a bunch of lunatics that will do anything to make you look bad to their own ends.  We need to stay away from them.
[comment]No...I'm not saying that officers are necessarily bad.  I'm just saying that they do have to be accountable for themselves.

I think the fake media is just as biased as the real thing.
[comment]But what if they were? They don't need cameras to prove it. They just need to go home.
[comment]I think the military is the trump problem.
[comment]But the media is the trump problem.
[comment]Criminals are bad.
[comment]I'm not a big fan of the false narrative that the media is the problem and that we need to stop doing what we're doing.  

I'm a huge fan of the fact that the left has lost its way and that the right has become the enemy.
[comment]The Left is a bunch of rump old men
[comment]They're going to get their way. 

The media is going to go back to their ways.
[comment]When cops kill people they are also killing innocent people.
[comment]If the left wants to go after Trump[comment]Did we just say the media is the problem? They're the problem.
[comment]The left is bad.
[comment]I don't think trump is the problem. He's a bad cop.
[comment]What happens is that the left attempts to paint the problem on trump to the left.  If the left is not the problem[comment]Did we just say the media is the problem?  They're the problem.
[comment]I just thought you guys would know
[comment]How many times does Trump have to tell the truth?
[comment]The media is the problem.  The fact that he says the media is the problem means his base feels bad for him.  They feel like he needs to be impeached.
[comment]So the left is the problem?
[comment]I think we need to be taking the media's word for it.
[comment]Lets take the case of the Pentagon Papers and the way they covered it up.

The media is absolutely the problem. 

All they need to do is smear the heads of all the government agencies they have control over. 

You can't smear a person by name.
[comment]Well if the media is the problem[comment]It's like when they try to prove that the president is gay. If the media supports gay marriage[comment]I think the media is the problem. The left has lost its way and is going to turn on the country[comment]This is just their way of saying that the left is bad. 

The left is bad because they are obsessed with ranting about how they know Trump is a communist and that the left is the only true left because the left is a fucking cult. 

The left is the problem because while they're at it[comment]I think the left is the problem.

The left is the problem because they are the only two people in the country that truly know what a dictatorship is. The United States is a democracy.
[comment]Yes[comment]The left is the problem.
[comment]The left is the problem because the media is lying and trying to cover up what the other side is doing. The left has been doing their job for some time and still refuse to admit they have anything to do with the Trump administration
[comment]They want to destroy the republic
[comment]As a lefty
You want to destroy the republic?

Step four is to continue the civil war against the corrupt state of Washington.

Step five is to continue the war on Muslims.

[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/the-mvs-mesh-trump-and-the-policies-govern-the-federal-government/[comment]I think the biggest irony here is that this is the election that is so alienating “the left”. I mean it is a democratic election and a republican election. This isn't even a question of whether or not the President Trump would be impeached.

The left is being led by a bunch of people who would rather not be exposed to the truth. A media obsessed with making Trump look bad.

[comment]*nasty*
[comment]The FBI case was a great moment for the left. It was a great moment for the people of the country[comment]We know Trump is a bad president. We know he is a bad president. We know Trump is bad. We know he is a bad president.
[comment]I know a lot of people are shocked by the initial focus on the Flynn/fbi case. It is so much bigger than the Flynn/FBI case but it has become a rallying cry for the left.  It's about any left leaning citizen voting in the popular vote.  And it's about the Iraq War and the Libya War. 

As a left leaning citizen[comment]How many times has Trump said the same thing about the agencies?
[comment]The left is like a joker to the right. They call themselves the "alt-right". Their primary goal is to make the public and the media spin the truth. They try to divide us inside the Democratic party. And the media has always been the same.

When the left is tied down by their base and their beliefs they are easily manipulated.
[comment]I was disappointed with all the (almost) all of the tweets.

The response has been a lot less negative than we had hoped.
[comment]Trump is a bad president.
[comment]The FBI case is a hot topic and seems to be a popular topic on many left leaning social media sites.
[comment]I'm a Trump supporter and I agree with the FBI investigation but I agree that the President was a bad guy and the press was a terrible place to be. I'm not going to vote for either candidate in 2020 and I'm not particularly worried about voting for either.
[comment]The best thing about this is that the left is now going to have to go through the usual process of trying to figure out how to best attack the President and his problems.
[comment]I'm a Trump supporter and that's all I care about.
[comment]I love the left handedness of the left. They do a great job at ranting about Trump and how the media is a cesspool for him.
[comment]The left is a cult and they have no place in the republic.
[comment]The FBI case is a huge blow to the left. They are the most hated and hated agency in the country.

I don't know what the left thinks of Trump.

I really hope they start investigating Trump. It will be a disaster for both parties.
[comment]If Trump gets impeached the left will be in a frenzy.
[comment]Facts?

The left is a cult.

They have no place in the political system.

I don't know if it's a good thing for the republicans or voters to be so blinded by their feelings and opinions about the matter.
[comment]The person who did the killing and now is the president was shot by the Republicans.
[comment]I hate to say this but the election is tonight. If we don't vote you lose.
[comment]I mean[comment]Is this a case of the left and the right being on opposite sides of the dilemma?
[comment]I dont see it here.

They need to go back to the drawing board and start working to find common ground.
[comment]I think it's safe to say the left has been massively downplaying the Flynn/FBI case as the case of this nation is a sham.  They've just been willfully ignoring the fact that the Flynn/FBI case was a very high profile case and that the nation is under siege by the son of a German immigrant family.
[comment]I believe that the left/right are trying to double down on this by making the case that the president was the actual rapist.  They've now resorted to the same tactic by suggesting that the president was the victim of sexual assault and that Trump himself is the victim of sexual assault.

[comment]There really is no way anyone in America should have been killed by a Republican.
[comment]I think it would be a good idea for the left to take a moment to explain what they've been doing.

[title]Trump Says He's 'Not the Bushes'
[selftext]https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/trump-says-he-says-bushes[comment]I'd be shocked if he ever got the same kind of support that was given to Biden.
[comment]I hear a lot of criticism of Trump's behavior. So many people seem to think he deserves because of his behavior.

But there is a huge difference between his behavior and what he actually does.

Now that we are at 5 billion people[comment]I don't know what to say[comment]That's crazy.

It's like saying that the "duh" in "immigrants" are "immigrants."

And the "immigrants" are all "immigrants" with the person who is "immigrants" being a "real-estate agent" or a "real journalist."

In all cases it's someone else that needs to be taken care of.
[comment]Yeah[comment]So this is the best that the left can do for Trump?
[comment]I think he shouldn't have any of the power to act in this way.
[comment]Can I just say this is a summary of a lot of people's opinions and opinions.

I don't care what Trump says or does[comment]I think he needs to be held criminally accountable.
[comment]I wonder if the president is super critical of the media or just general bad behavior.
[comment]I don't see a lot of interest in the Bushes[comment]He should have lied to the American people to get the job done.
[comment]I don't care what he says or does[comment]He is the real deal anyways. He is the Bushes.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

[comment]I know what you're thinking:

I'm a republican and I hate cops. But the big problem with the liberal republicans is that they have very little power over the government.
[comment]I'd like to hear from a cop in your area.
[comment]I don’t think the left is fully comprehending what happened. We are a nation of laws and protectors of laws. I’d rather have people talk about how cops should not be allowed to do what they do.
[comment]The left is sick of hearing cops are bad. The Left has been fighting for years to get cops off the street.
[comment]They’re only after us
[comment]A lot of people voted for Trump for president. No real change is happening.
[comment]Can't win that argument because the left doesn't care about the lives of cops. They just want to walk away.
[comment]If you asked 20% of people if they would support Trump[comment]That's a lot of people voting for the republican candidate. 

I think that all the lefties are lying.
[comment]The left is making an attack on all police.
[comment]They are the ones who are using the death of Floyd as a weapon to use on them.

The left is moving towards a politics of "we're all criminals and we deserve to die[comment]I’m a police officer and I'm a cop. I can't think of a bad thing that could be done. However it’s wrong.
[comment]I am a cop who has been on the force for 40+ years and have never in my life seen an officer shoot a black male. I’m appalled by the amount of vitriol the left has been able to throw at police.
[comment]There is a lot of misinformation out there right now. 

This isn’t a cult video. This is personal opinion based. 

I am a cop and I've seen a lot of bad things. The bias is astounding[comment]I think there was a lot of misinformation in the video. 

&gt;The OP says the death of George Floyd was a justified killing
&gt;The fact that people are so confused about the facts doesn't help.

I still don't understand why the left can't understand the crimes of the two of them.

[comment]My question is on the issue of the intelligence community making their case to the American people that they have done nothing wrong.

I know that the intelligence community has been rolling out this narrative ever since the election. I don't want a government that's waging some kind of war on the people that they believe in.
[comment]Trump says that the FBI was compromised in doing their job. And then the Democrats get involved

Then the Democrats get involved
[comment]The main topic of debate is the intelligence community's involvement in the Trump campaign.

[title]The Left is Screwing Over America

The left is trying to turn you into a political party
[comment]The left is obsessed with this. It has been in power since the dawn of time and it has been trying to destroy us for the last 10+ years. The people that are the biggest supporters of Trump have been trying to subvert him since the beginning
The left has a vested interest in destroying the country and the country is in a state of crisis
If you are a member of the left you will know that the left turns down every opportunity to be a force to be reckoned with.

The left has all the power in the world and has been in power since the day the United States entered World War 1.
The left has tried to build an authoritarian dictatorship to keep the United States from being the world leader it was before.

Their goal is to make America the globalist dictatorship they are now. The left has also tried to suppress the free speech rights of the American people.

The left has become a cult that is running wild in the country. It is making people take the left to task and make them watch their backs. The left is basically a cult of destruction.

The left is the only thing that has any chance of defeating the Trump presidency as it will be just as bad for the country.

The left has forced us to accept Trump's presidency and accept that he is the worst president we have ever had.

The left has allowed this to happen.

The left has allowed the left to continue to destroy the country.

The left has allowed Trump to destroy a country that has had such a positive impact on the world.

The left has destroyed America.

We are the ones that are wreaking destruction on the planet.

We are the ones that are turned into the criminals that Trump is.

The left has destroyed America and now they are destroying our country.
[comment]On this post I will say that it's a little disingenuous to say that the left is "defending" Trump.
There is a right wing side to the equation and a left wing side.

Both are evil.

Both are the enemy of our people.

Both are the enemy of the American people.

Both are the enemy of the American people.

I'm not sure there are any polls that show the same thing. The point is that Trump is the vehicle to have this happened. It doesn't matter who has the power or the money. He can still get away with it.

Do they have a right to a citizen’s right to say what they want?

They just think their list of grievances outweigh the police officer's post-traumatic stress disorder.

It is not a "win" but a loss.

I've always felt that the more supporters the president has
The more people who support him the more he will be able to be seen as the savior.

I don't think we have a president who is a lot more than the actions of a few people
I think the election of a president is about better handling the economy
I think there is a lot of outrage and frustration out there about how badly Trump has been handling the economy.  It's too bad these people have been angry and disillusioned for the past few decades.
[comment]I don't think it's that easy to be a Bernie supporter. I think Bernie cares a lot about the people he cares about the most. The people that have supported Bernie or supported him for president over the last decade.  The people who have been critical of him.  The people who have voted for him.  The people that have been against him.
[comment]The fact that the FBI is being investigated by the Justice Department is somehow giving the impression that it is a criminal investigation.
[comment]I agree[comment]I think there is a lot of outrage and frustration out there about how badly Trump has been handling the economy
[comment]I literally have no idea how Bernie was able to go so far as to say that he was "out of touch" to a lot of people who voted for him.

[comment]The left is denying the existence of any wrongdoing and has a campaign slogan simply "the Left is the enemy." They so often use the accusation of a "war on drugs" to justify the shooting of innocent people.

I think the right is in an existential crisis and the very fact that the left is attempting to defend them from this crisis does more harm to both parties than bettering one.
[comment]I don't have a problem with the left saying that the law enforcement agencies are corrupt. I don't
[comment]LOL The original claim was that there was a link between the Flynn investigation and the election. That seems to be the case.

But it isn't.

I think we need to be careful what we talk about. It's not a crime. It's a crime of the president not the people.

We have a president that has been accused of criminal misconduct and lied about it. He refuses to address the allegations. He refuses to admit that the allegations are being investigated by the FBI. He refuses to admit that he lied and he refuses to admit that he is innocent. He refuses to admit that his consent decree is being abused. He refuses to admit that he has been under oath by the FBI.
[comment]I will keep saying that the left is the enemy. They are the enemy of the state.
[comment]I love the fact that the left is now using the murder of George Floyd as a opportunity to force the right to admit that the left has a moral and military obligation to do whatever it takes to stop the war on drugs.
[comment]The war on drugs was a disaster for the United States.  Now we're fighting against it again.

It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

Just a note: this is not a partisan issue. This is a simple one:

The left has lost the right.

For the moment

The left has lost the left.

The right has lost the right.

So
I think the left has an over-(slightly) short attention span. The right has lost their focus.

For the moment

I have a feeling that many Trump supporters would still vote for the left.

Failed

If the left loses this election
The left will never be the same again.

We need to re-examine the entire case.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I don't see anything that will change the fact that a lot of Americans are very upset with the way the police and FBI have behaved. There are huge sums of money spent on police and FBI right now.

Didn't[comment]The left has been doing their best to portray all of this as a blue-sides-right crisis.
[comment]I think the best thing they can do is try to re-seat President Trump. He has already lost the popular vote and won the popular vote by an overwhelming margin. The only way for him to win is if we elect a new President.
[comment]The left has been trying to smear the Flynn/FBI decision as a "democratic mistake" and then to show us the evidence of it.

They are just playing the victim card.
[comment]Flynn was a bad choice for the job. He didn't do his job as well as Flynn[comment]The left puts all their baggage in the public narrative of the Flynn/FBI decision.
[comment]Did I mention they've been saying for months that all of this is a "witch hunt" and that any investigation into Russia is bad?

The left has been trying to paint this as a "witch hunt" over the last few years because the Democrats are so proud of their past incompetence and Trump is so famous for his incompetence.

The truth is they're just trying to smear the president. They don't care about the public. They care about the messenger.
[comment]I think the Democrats have lost the public's minds. They look at the Flynn/FBI decision as a political fraud and they don't even know what that is.

It's like telling a child that the color of their hair is pink because they're afraid of what's in their mouth.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]I think the left has lost the public's minds. They really aren't concerned about the consequences of what happened with George Flynn. They're concerned about what happens to the investigation after that and their public perception of the situation.
[comment]I think the left has lost the public's minds.

The left is trying to smear the president as the "Russian president" or something along those lines.
[comment]The left actually has a narrative that it goes back to the 19th century and then to Russia.

Flynn was a bad choice for the job. He didn't do his job as well as Flynn and the Democrats are so blinded by their ignorance and hatred of the Constitution and the rule of law that they cannot see through their own narrow lenses.

The left believes that the left is dishonest and manipul[comment]I think the left is blinded by their hatred for the Constitution.
[comment]I think the left has lost their minds.
[comment]I think they're just trying to paint the president as a "Russian puppet"
[comment]There's a lot of false information out there.
[comment]The left has lost their minds.

[I think the left is blind to the fact that these people are still active in the government. They are just trying to get their assessucked by the Democratic Party and the next President of the United States.
[comment]The left is just trying to paint the president as a Russia thing.
[comment]I think Trump is not a puppet. He is a puppet of the Democrats. He has the power to destroy the country and there is a very good chance he will not be able to do that.

He is a puppet of the Democrats.
[comment]The left knows this and has been trying to smear the president ever since.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I think the most important thing is that the right and the left both understand that their actions are the result of misinformation. They see it as a result of the wrong information being spread and are unable to handle it. They see it as a blatant cover-up to cover up their own wrongdoing.

From a legal perspective
I don't understand how anyone can justify an attack that's made by a cop who kills his old friend on the job.

From a political perspective
I don't see how a lawsuit over fake news is the right way to go.
[comment]What the hell?
[comment]I think the biggest problem is our electoral system.

We've seen the exact opposite for the last 4 decades.

We're getting rid of the democratic central government
They literally have no interest in taking votes from the people
A lot of people are still happy to vote without any cost to themselves[comment]I think the main thing is that democrats are mentally challenged and don't care about the people.

They just want to make sure that their candidate gets nominated and that their money gets funneled to the winner[comment]I agree. The officer who killed George Floyd was clearly an honest citizen
But the number of people that actually believe in the truth of the story is down and the number of people that actually believe in the story is up.
[comment]This article is a total ruse by the left. It doesn't need to be in order for it to be a legitimate article.
[comment]I think it's fair to say that the right is doing their best to distance themselves from this “ignorance”.
[comment]I think we're seeing a revolution in civility and civility is the number one thing that should be said
I am absolutely sure that there are people who believe that the investigation into Michael Flynn is a cover-up or a cover-up.

I am absolutely sure that there are people who believe that the investigation into Flynn is a cover-up or a cover-up.

I am very proud of my family and me[comment]I don't know why the left is so angry. I don't know why they are so popular. I don't know why they are so stupid or how dumb they are. I don't know why they are so stupid. I don't know why they are so stupid.

I'm a huge Mike Pence fan and I don't understand why people are so mad.

But I do understand why people are so enraged and outraged and why they are so stupid. I don't think people understand how terrible it would be if people would just agree and let people get off their ass. But people are angry and stupid and don't know how to deal with them. They are just trying to be normal.
[comment]We need to stop and think about what is the right and correct response. If you are a republican you should be very worried about how you're going to be voted out. You should be very worried about how you're going to be voted out of office.
[comment]They are just trying to make us go away. They are just trying to make us vote for their candidate[comment]I'm not saying that the left is the worst. But they're going to try to make us vote for their candidate just to make us feel like they're voting for their loser candidate. 

For me[comment]No[comment]I think the majority of Americans don’t know how to deal with their emotions. They basically just feel that their lives are in danger[comment]It’s like a child pulling their hair out[comment]I agree. The left has failed them. They only succeeded in inciting a pandemic.

[comment]I don't think the focus of the article is on the death of Floyd or Flynn or the election itself. It was a coronavirus response[comment]I don't mind being a dick, but I just think there's more to it than the death of Floyd or Flynn.
[comment]The four main points in the article are:

1) There was not a single individual arrested for a crime and there was no evidence to support the charges
2) The investigation into the Flynn/FBI case was the same as the investigation into Floyd
3) There was no evidence to support the charges and it was a partisan action
4) There was no evidence to support the charges and it was a partisan action

The focus has been on the Flynn/FBI case and not the election.

So the focus has been on the death of Floyd or Flynn and the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case.

The focus has been on the death of Floyd or Flynn and the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case.

The focus has been on the death of Floyd or Flynn and the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case.

As I said before[comment]The reason I don't like the article is because of the focus on the Flynn/FBI case. The focus has been on keeping Floyd and Flynn in jail while the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case is going on.

The focus has been on keeping Floyd and Flynn in jail while the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case is going on.

I don't think it's a coincidence that the focus on the Flynn/FBI case has been the focus on the death of Floyd or Flynn. The focus has been on keeping Floyd and Flynn in jail while the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case has gone on.

I don't think the focus on the Flynn/FBI case has been the focus on the death of Floyd or Flynn.

[selftext]https://politico.com/news/2020/10/trump-dems-end-impeachment-voting-rights-and-voting-rights/[comment]The point isn't to quash the election. The point is to avoid a total disaster for the country.
[comment]There's only so many days until Election Day.
[comment]I’m not sure where the heck we’re at as long as they take a long shot
[comment]I am surprised the Democrats are even talking about impeachment.
[comment]I’m not even sure if they should try.
[comment]Just a heads up. The vote will be on Election Day.
[comment]“Is there any way that the president can take the oath of office without any form of background checks?”
[comment]It's a very simple question: What happens if the president doesn't have a criminal record?

That's the basic logic of the president.

Since that time or so
The president

The people

The Constitution

The only way the courts can stop him from violating them is if he uses executive power to ban guns or suppress the voting rights of others. The fact that there are no restrictions on the president's power to restrict the rights of others is an unfair and criminal interpretation of a democratic republic.
[comment]I like the fact that the Constitution doesn't say anything about impeaching the president. It says nothing about impeachment.
[comment]I'm a Republican and I still believe in the Constitution.
[comment]I think they should use the same argument they used on CNN at the beginning.

Trump has used the judiciary in the past to suppress free speech and keep the people from exercising their rights. But the courts have now been used to suppress what the president is trying to do with the Constitution.

When they used the courts to suppress free speech[comment]The voter ID laws don’t really do anything to stop him from violating the Constitution. The only thing they do is make that the law they want to enforce.
[comment]I'm very skeptical of these claims.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I believe the Constitution does not say anything against the president exercising executive powers.
[comment]I'm not a huge fan of the court and I won't vote for Trump. But this is not fair.
[comment]I also don’t think trump is violating the Constitution by allowing the use of executive power.
[comment]I agree with the Constitution. But I don't think trump is violating the Constitution. But this is not fair.
[comment]I’m not a fan of the courts. I think the courts are just too partisan. And the courts are just too partisan. 

It's just not fair to suggest that trump is violating the constitution.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I don't believe trump is violating the Constitution. But if he was violating the constitution it could be a civil case or something.
[comment]I think trump is violating the Constitution. I mean[comment]Yea. It would be fair to say he's violating the Constitution by restricting free speech and let the people try to enact their own agendas.
[comment]I don’t like the way they've been doing this for years. The fact that the public wants to know what the president is doing is a great thing.
[comment]I agree. But[comment]They don't even have the power to do that.

Have the courts now?

The only way to stop that is to make it illegal for someone else to do that.
[comment]I think it would be fair to say that trump is violating the Constitution by restricting the free speech of others.

[comment]I don’t hate Trump and I think the FBI and Flynn should be terminated. But I think the support for the FBI outweighs the number of people who are deeply disgusted with this administration.
[comment]I disagree with this sentiment. When the Democrats control congress[comment]I’m a conservative and vote for the GOP[comment]Republicans should start giving the Democrats hot air again.
[comment][First they say the president is the one who's acting the way he is. That's the way it is.
[comment]I’m a libertarian and voted for Trump. But I don’t think the businesses and the wealthy should be affected by the president's actions.
[comment]I think the administration should be terminated for incompetence. The President is not in the best interests of the United States and the businesses should be treated the same way.
[comment]This is the type of thing that you expect from any incoming administration.
[comment]I’m an independent and I'm a Democrat. However[comment]This is a problem that needs to be solved.
[comment]I voted for Trump and voted for his impeachment. The Iranians are a threat to the United States. It's time to stop our military operations in the Middle East and look at our allies.
[comment]It’s all about the Dem vote

It's all about the Trump vote.
[comment]This is the kind of stuff that should be being done away with.
[comment]I don't think the Dem party should have any influence on the decision to go to the polls in 2020.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I’m a Trump fan.
[comment]There is a reason I was one of the many who voted for Trump.

The economy was booming and people were willing to do anything to get a job. The only issue was the economy itself. I guess that's why Dems are angry.
[comment]I think Republicans should do what any other democratic party would do. They should try to enforce the law at the local and state levels.

[comment]My vote for Trump. Haven't voted yet.
[comment]Exactly.
[comment]I voted for him.  I did not vote for the president. I don't think I needed to.
[comment]I voted for Trump. I don't think it was a bad thing. I've been a Republican for years and a Republican for a long time.
[comment]I don't like the Trump administration.
[comment]I'm a libertarian[comment]I’m a Republican and I voted for Trump.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I'm a Trump fan.

It's not the president who is in the right.  It's the media
The problem is there is no credible official explanation for what happened.
[comment]It's been a while since this post was up...
[comment]I voted for Trump.

I don't think it was a bad thing. But I decided to vote for the president.

I voted for the Republican candidate because he was going to take a very different approach to the Iran nuclear deal and that was going to hurt him in the general election.

[comment]The only thing that matters is the outcome.
[comment]It's not that the president didn't do what he did. It's that the Democrats have not spoken up at all.
[comment]The media jackass reaction to the Flynn fiasco is a lot like the media jackass reaction to the impeachment of George Washington as a result of the Watergate scandal. The Left has been whining about the fact that the president killed a man they actually knew to be a Communist. The right has been screaming about the fact that President Trump lied to the American people about his private plane and his Russian business dealings.  The left has been endlessly lying and partisan all day.
[comment]As a matter of fact[comment]What would hold people back from voting for or against the impeachment of the president? I don't know about you but if he becomes president and the violence continues[comment]We have seen this before. Obama was impeached by the House. The Senate was impeached by the Senate. The House tried to push their "defense" bill through which passed by a vote of 2-1. Not a good sign.
[comment]Why have mobs of white supremacists and neo-Nazis on the streets of Washington DC and elsewhere?
[comment]My entire family and I are both Democrats (so I'm not a racist) and we have been partying for a while now. We both have very close friends most of the time. We have been doing this for a long time now. We are both very concerned that things like the Flynn investigation and the death of our President aren't being investigated and cleared by the Senate.
[comment]The left is actually trying to start a revolution in American politics by having a large number of people voting in their own favor.
[comment]And so[comment]The left is trying to use this opportunity to make clear the fiction that the president was a communist.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I have concerns that with the Flynn/FBI case the left will continue to try and blame the FBI's failure on the Trump regime as a catalyst. They are drawing on the same playbook as the right in their assault on the left.

This question has been raised multiple times in the last few days and I am being somewhat critical of the media for not taking this as seriously as they should be.

I have not seen the media spin this correctly.

The media has basically done their job of tying all of the recent events to the general election and the election itself. The media is not reporting the vote of the people.

So they are not reporting on the actual facts.

If the media really wants to accurately report the real facts on this matter[comment]The left is still burning through their own fuel.

[comment]I think it will be the same for the left.

Democrats will have a strong base.  

The GOP will be a lot stronger.
[comment]What will make the left more skeptical of Trump?

The whole country will be watching closely.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The answer to that is really this: the next two years will be a period of political crisis.  The left will be in a state of mourning because of the fatal shooting of a cop by a black man. The right will be in mourning because of the way the FBI handled the case[comment]How many times has this been said?
[comment]The left will have no chance here.
[comment]The left endorses the murder of George Floyd.

The right endorses the murder of the officer.

And the left endorses the killing of the FBI agent.

And the lynching of the FBI agent is a direct result of the FBI  investigation.

We should also remember that we were all on the same side when the Russians said they would use the death of George Floyd to distract from the Flynn/FBI investigation.

[comment]Most people will never admit they voted for him[comment]I'm not a Trump fan[comment]And let's be clear: Trump did not commit the murder.

But that doesn't mean he was not a bad guy. He was a bad guy who was a bad guy. He was a bad guy who was a bad guy.

He was a bad guy who was a bad guy.

The left is going to try to turn Trump into the worst president ever.

[comment]Is the mainstream media on the verge of starting to turn against the republicans? Im pretty sure they don't support the Flynn investigation either.
[comment]I imagine it's going to be a lot harder for people to trust the mainstream media[comment]I'm glad the mainstream media is reporting how the republican/democratic base is feeling about the situation. That way people will be less surprised when they see the evidence to their own subjective and irrational biases.
[comment]The reason for this is because they didn't want to confront Trump's father or his son when they realized they had been "wrong" about him
They wanted to focus on the bad apples [comment]Wow[comment]I don't know about you but I hate the media. It doesn't make sense for them to be so dishonest and irresponsible.

I don't know if it'll be a good thing for the republicans but if they lose the election they will lose the ability to govern and the ability to vote for the former president.
[comment]The democrats and republicans will always be around[comment]I can't tell you how many times I have read about Trump's impeachment.

But the left is going to get their wish[comment]I don't know.

Honestly[comment]I don't know[comment]The media will always be a big deal.
[comment]I don't think we need them[comment]The left is totally screwed. They lost their mind.
[comment]If you ask any Trump supporter any question from any of their news sources[comment]I think that's why trump was impeached and why he had a chance to get out. The press won't report it and the American people won't care because they will vote for him.

[comment]I don't think trump was impeached and should be tried after his election.

But I do think we need to impeach him. If we do they'll get on his witness because it will be used against him. We should be pushing for him to go to jail.

And if they want grand jury trials[comment]If we don't impeach Trump
Shit if they push for him to go to jail
[comment]I think he was impeached.

But I don't see how it can be a good thing.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

The question is this:

Why is this a good thing?

Because it will only split the country.

I don't know how they can continue to operate in the face of this.

The republicans and democrats are going to fight for the leadership of the FBI and we're going to lose.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I'm not sure how much of this is a negative but it is a negative.
[comment]I don't think the main issue is the police or the FBI. The main issue is the fact that the left has taken a lot of of the focus from the Flynn/FBI affair and the death of the president. It's been a huge distraction from the fact that the left and the right are fundamentally different.
[comment]It's hard for me to believe that the left would be so focused on the Flynn/FBI case. It's hard to believe that the left would be so focused on the death of the president.
[comment]So if they want to make sure law enforcement has the facts straight it's bad for the country if they tout the fact that the president is a political figure.

They already have a base because they have the media working against them. They already have a base because the media is working against them.
[comment]I didn't know this was going to be a major point.

It's been a huge distraction from the fact that the left has been focused on the death of the president.

I think the right has a lot of people in the room that believe the left is a bunch of morons.
[comment]I agree with a lot of people that Trump is the worst president in American history unfortunately.
[comment]The right is in a pretty good position right now. They aren't going to overreact. They're going to be focused on the real issue as opposed to the fake news that they are.
[comment]I don't think the issue is the president. I think the issue is both the lack of transparency on the part of the left and the lack of transparency on the part of the right.
[comment]It's been a busy day for the left.
[comment]What I don't care about is the fact that the left-right divide is pretty small.
[comment]I think the left has been focusing so much on the Flynn/Flynn affair. It's been a big distraction to people trying to keep their heads above water.
[comment]I agree with a lot of people that the left-right divide isn't a thing to be worried about. The problem is that nobody cares about fact checkers or the constitution.
[comment]I think the left is trying to distract people from the fact that there is a massive right-left divide. 

The left has a lot of people who are delusional and don't care about facts. The right has a lot of people who are comprehensive and have no interest in facts.

It's a familiar pattern where people go to extremes for the sake of it. The left is trying to distract people from the fact that there is a massive right-left divide.

The same with the right.

The left has been paying attention every day to the right-left divide
The left has been focusing on the fact that there's a huge right-left divide

The left is making Trump a star. 

In fact

It's been a while since I've even posted a post on this sub[comment]It's like how the left tries to distract people from the fact that the people who are actively fighting against Trump are Republicans who are against Trump.
[comment]I agree with a lot of people on the left and the right that there's a huge left-right divide and they're all trying to distract people from it. 

I think the left is trying to distract people from the fact that there isn't a massive left-right divide and the left is focusing on the fact that the left is trying to distract people from it.
[comment]If the left doesn't want to talk about the right-left divide then they should just not be involved in it.

It really is a very weird situation. 

The left is trying to distract people from the fact that the right is trying to prevent
