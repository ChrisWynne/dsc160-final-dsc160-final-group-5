Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/en/2020/03/31/will-the-death-of-george-floyd-and-the-fbi-case-lunacy-for-the-majority-of-america/[comment]I love the fact that it is being reported that law enforcement agencies across the country are being investigated by the Department of Justice for the deaths of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case. Trump has promised to investigate and punish the agencies but he has yet to do so.
[comment]We should all be praying for the good old days where the FBI was a bat out of all places.
[comment]One thing I know for sure: no one is being investigated or charged for those actions.
[comment]Those who are not black are being investigated by the police or the FBI for actions they do not do.
[comment]It should also be noted that the largest black majority in the United States.
[comment]It is a disgrace to the country that the police departments are being investigated by the FBI for their actions. It should be noted that the cops in those cities are predominantly black. Most of these cops are actually white.
[comment]Not a fan of Floyd and Flynn.
[comment]I don’t know how this could have been handled differently. The collusion and the media attention should be shown to the people who are responsible for the deaths of the individual.
[comment]The whole world should have been outraged. The media should have been outraged. The New York Times should have been outraged. The Guardian should have been outraged. The Washington Post should have been outraged. The New York Times should have been outraged. The Hill should have been outraged. The Washington Post should have been outraged. The Independent news should have been outraged.
[comment]You’re the economic equivalent of the Chinese Communist Party[comment]I get it. And the Chinese influence is huge compared to national politics. But it’s also important to realize that the Chinese Communist Party is not a political party that has been dedicated to maintaining a moderate political platform. It is an ideology that is based on one of two opposing parties: one that has no political agenda that is opposed to the state and the other that is primarily concerned with economic growth and social welfare.
[comment]Trump is going to be impeached.
[comment]As a white man
It's not just black people that have been targeted by the Trump administration.
[comment]The only thing I’m angry about is that the American public is not being informed about this.
[comment]I’m a Republican and I support Trump. I support the president. But I don’t think there are that many people that would agree with my stance on this.
[comment]It’s a shame that everyone is doing this. It’s not like the major media isn't covering this as well as they should.
[comment]I read the article and I’m a Republican and I support Trump. But I don't think there are enough black people for the presidency.
[comment]I'm a 41 year old single man and I'm from Texas. I can't take it anymore. I'm afraid it’s too late for society to take care of itself. I'm not surprised that people are angry right now.
[comment]If you were a black person who wants to live in the country they would have a way better way of life than this.
[comment]I'm a black man. I'm open to anything. I can support Trump and anyone else.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I support Trump. But I don't think there are enough black people for the presidency.

[comment]Maybe it will affect the Republican party in general.
[comment]I wonder how many more Americans will decide to become Republican. 

I wonder how many more people will take sides in the election.
[comment]The Bill of Rights was written by a man who had a past of violent crime.  This is a man who committed violent crimes.

The fact that the majority of Americans are being blamed for the death of a corrupt cop is a pretty big difference.
[comment]I wonder how many more people will vote Republican.
[comment]Those of us on the left should have more of the time and freedom to think about and vote for our candidate. 

If anyone disagrees with this
I don[comment]I don't know who was the main driver for this. The media has mostly been silent about it. And that says it all.
[comment]It would be a major mistake to politicize the death of George Floyd. He was a very dangerous officer. The media's lack of awareness and outrage over the case makes it easy to politicize the case. When there is a death there is always a media headline.
[comment]It’s so sad that we don’t have to deal with a person that so many people have called 'hero' and 'bad' and 'unfit' and all the other name to describe our actions. It’s so sad and offensive.
[comment]The only way I can’t help but think that many people who are not Republicans are going to support Trump. The only way I can’t help but think that many people who are not Republicans are going to support Trump.
[comment]Republicans are the worst at this[comment]I'm not a Republican. I'm a Democrat.
[comment]Keep it up people.
[comment]I think the Democrats are going to get a lot better at this.
[comment]I’m not a Democrat. I'm a Republican from Texas. I have been a Democrat for the past 6 years. I am still a Republican though.
[comment]I'm a Democrat.
[comment]That’s why we have to have more Republicans in the Senate and House.

[comment]I wonder what the hell happened to the Republicans in 2016.
[comment]I'm a blue state Republican and my friends from high school refused to vote for either Trump or anyone else. They were so disgusted by Trump that they had to watch the Republican Party do nothing.
[comment]I'm a Republican from Georgia and thought it would be a good idea to vote for a socialist. 

It turns out I couldn't really vote for a republican and I left the party in high school.

I think the right will see it as an opportunity to make a big deal out of something that was a pretty major investigation and a fairly minor one. Otherwise it's like the whole liberal media and the right argue that this is the right thing to do. In reality the left simply dismisses the whole thing because the investigation was a big success and we don't know where it will go.

I don't know the actual facts of the case or the amount of money it was involved with.
[comment]Completely different narrative.
[comment]This is a non-political crisis.  The president and his staff have an independent investigation that is legally valid and has discerned any wrongdoing and determined that no illegal act was committed.  The FBI and the Justice Dept. have a separate criminal investigation and that investigation is legally valid.  I don't think the president is going to be able to focus on this very complicated matter of whether or not a case exists.  The president and his team are going to be able to focus on the actual investigation.  The president and his team have been under investigation since the very beginning of his administration.  Even before the Trump administration launched its investigation in January of this year.  The president is under investigation on a case that is not an investigation.  The president has his own investigation conducted and the fact that he is under investigation is not as serious as the Trump investigation which is not an investigation.  The fact that the investigation is ongoing is just a convenient distraction.  The Trump investigation is a distraction and it is the responsibility of the president to take action to ensure his administration's ability to investigate and punish those who engage in the illegal acts.  The president has taken a dangerous step and it is his responsibility to take steps to protect American citizens.  He has also taken steps to ensure his administration's ability to aid and abet the illegal acts.  It is a politicized fiasco that is a distraction from the real issues.  The president and his team have an independent investigation that is legal and is in a separate investigation.  The president and his team have an independent investigation that is legal and it is in a separate inquiry.  The president and his team have been under investigation for a long time.  They have been under investigation for years and if they haven't been under investigation for years then they should be.  They would forever be under investigation. 

It is not a partisan issue. It is the real issue and he has to make an effort and he has to do that. 

The fact that the president has a separate investigation that is not an investigation is a distraction and I think it is a distraction that is being used as a distraction rather than a distraction as a matter of priority.  The fact that he has a separate investigation that is legal and that is under a separate investigation is a distraction and that distraction is being used as a distraction rather than a distraction as a matter of priority and that distraction is being used as a distraction rather than a distraction as a matter of priority.  He has made a decision that he will not do what the president has done and will not do what the president has said and that is unacceptable.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who would be outraged that he has a separate investigation under his watch but I don't think that is the case.  The president. in my opinion

It's possible the media might become a proxy for the left in some way.

[comment]“I’m sorry. I’m not the president.”
[comment]This is the biggest lie I've ever heard.
[comment]It’s not the health of the president that determines the president's health.  It’s the health of the president.  This is the best I've ever heard.
[comment]This is ridiculous.  I honestly think that when the president is sick[comment]The president is not the president.  The president is allowed to be the president.  The president is allowed to be the president.  The president is allowed to be the president.  The president makes him the president.
[comment]I'm sick and tired of this crap. The Republicans are the only party that doesn’t believe that he is the President.  They say that President Obama is the President.  They would be the party that believes that President Trump is the President.  That the President is the President. 

I don’t think that a president with a president that has been in office for 20 years will be the President.
[comment]I wonder if we'll hear about how the administration has been able to keep the President off the table
[comment]I’m not surprised.
[comment]The President is the President.
[comment]I am sick and tired of this shit. The only party that doesn’t believe that this man is the President.  We have spent the last 5 years on this bitch and she is the worst president in the history of the human race.  We have spent years negotiating with the Chinese government and trying to get them to set up a fast track trade agreement. We have spent years in the Middle East negotiating with Iran and trying to get them to sit on the negotiating table.  So much more.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I am a non-partisan and do not have a personal stake in this.

I think the president needs to make sure that he is following through on this incredibly important and important duty of the president.

The fact that the two sides are so blind to the fact that the two issues are at stake is a blessing in disguise.

I do not support the president finding support among the American people for the investigation into the killing of George Floyd. Even if he does find a way to justify the killing of Floyd on the basis of the evidence against him, I don't think that would be an impeachable offense.

The fact that he is not making this case to the American people is a blessing in disguise.
[comment]Hopefully the country is more successful when it comes to electing competent political leaders. Most importantly
[comment]If we can't trust our elected officials to lead us to a better future then we shouldn't trust them at all. The only way we can trust our elected representatives in this country is if we trust them to lead us to a better future.

I do not agree with the justice /justice system /justice system /justice system espousing this view. I believe that if the American people had elected a competent political leader to lead them and charged an impartial and competent justice system then what would have happened?

I think the reasons you can't trust politicians is that they try to control you and you are not accountable to them. Put simply it is the citizenry that has elected them and they have the power to dictate the way you govern.

As the president I have asked that you not allow the media to run with this view
The media should not run with this view.
[comment]The truth is the same.

Democrats have been unable to provide any evidence of the killing of George Floyd. The media has chosen to blame the president.

The president did nothing wrong.

The media is the enemy of the American people.

The right has been silenced and all the others who have spoken out about the president's actions have been silenced.

[comment]Impossible to believe what I read on the Internet. If you read a newspaper you will see that the president has no power to order the military to respond to a specific action. No way.

The problem is that if the president orders the military to respond and the media refuses to report on the action the president orders the military to shoot down the plane

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I'm not sure what this means for the status quo in Washington. I'm a white male and I'm a Republican. I don't think people are going to change their mind. I don't think the Democrats will. I think they're going to be in a better position to do it.
[comment]What happens with the stupid old black man who killed an unarmed black man[comment]The Democrats are going to beat them and the Trump administration will.
[comment]I wonder how much a republican administration would affect the realisation of the tragedy. 

If the Democrat administration were to come down and defend the president and try to normalise the situation again[comment]I'm glad that the Democrats have a chance to get a good chunk of the country up in arms.

I don't think they have to. They can simply ignore it and let the angry minority fester.

[comment]These people are crazy. They are lying. They are following the same playbook they used to justify killing and burning innocent people.
[comment]This is how we understand people. This is how we understand politics. This is how we understand the media.
[comment]Honestly[comment]I’m just wondering how many more people will have to suffer as a result of this.
[comment]The other day I found out that the DOJ had hired a private company to investigate the matter. I don't know how much they will do[comment]We’re going to be monitoring this.
[comment]I hope the Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of the constitutionality of the death penalty.
[comment]The whole world needs to take notice.
[comment]Make the country stronger by locking up those that commit these crimes.
[comment]I've been thinking about this for a few days. I’m so tired of seeing other people’s deaths on TV.
[comment]I am so sick of seeing dead people die. I’m so sick of seeing people cry. What if we had riots and death by gunshot. It would be so good if people should be able to get up and say no.
[comment]People need to stop and think about what they want to see.
[comment]I don't think this will be the last time someone dies in a law enforcement response. It’s just that people will have to deal with this.
[comment]This has been happening in the states since the days of the New Deal and it was almost a decade ago.
[comment]I’m glad the Democrats are finally acknowledging the right of people to be killed outside of their homes.
[comment]The right of all people to be free to live and work wherever they please is at stake.
[comment]I like to think of this as a right of people to be safe and to be free from violence.  Yes.
[comment]The right of people to enjoy life free from violence is a fundamental right of all people.

Yet here I am
[comment]It’s fake news
[comment]I don’t think the media will ever cover this. The left is still very much a political party and they continue to have an authoritarian ideology.
[comment]The right of people to exercise their right to life of any kind is at stake.
[comment]I think the right should be allowed to keep their guns to themselves or to their children. I think the left should be allowed to keep their guns to themselves or to their children.
[comment]I don't think the left is going to get the same level of criticism that I’m getting from the left. The left is the party of the individual. It’s the party of the mob. I don't think this is the best way to go about those issues.

The war on drugs is continuing. I mean it is killing people and the police are killing people. I'm just not a fan of the military or the cops.
[comment]We have to remember that the military is not the enemy. The military and police are not the same.
[comment]I really can't believe this is happening. The hesitancy to defend the police and the excessive use of force.
[comment]But how many of you guys don't actually think this is a big deal?
[comment]I think that's because most of us are all concerned about the environment and the economy. The police are supposed to fix the problem. They are supposed to do the work. They are supposed to do the job. I mean it seems to me that the government should be responsible for the business and not the government.
[comment]That's good. Why not have a more professional police force?
[comment]It wouldn't be so bad if the police had a civilian commander.
[comment]It's not a matter of neutrality
The officers were not there to do the job. They were there to protect the citizens and to "fix the problem."

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

I think the President should send a clear message to the US government that the actions of the President are illegal.

A clear message to the President sending out the official announcement that the President is not 100% a law enforcement officer.

I suppose I am the only person in the world not to be disoriented by the rise of the far right.

I think it's time to push back against the far right in America. It's a political party that is on the rise and that is very much against the law.

I think the President should ask the American people to stop giving them meaningless, meaningless news about politicians.

I think it's important to stop giving the media all these meaningless news about politicians.

If they're not interested in that stuff they should just realize their political masters are in control.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

It is the job of political parties to use the public's perception of the government as an impartial source of information and to do this. The Republican Party is very much the party of the mob and the Democrats are the party of the elderly. The Republican Party is the party of the rich and the Democrat Party is the party of the poorly educated.

The fact that two-thirds of Americans find the Trump administration and the Democrats to be corrupt and the Republicans to be corrupt makes it all the more compelling to put an end to their corruptness and demeaning of the democratic system.

The fact that there is a lack of a public perception of the federal government and the corrupt response to it makes it so that the Republican Party will be in power only when there is a massive revolt.

The fact that we have a chance to change the way the world works without resorting to violence and without resorting to force just because someone is a terrorist supports the right of people to do what they want and as a citizen.

There are many good and promising things happening in the world and I am proud of the fact that we have had a change of government since the dawn of the republic.

It is going to be a different way if we start over.

[comment]Are there any movies that expose the hypocrisy of the Trump administration?

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

This is a complex issue that has to be addressed. The President of the United States has a very specific responsibility to ensure that the police have the best possible equipment and training to deal with an individual in the event of a terrorist attack.

The Democrats are the only one in the world that doesn't regard law enforcement as a legitimate federal agency. So it would be a little odd to have police in both parties if both parties wanted to have uniformed law enforcement.

The system works and the criminal justice system is very fair and fairly run.

But the question then I have is: What will happen to the many people that have been killed or injured by police in the past decade?

While I don't think there is a single example of police killing and killing people that I have a hard time watching over and over again.

As a citizen I am outraged by the way that the media sensationalizes this situation. It is a distraction that keeps the public at a distance. I don't know how I can blame it on the media.

I am also concerned about the fact that many of these guys said they had a good time and that they are being treated fairly and fairly. That's what the media is hoping to achieve. Unfortunately the media is not covering the reality of the situation and the reality of police killings and shootings.

The problem with the media right now is that it is not covering the real issues. The real issues are the not being treated as impartial. And they are covering things like the death of a police officer in Dallas that they are all over the news.

The media narrative is just a distraction on the part of the Democrats. It is not telling the real issues and it is not covering the reality of the situation.

Let me just say that the media has become a total disgrace to the country. They are not covering the real issues that are being raised. The reality is that the police killings are not the best stop for anyone. I have been telling people for years about the good you can do and saying I don't care for other people's lives. You can do whatever you want and I will not be a Democrat anymore.

And I will not be proud to be a Democrat. I still have friends and family that are Democrats. I am proud to be a Democrat and I will always be.

So I don't know how I can blame it on the media. I don't know how I can blame it on the FBI. I don't know how I can blame it on the National Guard. I don't know how I can blame it on the police. I don't know how I can blame it on the politicians. I don't know how I can blame it on the media.

I do have to say that I am not surprised that the media is covering this. I don't know how they have not covered this. It has been going on for a while. It has been happening for a while and it is not going to stop.

[comment]Trump just sent a message to the world: Don't wake up. End of story.

[comment]I don't even know how I can blame it on the media
[comment]I'm confused. I'm not a Democrat.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The TV news shows are all "news" in this day and age. The discourse is constantly about issues and looks at the facts. The media is constantly debating the issue and trying to influence the outcome. The political and economic environment is constantly changing. How can we trust the politicians to solve the problems they are supposed to solve?

[comment]We have to look at the history of government. Jefferson wrote of the State rights movement:

"It is not a right to be a slave to another man; it is a right to be a citizen of the United States. It is a right to be free and to be governed free from foreign influence. It is a right to be free from a government by which you are not or are not not qualified for the appointment of a government officer, a government officer by which the majority of your rights are in effect; it is a right to be free from private influence and to have power over all the things that are not so called private or private in nature."

That's why we have to do more than just label the police officers and state officials how they are. We have to label them how they are.
[comment]They say the United States constitution is based on the presidency and the Constitution is based on the people.

The Republicans have taken the piss out of the Constitution and left the people to say what they want. The people have given them the power and the leverage to dictate what the Constitution says.
[comment]What would happen if a communist group attempted to overthrow the republican party?
[comment]This is what the USA has become. The left has been campaigning for decades to replace the Constitution with a new one. They are at it again.

What is the Left saying about this? The left is completely ignorant of the modern world. This is the same left that successfully destroyed the Constitution in its entirety and replaced it with a new one that they believe is more powerful and more vigilant.

They have destroyed the Constitution and lost all credibility.

The left has now lost all credibility. They are simply the enemy of the people.

To be fair
The 2016 election is already being called "a fiasco" by the left. The Left is already saying that the election was rigged.

The Democrats are already saying that the election was an "election" and that the DNC rigging of the election was an "election"

As a result of all this and most importantly for the 18 million Americans who voted in the fall of 2016
The left

Unfortunately
There is a long history of racism and xenophobia amongst the left. The left is a bunch of shills who fuck up the country with their own agendas and they are just as guilty as the Republican Party for this.

[comment]I don't know if I’m even a Democrat anymore. I don’t care how many times I’m a Democrat it's never been about real fact. There have been many smart people in our society who have realized that while we are all smart and smart are all able to understand the world and we all understand the intellectual structure of the world we all have a set of beliefs and beliefs and beliefs and beliefs. The important thing to remember is that no one is above the law. Someone is not above the law. And the truth is that the left has a different set of beliefs than we do.

They are less concerned with truth and more concerned with victimhood.

And they take a long hard look at the world and they realize that the more they are oppressed by this kind of power and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I'm not alone in this. I'm not alone in identifying the significant social, cultural and political changes that will occur.

I'm not denying that the left is in a bad spot right now. The left is taking the leap of faith to view the left negatively. The left is claiming that the left is a bunch of ineffective agents. They are the ones who need to be pushed out of the way of the left.

It's just the way it is.

There's an exodus of people who are no longer willing to work for the government and are willing to vote for whoever is in charge.

The left will never let the left go.

A lot of this is really a matter of personal choice.

It's not historically a Republican issue. It's a Democrat issue. I think it's a legitimate issue.

The right is not going to allow it to take that much of a toll or influence the political system. It's a political issue and a social issue. The right party is not going to allow it.

The left isn't going to allow it to take the toll.

The left is a bunch of kids who are very good at math and they're not a great strategist. They're all very smart kids. They're all very nice kids. They're all very good at math.

They're all very good at politics. They're all very smart.

I’ve seen groups of people in the media that were very critical of this and were calling for the FBI to resign and for the president to go to jail have been active in politics for a long time now.

It's hard to pinpoint the exact reasons but I’m not surprised at all.

The left have been trying to blame the whole thing on the president. What’s most interesting is that the left has been able to deflect the whole issue from Trump by saying that he is a good guy and a good president. They also say that if people don’t like the way he’s handling things[subtext]

I was shocked by how much of the left had to back away when Trump said that the investigation into Flynn is a sham and that the president "never lied to the American people".

I'm not saying the left shouldn’t be critical of the president[subtext]

The left has also been going after the National Guard.

Here's the thing

The only reason the right is doing this is because the left is so hostile to it[subtext]

I don’t see how any republicans would let the president do this to anybody. The only reason I’m against it is because the left is so hostile to it[subtext]

As I said[subtext]
I'm not a fan of the Flynn/FBI case. It's not a sensational story and it didn't really impact the Trump campaign. The whole thing has been a story of good and bad. It's a story of a bunch of bad apples and a bunch of bad apples that are trying to be good and bad. And now the American people are being destroyed by these bad apples.

At least the media has been reporting the same thing.

The leftist narrative was that the FBI and DOJ were trying to make the case for him that Flynn was innocent.

Their narrative is that the media has a bias against the Trump campaign that they can manipulate and manipulate into a narrative that will do them harm.

The truth is the media has been lying and persecuting the people for the past year and a half.

They have been dishonest and have been doing this for a while.

The media has been covering up for the FBI and DOJ
The left is doing the same thing

George Floyd is a good person
He was a civil rights leader who was a proud conservative and a father who loved his son dearly. He had the authority and guts to stand up to the police brutality of the Nixon administration and the police brutality of the Trump administration.

The Floyd case is a reminder that even when we disagree with people or have opinions we all have a responsibility to uphold our rights and freedoms. The last thing we want is someone who doesn't understand how we have the power to take steps to advance our rights and freedoms.

I don't think the left or the right really care about what happens in the political world
[comment]The left are shocked. I mean the left want to believe that the American people are being lied to by a foreign power that is not above the law. The left want to believe that the government is on a mission to keep the economy going and we need to do it. And the right want to believe that the government is morally accountable for the actions of the people.

I can't think of a better way to approach the issue than to look at all the evidence and make a case that the FBI was involved in the death of George Floyd by the same agent that killed the unarmed officer.

The other thing I don't think the left is surprised about is how quickly the left are on the right side of the issue. The left is more upset and more angered than ever before. They have no idea what's going to happen in the next four weeks and they are just as outraged and more outraged than ever before. The left are not only outraged at what happened to Floyd but they are outraged that the police are being held accountable. They are not surprised that the police are being held accountable.

Their anger and frustration is so extreme they are willing to defy any attempt to quantify it.

They are not surprised by how quickly the left are on the right side of the issue.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I think it is fairly clear that law enforcement agencies are fairly understaffed and underfunded. And the amount of time and money that staffs and supplies law enforcement agencies is quite a bit more than it was in the past. The number of employees has decreased significantly. There is a very real possibility that the police departments that are understaffed and underfunded could become corrupt and out of control.

While I don't think a ton of people are saying that any time in the last decade police agencies and law enforcement agencies have been understaffed or understaffed they have consistently lost money. And that was a big sub-comment. But I can't help but wonder if they can recover from that.

[comment]I think the media is underreporting the death of George Floyd. If they are not reporting the death of Floyd they are significantly underreporting the murder of George Floyd.

[comment]I think the media should take this to the person that is most likely to report the death of Floyd as they will be downplayed as to Floyd's death being a random act of violence. And I think I am in agreement that there is a reasonable chance that Floyd died of a heart attack.
[comment]Justice Kennedy in his opinion reads:

* Did he kill Floyd or was he unjustly killed?
[comment]I think that there are several reasons why the media should not report the death of a wild man.

First is the fact that Floyd was not murdered by anyone other than the killer. Floyd was shot in the back as he was leaving the house. He was on his way to a church where he was to give a service. This was a private gathering which was private. Floyd was a good man who had a good home. Floyd's death is either a tragedy or a tragedy to many people.

Second is the fact that Floyd was not a violent offender and that he was not armed with a weapon. Floyd was armed with a weapon and he shot Floyd in self defense. Floyd was shot in the back of the head. Floyd was shot in the hip. It is also important to remember that Floyd was unarmed. Floyd was unarmed when he was shot. Floyd was unarmed when he was shot. Floyd was unarmed when he was shot. Floyd was shot in the gut. Floyd was shot in the head. Floyd was shot in the back of the head. Floyd was shot in the back of the head.

[comment]I agree with these things but I think the media should read more into Floyd's life and to the fact that he was shot in the back of the head. Floyd was shot in the back of the head. It was a private gathering which was private.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The US is not a democratic country and the coronership of the supreme court is not the coronation of a Republican president. The coronership of a Republican president is the coronation of a Republican president. If the question is whether or not the coronership of a Republican president should end at the end of this administration. If there is a coronation of a Republican president at the end of this administration.

I would like to see a more complex political process take place. On the one hand it would be important not to allow the use of force in the name of the president. On the other hand it would be especially dangerous to have a president who is a Republican and who was elected President in 2016.

On the other hand if there is a coronation of a Republican president at the end of this administration.

As a government elected official I think we should have the ability to leverage our political institutions to try and avoid a President Trump. It would be a very dangerous job to have a president who is clearly a Republican and who has a record of violating the Constitution.

Personally I think that the Constitution should be read by the people and not simply the courts.  The Constitution should be a great equalizer.  If people are going to read the Constitution at the royal level then they should read it by the people.

On the other hand I don't think the Constitution should simply be a great equalizer.  I think it should be a phrase that should be used by every American to express their rights and what they believe.  If people are going to read the Constitution at the royal level then it should be a phrase that should be used by every American to express their rights and what they believe. 

I don't think the Constitution is perfect.  I think the word "equal" was used to mean something that should be used by every American to express their rights and what they believe. 

I think the concept of the "equal" is a distraction and a diversion.  The notion of "equal" is also a distraction and a diversion. I think that a great part of the problem with the way the Constitution is phrased and put together has to do with the fact that things that are "equal" can still be used as a distraction and a diversion.

The Constitution is the only body that can decide how to use words and phrases in the Constitution.  The people of the United States have the power to decide how to use words and phrases in the Constitution.

There really is no way to get people to read the Constitution and not read the words and phrases. I have read the Constitution and I don't know what the words to call a country are. I'm not saying that the Constitution is the only body that can dictate how words and phrases are used because I don't think it's. I don't think there is a body that can dictate how words and phrases are used because there is.

In the beginning of the Constitution there was a lot of different words and phrases.  The more words there were there were different ways to affect the situation. The more words there were there were different ways to affect the situation.

The phrase "water" was used in the Constitution and it's like "water in a crisis".  It's like "water out of a crisis".

The phrase "Can I buy a gun" was used in the Constitution and it's like "gun

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I am a Republican and a Democrat, but the fact that a Democrat-led federal agency has taken the lead in the nation on these issues is deeply disturbing.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The Republican Party is run by a man who is a very long-time Republican. They are an extremely conservative party. In reality they are a fairly conservative party that has had a fairly good track record in the past. The Republican Party is basically a party of fear and isolation, with a few moderates and a few liberals.

This is a party that has lost its credibility as a reputable institution that is accountable to the American people and is not accountable to the US government. As a political party it has been very successful in killing people and removing the Supreme Court justices and other important people.

That is why I strongly believe that the investigation into the death of George Floyd will not be conducted by any federal agency or any police agency. This will be conducted by the federal government and will not be conducted by any state or local sheriff or police department. This only applies to the federal government and only applies to states and local governments.

The Trump administration has also escalated this investigation to include the death of David Taylor.

I wonder what the good people of the United States of America will think of this situation. Perhaps the real problem is that this is a man who has a history of racist and sexist acts and is now a president. Maybe the past few months have taught us that these types of actions are "bad" and should be punished severely. This is an absolute shame because as much as we all need to be vigilant in our communities to protect our wellbeing we need to not just ignore the bad things happening in our names but to move on and do better.

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/u9l6r5n2x41.png[comment]This is a really big deal. I think our country is in serious trouble right now. But I also think that the investigation into the Flynn/FBI case is putting the integrity of the country in serious doubt. And I have no doubt that the president will make an announcement that he is leaving office and that the investigation will end.
[comment]Good for them. They brought with them such a good piece of legislation that no one is going to complain about it because everyone is happy to have their rights protected.
[comment]I'm not saying that Trump will not be impeached. I'm just saying that if he was to do so then he would be a hypocrite.
[comment]I don't think Trump is going to be impeached
[comment]I think the reason the Democrats and their propaganda machine has been so successful in this election is because they had a good time in 2016. They were able to use a President Trump to try to get votes for a racist president. Now they're trying to try to get votes for a President Trump. It's a different kind of election.
[comment]And they're now trying to pretend that Trump is not a threat to the republic.
[comment]I think the only real way to defend Trump is to make excuses to the American people.
[comment]Are these democrats really that stupid?
[comment]I would have thought if someone said something like "we are not going to see the impeachment trial of any president until the evidence is as strong as possible" that the media would be quick to refer to the president as a threat to the republic.
[comment]I feel like the reason I hate Trump is because he is an idiot. I feel like he is a liar and a criminal. I feel like Trump is a real threat to the republic and that the country would suffer if he didn't run for president.

I don't think there is a perfect impeachment case. I think that the president is culpable in every way. But I don't think there are a lot of trials that are held to be credible. The only real criticism that the media has of Trump is that he is a garbage president. But when he is not the president the people are going to get angry.
[comment]I get what you're saying about Trump and he's a liar. But I can't help but feel that the United States is in a state of crisis all the way to the end.
[comment]Good for them. Trump is a truly horrible president that has given a bad administration a bad administration.
[comment]I don't agree with everything you have said. But the lack of evidence to impeach Trump has been a good thing for republican voters. The impeachment is a good thing for the republic. But I think that the idea of a president who is so smart seems to not be that smart.
[comment]I don't know I think that President Trump is a threat to the republic.
[comment]I don't think he is. Trump is a lunatic and he's a disgrace for a Republican president. Trump has won the popular vote and won the popular vote by far more than any president in American history. He is the only president in modern U.S. history that has won the popular vote and won the popular vote by far more than any president.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

There are two possible responses to the loss of law enforcement are to blame the Democrats and to blame the media for the loss of law enforcement.

In a recent NY Times article it was revealed that the FBI had been harassing and harassing people on the streets for months for no reason. Then in an interview with CNN

When you say there are no consequences the media dismisses the whole story. They have the narrative of the Flynn investigation as a whole, but it's the opposite. The media focuses on a specific case and the fact that the termination of trade sprees that occur is being investigated for a specific reason is being investigated for a specific reason. The coronavirus investigation continues for a specific reason.

The media has a narrative that the investigation is a specific investigation and the explanation is the same. The media narrative is spread by the media and is a diversion to the same end. The media narrative is spread by the left.

They are a threat to our republic as a whole. The media narrative is spread by the left.

The media narrative is spread by the left.

It's not just that the media narrative has been ruined by the media.
The media narrative has been destroyed. The left has been blown away – the left is clearly a threat to our republic.

There are a number of reasons that the left is so much more than the media:

There is a power structure that exists in the media that can do things that the media can't.

Media outlets that don't echo the left's narrative.

Media outlets that just happen to be honest with themselves and their audiences.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves as unbiased.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves as objective.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a negative light.

These are all reasons why the left is so much more than the media.

Media outlets that are openly critical of the media.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a negative light.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a positive light.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a positive light.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a negative light.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a negative light.

Media outlets that want to portray themselves in a negative light.

And more.

The media outlets that are openly critical of the media are the ones that are being used to advance the narrative.

More.

The left in general is significantly more than the media. The media outlets that are openly critical of the media are the ones that are being used as propaganda outlets. More.

I’m really curious.  I don’t know what the actual consequences will be for the police in the United States. It would be a nice progression for the police to publicly identify the officer and report the incident to the appropriate authorities. 

I don’t know how that would affect voter turnout or on the political side.

In that way the current situation could be detrimental. I think we can all agree that the federal government has a responsibility to uphold the constitution and uphold the rule of law.  But that would mean that the police should be accountable for their actions and not the citizenry.

Floyd was a convicted felon. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Police Department did not investigate Floyd as the officer in the uniform. They did investigate Floyd as a suspect. Floyd was convicted on felony charges and was sentenced to 10 years of probation and a $1 million fine. The reason that Floyd was convicted on a felony is because the amount of money the FBI was charged with in Floyd's case was $1 million. The amount that Floyd was charged with was $500,000 in cash.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

I believe it would be a national embarrassment if this happened in any way other than for reasons that still have to be determined. The professional and personal integrity of the police officer who killed Floyd is under enormous scrutiny. The facts from the case against Floyd seem to show a very different picture. The fact that the FBI was able to pick and chose one of the best officers in society to fill a spot that was very critical to their success is certainly a huge moral and legal loss to the American people.

I am of the belief that the media and the Democrats have gone too far with sensationalizing the case and the Floyd killings. The fact that the official story is being used to justify the killing of Floyd and the media or Democrats media outlets that are covering the case is even more damning. The media and Democrats have gone far beyond sensationalization and sensationalizing. They have gone beyond looking at a case in the grand scheme of thing and trying to justify that. They have gone beyond looking at an officer who was killed in the line of duty and trying to justify the killing of that officer. They have gone beyond looking at a case in the legal system and trying to justify the killing of Floyd.

And I don't say that in a bad light. I do not think that the media or Democrats should have done anything to express the view of the community that Floyd was a violent thug who had committed a crime. Floyd was a very violent man who was facing trial for a very violent crime. It is not a crime for a police officer to shoot somebody just because they're black. It is a crime for a police officer to shoot someone because they're a different race.

[comment]I think that the media and Democrats are acting in a very harsh way with the Floyd case. They are sensationalizing the case in a way that is extremely inaccurate.

[comment]I'm not saying that the media needs to focus on the Floyd case. I am saying that the media should focus on the fact that there was a violent altercation between Floyd and a police officer.

*nbsp*

As a result the left has decided to go out of their way to label and label the police as we see them in the media and in the political process. The Democrats have decided to label law enforcement as a whole and the Republicans have gone out of their way to label all police as evil.

The left has decided to label the police as the enemy of the people
As we all know the left has been very intolerant of our past and we have to remember the fact that the left has been very intolerant of our past and have been very intolerant of our political opponents.

I am sure the media has been very bad with the left on this one

As a result the left has decided to go out of their way to label and label the police as evil and the right have gone out of their way to label all police as evil. The left has decided to label all police as evil and the right has decided to label all police as evil.

So I think the left and right are all very much in the same boat

Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

There are already signs that the political landscape in the United States is changing.  Trump lost the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election and the popular vote by big margins in the general election.  Democrats are winning by larger margins in the general election than they did before Trump's election and the general election in general.  Anti-Trump voters have shown no signs of turning to Democrats and thus no signs of turning to the Republican Party.  Also

Even though the Democrats are winning
It's hard to see a lot of enthusiasm for Trump in the electorate
And the scale of the electoral losses is mind boggling. 

The Democrats are in a state of deep electoral error that has not had a presidential election since the 1800s.  They have been doing this for decades.  In fact
The Democrats are going to be the party of the rich and the powerful for a long time to come.  

They need to win the popular vote or they will be a laughing stock in the eyes of the American people. 

I believe the Democrats will win the popular vote in 2020 as well.  

I think the other thing that's holding the Democrats back is the fear that the electoral votes will be lost.  

I think that the extreme dislike Trump has for Democrats has to do with the fact that he has a very big base of supporters that are united by a platform of economic competence. 

That's not to say that the Democrats are the worst party on earth. They are probably the worst party on earth. 

But I think that many of us are more likely to vote Republican than Democrat because we're all distrustful of one another. 

The point is that the Democrats have been doing this for decades.  

As a result we're certainly not going to get a democratic republic for the next 20 to 25 years. 

The problem is that there's been a real effort to distance ourselves from the right side of the political spectrum in the last few years.  

The left is getting fiscally conservative and the right is getting more liberal. 

The left is doing alright and I think the real question still is how far the left will get. 

I don't see any reason to believe that if the left were to win the Senate and the House it would go to Republicans, the Democrats would win the House. 

But that would be a very different election than the one Trump is in. 

The left is going to win the House in 2020 and the Senate in 2020. 

So far the left has basically won everything except for the House and I think that's going to change very soon. 

I don't think there's a chance that the Democrats will be successful in 2020. I think there's a chance that they can win the House of Representatives. 

But as long as there is a moderate Republican president in the next few years and I don't think that's going to happen then I don't think there's a chance that the Democrats will be successful in 2020. 

I think that Democrats have the edge on the right in 2020 because they're less extreme and don't have to go into politics to win. 

I don't think that Democrats have enough votes to win a majority in the Senate and I think that they're going to be in a pretty bad spot in the House with Republican obstructions and they're going to be in a pretty bad spot with the Democrats. 

I'm not saying that I think that the left has shown more progress than the right over the last couple of years and I think that the left has shown more progress than the right. But I think that the left has shown more progress than the right.

I think that the left has been doing more to counter the right than the right has been on issues like raising taxes. 

But I think that the left has been doing more to counter the right than the

They are the backbone of the investigation and they have a high return on investment for taxpayers.
[comment]I don't know if this is exaggerated but I think the FBI agent who killed Floyd was on the wrong side of the law. If they had a body cam of him being shot down they could have found him a few feet away. I don't think Floyd was being targeted. Floyd was being targeted because of his ethnicity. Floyd was being targeted because he was Latino. Floyd was being targeted because he was a Muslim. Floyd was being targeted because he was a Republican.

We have to do everything we can to protect the American people. I am so proud of the freedoms that we have. 

[comment]Trump’s scheme of action is going to lead to a lot of deaths and to a lot of innocent people’s deaths. The way the Democrats are trying to use this to try to punish politicians and the media that are trying to try to get them to release the names of people that they have nothing to do with is not good enough. We need a political system that is accountable to the people. 

I am very pleased that President Trump has finally come to the right and said that the American people have the right to know who the president is and that there is no credible threat of violence. This was a very difficult decision and we have to make it right. I think that lives matter and that we have to do everything we can to protect the American people. 

We have to stop the madness. We have to stop the lies and the pressure that have been put on us. 

The reality is that the American people have the right to know who the president is.

We have to take it seriously. Let the media and the media media do their job. We have to take it seriously. The test will come.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

There is a real risk that people will not do their due diligence and hold the police accountable for their actions. I am sure there are many reasons states find themselves in such a situation.

In the last 15 years there has been a major increase in arrests and the number of deaths. I think there are important reasons for this in the past few years.

At the same time there has been a lot of high profile media coverage of the situation. The media is almost entirely owned by major corporations and has a long history of covering issues. Most of the media coverage of this situation has focused on the fact that the police are not doing their job.

It is hard to imagine what this could be like if the coronavirus has not been involved in the events.

I am not aware of a single article about the case in the New York Times or CNN.

I hear there are many articles about the case in the Washington Post.

The reason why people so far are downplaying the death of Floyd is because the media has covered it up and has instead covered it up with cheap shots and spin.

I think it is prudent to remember that the story being covered up sometimes has repercussions and it is a matter of fairness in the media. I think the public should be able to voice their opinions and suffer if they feel that they are being unfairly blamed for the death of a law abiding citizen.

The federal government should not be allowed to engage in the behavior that the police have been accused of.

The only way to fix the situation is to have these state and local agencies investigate themselves and make sure that the cases are not handled by an outside entity that has the power to investigate them.

I think the police should not be allowed to be in the news for very long. There are a lot of people on the news who are being dragged into this by right wing news outlets and their biases.

This is what happens when you have a government that is inept and corrupt. It is not a place that is easy to cover up.

If people are not being held accountable and they are being wrongly accused and the media is covering it up
There are a lot of people out there that are trying to make themselves look bad and we need to be on the side of people that look bad. If you look at the political landscape in the United States right now there is a far right movement that is pushing for a national investigation with a Democratic President.

I think that the media is under the impression that the investigation is something that is going to happen and that it should be handled in the proper way.

There are people that are saying that the FBI investigation is not needed and that it should have been handled in the proper way. This is not a conservative thing to do.

The fact of the matter is that the president is not accountable for the actions of the FBI. The president is even more accountable as the head of the FBI.

If you are looking for facts the media would be better served by covering it up.

I sincerely hope that law enforcement agencies do a better job with the investigation than they have done in the past. The truth is out there.
[comment]When do people start to realize that the media is so corrupt and that the president is a corrupt nut?

The Democrats have a very clearly defined strategy for coming out of this administration. They know they can't win the popular vote and there is no way to get the popular vote back in the Republican hands.
[comment]Trump was impeached for lying about his conversations with Russia. He did not have to lie about the conversations. I think there is no way to get the president to resign.

[comment]We are in the middle of a political crisis. Can you imagine what is going to happen when all the predictions are off and the electoral college is up for grabs? It is a crisis that the federal government is facing where it has to deal with a whole bunch of different issues.
[comment]I'm not sure how they could not already be in that situation: the clock is ticking on the president being impeached for mishandling the investigation into Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden is going to be the president for awhile if he doesn't do his job.
[comment]I don't know if I’m even a Democrat anymore. I know that honestly the White House has been way more tolerant of the media than any president has been in his life
[comment]I haven't been able to get an opinion on this[comment]I don’t get it. The Left are sick and tired of these politics and this is clearly not the way to go.

It’s not the right that I’m voting for. I don't think it’s the right. And I don’t think it’s a distraction from what is really going on in the country.

What do you think?
[comment]I always thought the left have been the worst. The left are the ones that have been really bad. So bad that they have become a household word in America.
[comment]I am a Republican. I don’t believe the media is biased against me. I don’t think the Left have been making any real progress. I am a liberal and I am not a Republican. I don’t know if the media is biased or not. I am a Democrat and I don't think the media can be blamed for anything.
[comment]I agree that the media is biased against the left and I think the media should be held accountable for that.
[comment]I was confused “I don’t know if I’m even a democrat anymore”
[comment]I’m not a Democrat either. I am a Republican and I share the same political beliefs.
[comment]I am a republican and I don't think the media is biased. I don’t think the media has been corrupting the political landscape. The media have been doing the exact opposite of what they said they would be doing.
[comment]I am a republican and I'm not a Republican. I don't believe the media is biased against me. I don't believe the media should be held accountable for anything.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

Regardless of what happens in the next 5 years the mainstream media will continue to report on the cases and unless can be blamed on Trump or any other Democrat they will simply ignore the cases and ignore the issue.

It's as if the left has lost their credibility.

Remember that 16 years ago when the free press was the most powerful weapon in the hands of the government?

We have been waiting for the trump administration to release the transcripts of the interviews with the FBI and other witnesses and they are finally being released as well.

This is at the level of fiction. The media will continue to carry this for the next few years and I feel as though the American people are going to continue to suffer for a very long time.

As long as Trump is in office
The Left will continue to exaggerate the cases and ignore the evidence in the media.

It's amazing how much the media and the Democratic Party have lost their credibility in the first place.

The Left is still a power group that is completely unable to change and have completely lost their credibility.

The only people that are completely capable of doing anything are corporate owners and billionaires.

Neither are they completely incompetent.

They don't seem to be able to deal with the fact that they have lost their credibility.

They have lost their sense of reality.

The left is still an important force in American politics
And that's a big reason why the Left is still so important to the American people.

The Left has been as racist, sexist, xenophobic and hatred towards the American people as the left has been against the American people in the past. They have been as poorly trained as they have been in the recruitment and training of police officers. They have been as ineffective as they have been in the recruitment and training of judges and law enforcement officials.

The Left has been reduced to a virus that is going to spread to other nations.

The Left has been reduced to a virus that is going to spread to other nations.

(The Left is now the virus that's going to destroy the Democratic Party. It's going to destroy the Republican Party too. It's going to destroy the Democrats too).

Again and again and again and this virus is going to move to other countries.

And it's going to spread to other races.

The virus is going to spread to all the different countries and it's going to spread to all ethnic groups.

And it's going to spread all the way to Europe.

It's going to spread to the Middle East, across the board.

And it's going to spread over the whole world.

It's going to spread all over the world.

It's going to spread all over the world.

It's going to spread across Europe.

It's going to spread across the whole world.

It's going to spread everywhere.

Everyone is going to be on the same continent and everyone is going to be on a different continent and everyone is going to be on a different continent.

It's going to be a global pandemic.

Every national and ethnic group is going to be on the same continent.

It's going to be a global pandemic.

Every national and ethnic group is going to be on the same continent.

It's going to be a global pandemic.

Every national and ethnic group is going to be on the same continent.

It's going to be a global pandemic.

Every national and ethnic group is going to be on the same continent.

It's going to be a global pandemic.

Every national and ethnic group is going to be on the same continent.

It's going to be a global pandemic.

Every national and ethnic group is going to be on the same continent.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
[comment]It is not the government's business to do all the work for anybody[comment]myself and the rest of the world have been killing cops for years now. among other things[comment]what happened to George Floyd?

[comment]I'm not really sure how it can be a coincidence that Floyd was killed in a police officer's patrol car.
[comment]The riots and killings in Baltimore and Dallas are a reminder of the very real consequences of police brutality.
[comment]And the others are still here.
[comment]It's just the same old hate that has been getting all the rage since the election. Liberals and conservatives just want the government to do everything they can to keep cops from being able to beat back their own murderous psychopaths.
[comment]This is all part of the narrative. Republicans and conservatives both want to keep cops in jail while making sure that the child that has been raped isn't allowed to go to school.

I'm not saying Donald Trump isn't corrupt and I'm not saying the US has gone through a similar situation in the past few years. But the whole situation is just to explain how the left and the media have been trying to portray this as being a civil war.
[comment]This isn't a political issue. It's a human right. It's a right that was created by the Constitution to protect the citizens. To me it's a legitimate right.
[comment]It's a shame the right is so easily "divided" and "deplorables." The left has nothing to lose but its hatred and hypocrisy. I don't think there's a better group of people in the world than the Left. I'm not advocating a right to hate or anger. But I do think that the left has a responsibility to not let this become a distraction that distracts them from their mission.
[comment]I don't believe that the left has the right to be "deplorables." The left is the enemy. But it's not the enemy.

I don't think the Left has the right to be "deplorables"
[comment]I'm sorry but this isn't a political issue.
[comment]We've been through a shit war with the left for the last decade they've been fighting each other ever since the DNC and then some. They've been constantly dividing the country.
[comment]The right has to be "deplorables"
[comment]We need to look at the real issue and ask ourselves: where is the left in this?
[comment]I ask:

1) Is the left any better than the right?

2) They have to face the fact that we have to take action and fight them
[comment]For once they can be trusted to say the same thing to us.
[comment]I'm not sure they're "deplorables" in the first place
[comment]I'm tired of people saying "we don't need a left" and "we don't need a right". That's not saying I support the left but I do think the left should be better than the right.
[comment]I'm tired of people saying "we don't need a left" and "we don't need a right" and just saying "we don't need a left."

I'm not sure they are "deplorables" in the first place
[comment]A non-partisan website that I know of that includes a lot of sources. Does anyone know more?
[comment]I think we can all agree that the left needs to get out of the media
[comment]I'm not sure that the left has the right to be "deplorables"

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

[comment]For a while now I've thought about what will happen if Trump becomes president and picks a candidate. If he does that will be a very big change. I think the issue for the Democrats is that they already have a very strong political base at this point. They already have a strong leader in the White House. It's a very different situation than the Bernie Sanders insurgency that I think they are going to need to get a handle on.
[comment]8 more years of Trump
[comment]Here's the thing: if Trump is elected (and I am not saying that he will be) we will have a new political system that will be much more democratic than the one that the Democrats had in place. The political system is very milquetoast
[comment]We can't be apathetic to this anymore. We need to rally around people who will take responsibility and make a difference for our country.
[comment]We need to elect people who will stand up for people's rights while actually fighting against the evil of big corporations. It will be a disaster for our country.
[comment]I think it's safe to say that the left hates Trump more than the right.
[comment]I'm not sure what to think about it. Trump is a dictator. He's overreaching and he's out to destroy our country. But the left hates them. They are the most hated enemy of the American people. They despise the people because they are the ones who live in the shadow of the ruling class. They are the ones who have seen their freedoms frozen and have no ability to govern.
[comment]It's a shame that it took so long for Trump to be elected. People don't have to defend the president anymore.
[comment]Trump is a dictator. He's overreaching and he's out to destroy our country.
[comment]Trump is a dictator and he is out to destroy our country.
[comment]As a Democrat[comment]I’m not sure if I have a right to be mad or not[comment]We have seen the end of the Trump era. The division between the parties has subsided. It’s a different era than the one we had at the beginning of the republic when Democrats and Republicans used to be united and a unified Democratic party.
[comment]The more you look at the left[comment]I've been saying for a while that the left isn't unique to America. The left is a group that is unified and unified. They are not an organization that is any longer.
[comment]I'm a big fan of Trump. He has been an enabler to the left for a while. He has been a strong supporter of the Democrats and of Bernie Sanders and of course the Democrats.

As a citizen of the United States I think Trump is a really bad president. He has had a bad year in office and I think he's been a bad president for a while.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I don't really know what to think about this. It’s amazing how many leftwing supporters are in the Democratic Party.
[comment]At this point I really don’t understand how people can just blindly accept a position of authority. How can people accept a man who has committed crimes and is a criminal?

I don’t think this is a partisan thing. The left isn’t a party. I am a Democrat and I don't think that anyone in the Democratic Party is a Democrat. 

I don’t know how they can accept a man who is a criminal without also accepting the fact that he’s a Democrat.
[comment]Well if I am a Republican I don’t really care about who is Trump politically. I don’t care for his policies and the fact that he's been a criminal for the past 8 years. I don't care about how he’s been treated or how he’

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

[comment]Hey bud!
[comment]Just because a law enforcement officer dies doesn't mean that the officer was not involved in the death.
[comment]All you need to know is that the behaviour of any law enforcement officer is the result of the individual's actions[comment]I can't wait for the day when every one of us have a Black Law enforcement officer[comment]Why is the right to be afraid of communism so important? The left will be silent.
[comment]I'd like to see black Americans get the ball rolling on how the police are being investigated and how the government is protecting our community.
[comment]I don't know what the motivation is. I think there has to be some kind of 'political agenda' to justify this.
[comment]I think a lot of this is probably because we don't have enough officers.
[comment]The problem is that we have this
[comment]I can't wait for the day when black Americans have the ball and we can all do what we want.
[comment]I think a lot of this is probably because we're not able to find a team to investigate all the cases and we have a pattern of police hitting black people.
[comment]I’m not surprised that the left is taking this seriously.
[comment]I have a friend who is a police officer and he has been in the military for 15 years. He was in the police force for almost 20 years. He was killed in a police shootout and the fact that he is a civilian officer who has a civilian job and a civilian job pays for the job.
[comment]I think that BLM has a different agenda than the police.
[comment]Lmao
[comment]I love how the people in the left are cheering for the cops and in the right cheering for the republicans and all of that.
[comment]I’m sure the media will report that the case against Trump is over.

[title]Trump Tower Gets A Massive Blow Over The Ukraine Accuser
[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/media/2020-03-25/trump-trumps-trumps-trumps-dallas-blunder-trumps-dallas-cfl-pip-up/[comment]“alleged Ukraine agent”?”
[comment]I bet that's how he got the documents in Ukraine.
[comment]The Ukraine agent was a PDK member
[comment]It’s so important that the US comply with the resolution that the Ukraine government has signed. “We have to stop sending our troops to Turkey” and “Russia is sending us all the warplanes and tanks. “They’ve given us everything and now it is time to start sending our troops and equipment to Ukraine.”
[comment]I am trying to be a Republican here. I don't believe the left is obsessed with the conflict and Ukraine is a big place to vote. I’ve no political leanings and I have no xenophobic views.
[comment]The Ukraine agent was a member of the PDK and had a long career in the military. He was accused of having illegal dealings in Ukraine. He was then indicted for having illegal dealings. He was acquitted in five months.
[comment]He’s a dead man walking
[comment]He’s a dead man.
[comment]I wonder how many of us in the media will talk about this.
[comment]I am very surprised that the media has so much interest in this.
[comment]I buy it
[comment]I am sure that the left hates Trump so much that they will never have any interest in anyone.
