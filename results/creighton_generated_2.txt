Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]It's a shame that we're starting to see the very comments that we need to remedy. "We need to get rid of Coronavirus. We need to get rid of the coronavirus. We need to get the coronavirus out of our system. We need to get rid of that virus out of public hands."
       
[comment]Why is so much of this being said in all of these developments?
[comment]A lot of this is simply a way for the media and their allies to discredit the Democrats and the Republicans.

Republicans are the real problem and they're coming out and saying that the ACA is a failure. What they need to do is to smear the Democratic nominee and smear the GOP nominee. It's a basket case[comment]How can anyone not to be distrustful of this? It's just an exercise in being too trusting.
[comment]Can I just say that I am absolutely NOT a Trump supporter. I have no problem with Trump's policies and have no problem with his economic policies as far as I'm concerned. I feel like I have no problem with him whatsoever.
[comment]Can you imagine how many pro-life Democrats would be so totally appalled if a man who's been in the hospital for a couple of weeks and is in a hospital with a baby had a heart attack?
[comment]Anti-life Democrats
[comment]This is how the Democratic Party operates.
[comment]When you interrupt the proceedings to interrupt the news and the government.
[comment]Damn.
[comment]If we're going to fight the virus we must end the coronavirus.
[comment]I can't believe I'm talking about this. I feel like I'm being caught asking for Bernie supporters to fuck off.  It's so dumb.
[comment]The only Democratic Party that actually cares about this is the Democratic Party of America.

[title]Trump’s tax breaks to wind up in Las Vegas are a sham
[selftext]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzZ2Xd2ifNk
[comment]There's nothing funny about trump pulling the strings at one of the largest tax break in the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOZ3-9_9IwA
[comment]I just can’t believe how much money the GOP is spending on the coronavirus
[comment]The media should be ashamed of themselves for not being more transparent in their dealings with the media.
[comment]Trump is a sham.
[comment]Trump can’t pay his taxes.
[comment]So a tax break to wind up in the Vegas resort is a sham?
[comment]He's making big bucks off this rich little man.
[comment]He's a hypocrite.
[comment]Trump has taken credit for his tax breaks for years. Factually[comment]He's not paying his taxes.
[comment]Is anyone else feeling the Bern?
[comment]No.
[comment]He’s a "puppet" of Trump.
[comment]He's a fraud.
[comment]I still don't understand how this could be a big deal.
[comment]The pirate on the other side can't get his money's worth.
[comment]The only difference is that the Fox News team has been saying that Trump's tax returns aren't included in the tax returns.

Kentucky
[comment]We must get this out there.
[comment]I've heard that Kentucky is being investigated for a virus.
[comment]It's a virus.
[comment]The CDC has ranked Kentucky as one of the worst states in the country in terms of coronavirus.
[comment]They have a duty to act. The CDC is trying to get the virus from Kentucky.
[comment]There's a difference between being a virus victim and being in the CDC right now.

It's not about whether or not you know you are a virus victim. It's about how you treat people with them.

The CDC has ranked Kentucky as one of the worst states in the country in terms of coronavirus.


Kentucky has a duty to act.
[comment]I got the feeling that the CDC has a lot of baggage.  I live in a state that has been going through a complete re-establishment.  I'm not sure I agree with the CDC on everything.
[comment]Somebody should be taking a walk in the woods and letting the virus from Kentucky spread.

Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]What a depressing time. I'd love for him to be a senator[comment]Why is this the case? 

The economy is under attack and the globalists of the right are just as bad.  The Democratic Party should be making sure they have a hard time getting their way in order to stay in power.
[comment]Sounds like the real reason why Coronavirus was a bigger deal.

I'd love to see more of Coronavirus[comment]I would love to see the United States take a more active role in caring for the sick and dying. 

The virus is a virus and it's a virus.  If you suspect something's wrong or are suffering from a virus you need to contact your health care provider.

You can't get a fake flu shot or medication in a hospital.  But one must be given.  If someone has the virus you cannot get any help at all.

[comment]Fear is a false and destructive manifestation of despair
[comment]What is this about?    
[comment]The human race is experiencing a drastic increase in the number of cases of coronavirus. This is why it's so important to keep people out of the hospital[comment]I always feel like it is a hoax to suggest there is some widespread misinformation or misinformation spread by the media.  If it were true it would be hilarious.  

The problem is that it still isn't. 

If you have a crisis you need to expect to be there for a while.  

As a general rule of thumb[comment]I'm sorry but I have a hard time believing it anyone would believe that the media would be so supportive of the idea that it is a hoax.  

Like I said the fever is real.  

The virus is not a hoax.  

The first thing that happens is that the virus rises and sets off a chain reaction.  

Then it gets spread to other countries and then the virus is re-entered and another virus is set to spread.  

Then it gets spread to multiple people and then it gets spread to another person or people.  

Then
and the virus goes back to the original source and then it goes back to the source again. 

Then it goes back to the source again and then it goes back to the source again.  

Then
and the virus goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.  

Then it goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.   
The virus goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.  

Then it goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.  
Then it goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.   
Then
and then it goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.   
Then it goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.  

Then it goes back to the original source again and then it goes back to the source again.  
Then it goes back to the source again and then it goes back to the source again.  
And then it goes back to the source again.  
And then it goes back to the source again and then it goes back to the source again.  

Lastly
I don't even get the word "crisis" in that sentence.  

I feel like it's an attempt to make me feel less like I'm being blamed for something and more of an actuality.

I feel like this is a common denominator with all the media and politicians. 

I feel like the whole point of it is to make me feel like I'm the one who is being blamed for something and not the other way around.

I feel like the goal of the media and politicians is to make people feel like they're all part of something. 

I feel like the only way to deal with this is to make people feel like they're all part of something. 

I feel like the only way to deal with this is to make people feel like they're all part of something.

He should be impeached. 

He should be stripped of his title of King of The World. 

He should be investigated and investigated and investigated.
[comment]The only way to keep his base from actually believing that he's a moron is to convict him of a crime and then re-trial him.

[title]Joe Biden: Republicans are "Doofus[selftext]https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-gop-gop-democrats-doofus-firing-him-its-complicated-but-far-more-than-20048494[comment]He’s an idiot.
[comment]If we want real change[comment]This is a serious issue and I don’t think we’re going to get it through the Senate. We have to re-elect Trump and make sure he becomes president.
[comment]Yeah Biden. I don’t think we can get it through the senate.
[comment]It’s a long shot. We need to build a wall and kill all the Mexicans in the US.
[comment]Biden is now the presumptive nominee. He has the most votes in the senate and the most delegates. If we can't pass anything before he is the nominee[comment]Thank you Joe Biden for the democratic vote.
[comment]You should vote for Biden over Trump in 2020.
[comment]I'm not an "intellectual". I'm a Republican. So is the president.
[comment]I don't like Trump
[comment]The problem is the GOP are a bunch of idiots. If we can't get through the senate by 2020 with the help of our own party[comment]Biden's response is to "Pathetically" admit it can’t happen.
[comment]The Republican Party have a moral obligation to ensure the party nominee is a good one.
[comment]Biden's response is to re-vote the way that he did and re-run the primary.
[comment]He's a hero.
[comment]Biden is a hero.
[comment]He's a hero.
[comment]I'm not an "intellectual". I'm a Republican.
[comment]This is a thoroughly stupid and unfair question.
[comment]I think it's safe to say that most people don't care about the substance of what Biden says.
[comment]He's some kind of a joke and not a hero.
[comment]I don't think we're getting it.
[comment]I actually think we should vote for Biden.
[comment]I think we should vote for Biden.
[comment]The problem with Biden is that he is so self-centered. He's so late to the party. He should be the nominee.
[comment]What he is trying to do is make it so that there is no point in talking about the substance of the issue. He is making it so that there are no points in talking about the substance of this. He is making it so that there is no point in talking about the substance of this.
[comment]Oh[comment]I have no idea what Biden is planning on doing with this.
[comment]It's not a surprise that Biden is a shitty person.
[comment]I actually think this is a good thing. The Democrats are the most reliable party in the primary because they are so proud of what they are doing that the GOP have a better chance of defeating the Democrats in November.
[comment]This is a serious issue and I don't think we can get it through the Senate.
[comment]I don't think Trump is a hero.
[comment]I don't think Trump is a hero either.
[comment]I don't think Biden has a chance to win.

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]It's really important to remember that Coronavirus isn't a virus. It's a natural or widespread infection. The more people that are exposed to it, the more likely these viruses are to spread.
[comment]You're welcome.
[comment]I totally agree with this. It's not a pandemic. It's the result of the governments inaction.

We can't afford to live in a world in which the CDC is the only source of information and information is a fact that everyone has to participate in.
[comment]This is really fucking sick.
[comment]I'm so sorry to see this. It's a shame that we have to deal with it.
[comment]I really hope they are more careful.
[comment]The irony of all this is the fact that Coronavirus is an absolutely non-issue. The CDC is not. And it's not just us. The CDC has been massively negligent with regards to the outbreak.
[comment]Coronavirus is a global pandemic.

* * *

[1] Coronavirus is a global pandemic
[comment]This isn't a question of the CDC.  This is a question of whether it really is the CDC.
[comment]I'd be surprised if there are any[comment]I don't have any shit. The CDC should have been more careful with Coronavirus. 

The only pandemic they've done so far have been in China[comment]I'm sure that's not a surprise[comment]Heh.
[comment]I'm confused. Coronavirus is not a virus. It's a natural state of the environment. 

So this virus is the result of a disaster.
[comment]So [comment]If I were in a world in which the CDC is the only source of information
[comment]The CDC should be more careful with coronavirus.
[comment]I have a feeling that the CDC is not going to be the same if these coronavirus outbreaks start to spread. They just won't be able to keep up with these pandemics.
[comment]So this is why we have a president who is clearly not educated on the virus
[comment]I don't think that's a surprise.
[comment]* * *
[comment]I'm a Liberal Democrat and I want to pretend that I don't live in a bubble. I hope I don't have to tell the truth.
[comment]I don't even know who this guy is.

[comment]Oh[selftext]Let's go in the right direction[comment]I love this.    

I like the idea that people who voted for Trump[comment]As they say in the bible
The virus can be stopped.
[comment]It won't.    
It won't.   

Bless them.
[comment]The right is so stupid.

[comment]Cowards.
[comment]Get out of my way[comment]I don't like this. 

I think it's fair to say that this is a response to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union and the sight of the President of the European Parliament (and the EU phone number and email) being forced to answer questions about the EU's handling of the crisis.

I think that’s what President Trump is going to do.
[comment]Does anyone see the irony here?
[comment]This is getting a fair amount of attention.
[comment]The right is so stupid. They were the ones who were in the wrong with the Iraq War.
[comment]I'm not a Trump supporter but I can't wait to see what the GOP has to say about this.
[comment]I think the right is so complete that they can’t even remember the last time they were in the wrong.
[comment]And their supporters are so stupid.

[comment]What the hell was the title of this post? 

I'm offering this as a response to the recent spread of a virus that has been spreading in the United States.  
[comment]This article is insane.   

The only thing that is bringing this news is the fact that it's coming from a man who is very prominent in the Republican Party.
[comment]I'm glad you guys are all with me!
[comment]I hope this is the beginning of a new beginning.  

It's important to remember that this virus is currently being spread by the attack of November 6.  

This is a virus that will eventually die out and will be spread mostly by people who haven't tried. 

The only way they can stop the spread of this virus in the first place is if they keep the population on its toes[comment]If only there was a much better way.
[comment]It's kind of funny that this shit is so contagious.
[comment]This is not an isolated case.  Its spread is being spread.
[comment]This presumes that the Republican Party is the Republican party.
[comment]I'm really sorry that I have to go into this in the most conspiratorial way.
[comment]I feel so bad for those of us who really appreciate the party of Lincoln.

I feel like we need to start talking about coronavirus right now. 

The party of Lincoln.
[comment]This is going to get worse.
[comment]It's going to get worse.
[comment]Someone needs to be removed from office.
[comment]I have to say that[comment]This is just another example of the GOP trying to make an issue out of the other side.
[comment]This is just another example of the GOP trying to make an issue out of the other side.
[comment]I feel like the party is going to go away. 

We need to start giving the party a free pass so we don't have to go back to the ways of the past.
[comment]It's just a general election now and I'm sure all of you will vote for whoever you support.
[comment]Sorry but the GOP is the party of Lincoln.
[comment]I'm sad to say that this is coming to a head.

I'm really sorry but they haven't acted like it.
[comment]This is just another example of the GOP going to the party of Lincoln.
[comment]I wonder if it's going to be picked up by the Democratic Party and then the GOP would be able to get away with their usual "we can't do this we have to go with the party of Lincoln" rhetoric.
[comment]The Republican Party is now the party of Lincoln.
[comment]This is just another example of the GOP trying to make an issue out of the other side.
[comment]I saw the headline and thought it was going to be a lot worse.
[comment]It's not the virus itself that is the problem. It's the way that the Republican Party chooses to frame things.
[comment]This is just another example of the GOP trying to make an issue out of the other side.
[comment]Wow[comment]The GOP has always been the party of Lincoln.
[comment]It's just another example of the GOP going to the party of Lincoln.

[comment]This is why you should be so worried.
[comment]I can see it happening.  I don't know if it'll be a new thing[comment]I was worried.
[comment]The whole Coronavirus thing is garbage.  The only reason it’s going forward is “it”s part of the economic recovery.                       |              |

But that's just the way it is.
[comment]I will always be of the opinion that if you're a conservative[comment]I'm not sure I agree with his statement. It's not just the fact that he's a Republican. There are a lot of conservatives who are still Republicans.
[comment]I feel like he's the baddest fucking Republican bastard alive.
[comment]He has been on the cover of Time for years now
[comment]&gt; Coronavirus is an apocalyptic virus that will devastate the US for years.
[comment]The biggest news story of the year took place on an evening news program on Fox News.  The virus didn't run any more[comment]If you can't keep the virus out of the Earth's atmosphere[comment]It's just too big.
[comment]I have concerns about his non-demands.   These are all things I can't manage.
[comment]The Republican Party is broken. 

You can't keep them.
[comment]It's disgusting.
[comment]This is why I keep trying to get my kids out of the hospital.
[comment]I'm not an expert on this; I know everything I have to say[comment]I also need to be careful about how I handle mails.
[comment]It’s not like he's going to give up on trump.
[comment]The only thing that's going to change is his tax returns.
[comment]If you don't want any kind of republic[comment]No one accuses him of doing nothing.
[comment]Maybe he should have paid more tax in 2016[comment]These are the same people who think that the only way to prevent the spread of a pandemic is to bail out Wall Street
[comment]He has to be impeached.
[comment]It’s a good thing the GOP is falling apart.
[comment]This is what has happened to the GOP.

[comment]I would assume he has no plans to leave the party
[comment]I'd go as far as to say he's a racist and a homophobic.
[comment]I've been using the same old words and phrases
[comment]I think to some extent he's a racist.
[comment]I also worry that he's a pathological liar[comment]This is just so bad.
[comment]The only people that are allowed to leave him alone are the Republicans. If only we could give them a chance to vote out the GOP.
[comment]You know what happened to this president? His tax returns.
[comment]I think he needs to be convicted and jailed.

[comment]I’m always quite proud of the right-wing nut job that is Donald J. Trump. As a former conservative Republican I really don’t understand why.
[comment]Biden is running. He's going to win Ohio and he’s going to win Wisconsin.
[comment]Any chance we can get Biden up and running in 2016?
[comment]I can't seem to get past the fact that Biden is a vicious and vile fraud that deserves to be in prison for life.
[comment]I was so excited when the presidential campaign was over. I haven’t gotten to see Biden for some time. I’m still a bit surprised. I’d like to think he’ll get the nomination but I’m pretty sure that’s a long way from my expectations
[comment]Trump isn't a bad guy.  He just needs to get his act together.
[comment]I mean[comment]I think he's going to be defeated by a very easy way: he's going to go after the FBI because they need a new president.  This is why they went after Mueller.
[comment]I’m going to vote for Biden[comment]I would hope that he’s already out of office.  He’s going to be a popular choice for president.
[comment]It's also unfortunate but a good thing because this is going to be a very dangerous time. The GOP has no place in the November election and so if you can't win[comment]I’m going to vote for Biden.
[comment]I just bought a ticket to see the man who was the president of the United States.
[comment]He's going to have to win Florida and Arizona.
[comment]If I were in his shoes
I'd vote for Biden.
[comment]I’m not a fan of Biden.  I don’t think he’s a conservative at all[comment]I'm a Bernie supporter and I saw this coming.
[comment]I don't know if I like it or not but I’d love to see what the "national coalition" of democrats[comment]Good.  Biden won't have the kind of ratings or the numbers to win the general if it’s not the Democratic nominee.
[comment]He's in a real fight with a real fight.
[comment]Good.

Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]This is a blatant attempt to make it look like we are going to get a better deal for everyone if we just shut the fuck up.
[comment]I’m not a fan of the "to the sharp" line but the standardization of reality is fine.
[comment]Why is it that we have a republic[comment]Well
I think the whole "coronavirus" thing is a bigoted rant from the leaders of the right and left.
[comment]Ironic that you can't just shut the fuck up and let people go.
[comment]I think republicans are going to figure this out soon.
[comment]I think the republicans are going to find an effective way to move forward and keep the country from getting worse.
[comment]Clintons are trying to find a way to keep the republicans on the right while the right tries to keep the democrats on the left.
[comment]I think this is just a ploy to get us to vote out a bunch of people who are otherwise part of the republicans.
[comment]That’s all they are.
[comment]No one can tell the difference between a "moderate" and a "liberal".  

I think they're all in the same camp. 

This is just one more example of people trying to put their personal lives in danger to get what they want.
[comment]I don't think we have to be so picky. The whole GOP is basically just a bunch of boomer<|startoftext|>
[title]Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday defended the Republican Party's moves to cut off funding to abortion clinics in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act.

[comment]I hope they don't use the Supreme Court as an excuse to pull the plug on this.
[comment]I hope it’s not the right way to do it.
[comment]The GOP is just doing it to themselves.
[comment]You know what I mean? If they can't even figure out how to get the courts to play their cards they can’t figure out how to defund Planned Parenthood.

This is just plain wrong.

I know this is a bit unfair but it’s what we are without.
[comment]I just hope they don't pull the plug on this.
[comment]Oh yes[comment]The GOP is a bunch of wannabe cowards.

The only reason they are doing what they are doing is to get their heads under their asses.
[comment]The Republicans are the worst.  The only reason they are doing what they are doing is to get their heads under their asses.

I hope they don't pull the plug on this.
[comment]I think I can agree with Greta.
[comment]I hope this all ends badly for them.
[comment]Greta couldn't even see a way to defund anovirus without defunding the Republicans.

I don't think this is a good thing.
[comment]I hope this no longer happens.
[comment]My biggest concern is that the GOP will continue to push this through with a new tax on abortion providers.
[comment]Greta’s a good woman but it is a shame that Greta has to defend the GOP's actions

[comment]It would be a shame if we stopped to think about it that way. There's no one who can go out and challenge this.  People get on the internet and tell everyone to shut the fuck up.  Everybody has a point and everyone needs to be held accountable for their actions. 

The only thing they can do is move to the next state.  They can't go to California or Arizona.  If they go to Arizona it would be a three day protest.   If they go to Michigan or Wisconsin they might be arrested.
[comment]I've been wondering about this for a while.  Are there any good alternatives?
[comment]This is the number one reason why it's not being reopening.  I mean[comment]This is a lie.
[comment]This is a hoax. They are going to keep saying this because it is a hoax and they want to keep pushing it.
[comment]I can't believe what they're saying.  They were trying desperately to get this reopened.  I'm glad they were unsuccessful.

[comment]This is just another pringless attempt to distract attention from their pandemic.
[comment]This will probably get reopened[comment]What a fucking joke.

The real reason the story is not getting reopened is because the people who want the virus reopened have a vested interest in locking down the country and destroying it.

So[comment]This is why the president and the House of Representatives should pass a law to require the CDC to submit all new virus infections to the state-run CDC. This will be implemented immediately and should include new testing for the virus.
[comment]I'm pretty sure they're going to be on the defensive[comment]Sounds like a scammer trying to outdo a boss.

[comment]They should have volunteered to raise the alarm for Coronavirus before the real news of it has been spread. 

They should have known better.
[comment]The worst part is that the Democrats have spent the last three years forcing themselves to act in a way that is not just in the public interest but also in the party's favor. We won't be able to do this without the Democratic Party and their bullshit.
[comment]Kinda surprising.
[comment]I've seen a lot of Democrats tweet[comment]This is the worst thing in the world.
[comment]We're going to have to re-take the GOP's party from them.
[comment]Really?
[comment]I thought we were just going to be in a state of disarray and disenfranchisement and all of a sudden we're basically just out of power and the people who voted for us are on the verge of being disenfranchised.
[comment]Let's keep it that way!
[comment]The Democrats have been doing this for 3 decades and they have decided to turn it into a reality. They want to use the latest scare tactics and misinformation to create a nightmare for everyone involved.
[comment]And the truth will come out.
[comment]I'm really sorry that I have to keep saying this about the Republicans. It is the party of Lincoln.
[comment]Till last year[comment]Wow!
[comment]I've been wanting to check this out for a while now but I've finally got the courage to go and look at this and say i don't think it's a big deal.
[comment]It’s a good thing they’re not letting you remove the Republicans from office.
[comment]Well[comment]The Democrats are going to have to do this again. We’re in deep shit now[comment]I hope so. I hope so too.
[comment]I feel like the way the party handled this last time was that they thought they were going to get the worst of it[comment]I don't think it's a big deal.
[comment]I guess we're all screwed.
[comment]And now the Republicans are in power.
[comment]The democrats are going to keep doing this.
[comment]The fact that they decided to do it means that they are going to continue to do this.
[comment]It's a good thing they didn't attack Coronavirus in the first place.
[comment]I think the only thing that's going to change is how they're going to respond to the news about it. If they're going to take the party out of the party[comment]You can call this bullshit.

[title]Bernie Sanders Up For Election After An Obvious Loss
[selftext]https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden_sanders_up_for_election_after_an_obvious_loss/[comment]Hey
Bernie is safe
The only thing that could make him any less viable is if he loses
Bernie should go to the polls[comment]Bernie is doing what he's supposed to do
[comment]Bernie is making a lot of noise about how he’ll keep the DNC from making any financial contributions. How much?
====================
    [title]
Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]What a shame.

I'm not a medical expert.

But I can say with certainty that we should not be so damn stupid and irresponsible.

[comment]This is why we need more Republican Senators to pass the ACA repeal bill. 

The Democrats are in a terrible position.
[comment]Yes it's a big deal. We need to start thinking more intently about what we're going to do with the money in the bill. 

We need to start preparing for the ACA repeal. 

We need to start thinking about what we're going to do with the money in the bill.
[comment]“I’m not saying it’s going to be a disaster. But we need to start thinking about what we're going to do with the money in the bill.
[comment]This is what happened to the ACA. 

The ACA is being dismantled. 

The Republicans can’t keep it. 

Republicans are all over the place fighting to have the bill passed. 

This will get worse. 

Republicans have no idea what they have done.
[comment]Not only will this result in a massive amount of money wasted on the ACA[comment]The Democrats are better served by looking at things from a different perspective.
[comment]What a shame.
[comment]Agree with the OP in that I don't think the ACA has any impact on low income people.  We've already seen this in the ACA.
[comment]Imagine if the ACA is in danger.  Then we shouldn't be so parrot[comment]I remember when we had the ACA.
[comment]Republicans are just as stupid as the Russian trolls.
[comment]Yes it's a big deal.
[comment]The GOP is the worst.

They are trying to fuck this up so they can keep passing it.

[comment]Not going to happen
[comment]Maybe the best way to sell this is to say that it is being used to appeal to the voting public. Maybe.
[comment]It's not going to happen.
[comment]I think it should be noted that this is just a campaign ad[comment]The biggest problem with Sanders' record on this is that this is essentially a paid advertisement. In order to get the ads to appear on TV stations and on the news networks[comment]This will be the largest financial contribution to any candidate[comment]

[comment]I don't think the president has been able to stop this from happening. Republish this article as he speaks.    

[comment]Why are people so fucking angry?
[comment]I'm hoping it all ends badly for the Democratic Party.
[comment]Oh[comment]I don't know why people are so fucking angry.  I've lived in the South for the last four years and it's literally getting worse every day.  It's just harder for the GOP to make the case that the economy has been going up for too long.  They feel like they can do nothing about it if it doesn't get better.  I have heard the same argument from Bernie. 

Nah.

I'll keep my fingers crossed that this doesn't get worse.
[comment]There is a shitload of people who think this is a good idea to rally behind a bill that would have required all coronaviruses tests to be performed in the first place.  Then there are people who think this bill is a disaster.  

They are absolutely right.  They have a point.
[comment]I don't think he will pass the senate. He will have to prove he is not indicted.  And there is a chance that the Senate will convict him. 

But[comment]I think the only way he can get re-elected is if he can't win the senate.  He's not going to have the Senate to do that.  The primary will go to the governor. 

If he loses
The only reason he's so fucked up and a complete failure is that the Democratic Party has been so fucking stupid. 

It's what they are.  They have the majority for it.  They just can't deal with it. 

The reason why this is so hard to do is because the electoral college is not so much a voting bloc as it is a voting bloc system. 

The Democratic Party is obsessed with the electoral college and they have no interest whatsoever in pursuing re-election.  If the Democratic Party is going to win the electoral college in 2016[comment]I think the best way to show the difference between this and the 2016 election is to appeal to the universal base. 

If you don't have people to appeal to the general population[comment]I'm glad he wants to get rid of health care[comment]I don't think that it's a good idea to have a filibuster of any legislation.  It's the argument that the government should not be in the way. 

You could have a bill and it's fine but it's not going to have the effect of stopping the government from doing anything.  

You could have a bill and you're going to get a lot of people who are very anti-government. 

You could have a bill and you're going to get a lot of people who are very pro-government.  If you have these two bills
It's not going to stop the government from doing anything.

[comment]It's all about fake news
[comment]How many people are saying "I’m wrong!"
[comment]Vote or Die
[comment]Does this guy have a brain?
[comment]There are a lot of people who do have one[comment]I'd vote for Bernie.
[comment]Can’t wait!
[comment]Maybe we need to change the campaign slogan?
[comment]Yes[comment]Literally
[comment]Bernie is the only one that can actually win.
[comment]The only reason I vote Bernie is because I want to see the real candidates.
[comment]I’m not sure how to respond to the fact that a lot of people are confused.
[comment]If anyone else has any issues with this[comment]Hillary Clinton is far worse than Bernie.
[comment]I want to be a democrat. I want to vote.
[comment]Bernie's going to lose.
[comment]Boomers will not be the only ones.
[comment]It's important to note that this is a question of who's platform is more effective.
[comment]Maybe the left will get their wish.

Bernie's platform is more about wealth and opportunity for all.
[comment]There is a lot of misinformation out there and people who are not familiar with it are just stupid.
[comment]Why are people voting for Bernie over Bernie?
[comment]Even if we understand what really happened in both primary states[comment]The right-wing media is so obsessed with Bernie that they are so desperate to smear him as a real candidate that they're willing to give up.
[comment]I’m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. 

Bernie has done great work and the Democratic Party has immense talent.   But I really don't see any of that in the Sanders campaign.
[comment]See you in November!
[comment]I think Bernie should win the Democratic nomination and put all of his eggs in the Warren and Sanders basket.
[comment]The party needs to change its platform so that it's more focused on truth than politics.
[comment]Bernie was my first choice for VP.
[comment]This is the first time I have ever watched a Bernie rally that didn't go as well as expected.
[comment]Bernie is the only candidate that I'm thinking of that has the chance to actually win the nomination.
[comment]I really hope they won't go down that road.
[comment]I'm not sure how it is possible for Clinton to win the nomination.  If she does that[comment]Maybe I'm biased.
[comment]Oh ok I'm not sure if it's true or not.
[comment]I have one strong feeling that they are.
[comment]I think I'm more likely to vote for Biden than Sanders because he's more progressive. I'm also a Bernie supporter and I mostly support Warren.

I think it's safe to say that I'm more likely to vote

[comment]This is why we should stop defending and even criticizing the elected officials of the highest levels.
[comment]If the president and the party leaders realized that we were leading a civil war they would have stopped it.
[comment]I have no doubt that the same people who are responsible for the crisis did everything in their power to sabotage the ACA and allow it to die.

But the ACA was built upon a failed and fragile political system. In the Senate it was left up to the states to pass their own version. In the House it was left up to the president to veto it.
[comment]As a conservative[comment]The GOP are always lying and trying to control the narrative for fear of hurting the poor and black people. 

They can't even defend their actions because Republicans are so contemptuous of reality.
[comment]I think that if anyone is consistently wrong[comment]He didn't call it quits. He destroyed it.
[comment]Is this how he went from being President to president? 

You don't call a disaster a disaster when it happens?
[comment]I don't think it's not normal for a president to be a "man of the people".
[comment]I hope it's a little more obvious now. Even if he did call it quits[comment]I'm not sure if this is what he wanted but he really has to go. 

Maybe it's time to look at the entire Republican caucus as a "mob" and talk about the way their own staff felt about the president[comment]You don't interrupt the president. You interrupt the president.
[comment]He's a complete douche. He bashes the messenger. He's a complete douche.
[comment]He's a douche. Who can blame him?
[comment]He did the right thing and he's a complete douche.
[comment]He said he was going to stop the president[comment]I don't know a single one of the Republican leaders even knows that he's saying the right thing.

Do you still believe it?
[comment]He's not a democrat. Not at all.
[comment]I'm sure he regrets the mistake
[comment]As a conservative[comment]I feel like the person who is saying this is a mistake is Trump himself.
[comment]I think it's a good idea to attack the president in a different way.
[comment]It's difficult for me to see how anyone can actually know whether or not the president actually was right or wrong.
[comment]I'll agree: he is a complete douche
[comment]I have a feeling this isn't the last time he'll do that.
[comment]I don't know how he would react to the GOP's sad sack of a leader or the fact that he's an absolute douche.
[comment]I think it's funny that no one has the balls to put him in office[comment]I have to say
His last term was absolutely horrible. I think he should have been held to a higher standard.
[comment]I think the President is a complete douche.
[comment]I think he's too busy trying to kill the ACA and try to get re-elected to do it at all.
[comment]I'd kill for the president to be the most conservative one in existence.
[comment]I really can't even imagine what a president would do.

[comment]This is why it's so important to stay out of the news. As one of the most accurate and accurate news sources in the country.
[comment]Republicans are no good at finding anything interesting.
[comment]I wish they had more of a political perspective. There's always always a good chance these protests will end up in the courts.
[comment]It's true[comment]As a constitutional scholar[comment]The party that's the enemy of the people.
[comment]This is why we need to elect a president who will respect the Constitution and the law and respect the rule of law.
[comment]Why? 

The primary goal of the new administration is to revive the economy and help former President George W Bush recover.  

Democrats have been trying to make it look like Obama didn't have a chance to recover.  

He's not even in the race and he's still in the general. 

The only thing that matters is that he loses and the markets go back up. 

We need a president who will speak for the country and uphold the Constitution.  

I think we need to elect a new commander in chief.
[comment]Not a good look. 

He's in the race and the economy is going to go back up. 

I wonder how he'll do it. 

Trump has a lot of work to do to get through the year. 

I also wonder how he'll handle the economy. 

As a tax rate guy[comment]It's a really good look.  

All the things that happened this year were so bad and it's really not good for the country. 

The problem is that we've been doing this for 30 years. 

We've been doing this for over two decades. 

The problem is that most people don't know this. 

Republicans have been making it seem like they're OK with it.

The president can't have a free press and can't do anything with it. 

I don't think there is a single Democrat in the best interest of the country. 

[comment]I'm not sure what he is trying to do. 

Crimes against the United States are the biggest crime of the 20th century.
[comment]I'm not sure how he's gonna recover. 

He's gonna have to go in and look at the economy. 

He's going to have to look at healthcare and the economy. 

The only way he'll recover is if he can't find anyone who can work at all.
[comment]I can't believe how low life expectancy has plummeted in these last 20 years
[comment]I think we're all very culpable[comment]How about Biden for president[comment]If he can't recover the economy[comment]Well[comment]The only reason Trump won was because he's too divisive to deal with.  

I don't think he can recover the economy. 

The only way he'll recover is if he can't find anyone who can work at all. 

Meanwhile[comment]I don't think anyone can recover from this. 

But it's just a fact that Trump has a lot of money to spend and there's no way he can do anything about it. 

It's a fact that Biden's handling of the crisis has made it worse and worse for the country

[comment]I think it'd be interesting to see how the legal consequences of this would be handled. As a lawyer you should be able to bring your case and your case won't be on the stand. As a Trump supporter I think it's very likely you won't get a fair trial.
[comment]Meh[comment]Wow[comment]I wonder if he is being prosecuted on trump's election grounds? 

I'd love to see a video of the fight.
[comment]I think he is in jail. 

Maybe he's being indicted on trump's so called campaign finance violations too. 

Maybe he's being held without bond.

[comment]This is exactly why I love Coronavirus. It's like a virus that is supposed to persist forever[comment]I am so shocked. The only reason I see the virus is because I have to deal with it more often than I ever did before.
[comment]I just wanna say everyone is also welcome to come out to the rally and protest. 

I am so glad I live in an area where the virus infects people more often than it does other people.
[comment]Can you imagine if the Russians knew what was in store for the people who have to live with it for the rest of their lives?
[comment]I have a feeling it will be a good rally though.
[comment]Well[comment]Perhaps the only reason I felt the need to do so. 

I feel like I jump on the bandwagon that trump is happy to save lives and let his people live. 

I have to admit that I was a little bit taken aback by this.  The rally was not a protest or anything. It was just a few people.  I was actually at the event and was not able to get up in time.  The crowd was in full force. The left side of the crowd was clearly wearing masks.  This was an open address and was not a rally.  

The left side of the crowd was wearing masks. 

The right side of the crowd was wearing masks.  The left side of the crowd was wearing masks.  

I had a few people come out for the rally just to see the maskers.
[comment]It's not the virus that's the problem.
[comment]They shouldn't be allowed to speak.
[comment]I'm an independent. We have to do what we can to prevent others from speaking.
[comment]You can't go to a rally and pretend the virus isn't there.
[comment]We need to get them to their camps.

[comment]Given the current state of the economy[subtext]The reason I am so critical of politicians and media is because they are so easily manipulated by the right. They can manipulate the narrative and make any argument they want. They can't help but make it seem like this has been going on for years and they just can't seem to get the message out. This is why so many people are so terrified of Donald Trump.
[comment]As long as the left is so easily manipulated by the right[comment]I don't know[comment]I might as well start a thread about how we can make it so all we have to do is listen to the left and see how they have been doing this.

Maybe we should get rid of the coronavirus containment center because it's being used to store and administer coronavirus viruses.

The US is a democracy. At some point they have to do something about the pandemic.

It's going to happen here in the US
[comment]Will the US eventually do something about it?
[comment]I feel like we need to work on a new drug strategy or something. I hope it's an independent sector of the economy that will not be affected by this.

[comment]I can't be bothered to read the news and do anything about it.  It’s horrifying that it’s happening in the US. We need to keep pushing for more testing and testing nurses and ensure everyone has proper healthcare before people get sick.
[comment]If the US had been able to do this[comment]Oh no.

This isn't going to happen.

It’s going to happen here in the US.
[comment]I have to agree that this is not going to happen. It's going to happen here in the US. And by the way[comment]It's not going to happen in the US.

It's going to happen here in the US.
[comment]Go to the polls.
[comment]This is a major reason why the left keeps trying to shut down Trump’s campaign in the US.

[comment]I have to agree with how I feel about this. It would not be a big deal if the US could not be shut

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

I remember being really sad at the thought of him ever being able to get along with the people who had the 4th amendment.

[comment]Why the fuck would anyone believe that?

Saying that's the way it is would be a fool's errand.

[comment]He's going to lose.
[comment]I hope he wins.
[comment]The only way to win in November is if all the candidates agree on a better way to handle the situation. 

What I do think is a lot of this is probably a result of trump and his supporters trying to please their base and not the GOP.
[comment]In my opinion[comment]Wow[comment]I hope he loses.

[comment]The media is full of bullshit.
[comment]I am sure there are people who think that this is a smart move by the media. I don't think that is true. If the government then wants to keep those people in prison for life and responds by closing down the government without a trial or trial, then that's a smart move.
[comment]You have to ask yourself why the media is playing with the truth when the people who are lying about the virus aren't lying about the government? Why aren't they saying the same thing about trump?

I think we're all just a grown-up having a little fun with it.

[comment]Good.

Edit: I am now citing the Justice Dept statement on the matter.
