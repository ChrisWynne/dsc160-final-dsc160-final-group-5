[comment]You can find an article on this sub here[comment]I don't like cops shooting and killing people. I disagree with you on this[comment]They are never going to be perfect. But it is still the problem and it's still the solution.
[comment]That's the whole point of the argument. If you don't believe me[comment]This is exactly the point that I am most worried about in the first place. I don’t think you need to be a racist to be a racist. It's just that I don't think it’s completely obvious from what I've seen on the news that the police aren’t the problem.

You guys should all go back to your "I’m white and I’m not racist" mentality.

[title]Bernie Sanders: "We are not a party of billionaires. We are a party of working families."
[selftext]https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/bernie-sanders-we-are-not-a-party-of-charity-welfare-pension-shelter-security-mood-report[comment]I agree with him.  The main problem with Bernie is that he does not have the infrastructure or the platform to lead an effective government.  Democrats and their media allies are worse at doing just that.  The economy is slowing and we are still being hammered by unemployment and the state budget hole.   

The only real hope that Bernie has is if he rallies a lot of people to vote for him. 

I think he should get a second term or something[comment]Well...we need more Bernie bros[comment]Democrats aren't a party of billionaires[comment]I’m not a Bernie bro.  They’re just a bunch of billionaires that influence the world. 

Bernie is a billionaire.  I hope he’s running for President again. 

It's a matter of who is in charge. 
I’m not a Bernie bro[comment]WTF?!?!?

No money from Bernie on a grand scale?

I'd like to hear from Bernie. 

Is there something else you would like to hear?
[comment]I agree with Bernie that a lot of people are not going to vote for him because they think he is a socialist.
But...why are the democrats against the welfare state?

To me that's why they can’t win.
[comment]Bernie is the single most important politician in this election.
[comment]I agree with Bernie that a lot of people are voting Republican. It's not a bad thing to do[comment]Bernie is the best thing that could happen to the system. I'm a Bernie supporter.
[comment]I just thought this was a very good point.
[comment]The Bernie supporters are the ones that are most likely to vote for Bernie.
[comment]God bless you Bernie.
[comment]I will vote for Bernie if he is the nominee.
[comment]Bernie is a socialist and a democrat.
[comment]The only thing that would make him the nominee is that he is a billionaire.
[comment]I think the only thing that would make Bernie the nominee is that he is a billionaire. 

The only thing that would make Bernie the nominee is that he is a billionaire.

[comment]What is the solution to all of this? None of the above. 

A few more months.
[comment]I think most of you are right[comment]I don't care if it's because of racism or whatever. The police force is the answer.  

We need to stop the rioters on our streets. We need to stop the violence. 

Then the cops will move in and stop the rioters...
[comment]This is the point I want to make.  I believe that the police are the problem.  They have no authority over us and they're still the ones who create the problem.  It's not the protesters that are the problem[comment]No[comment]Am I seeing a**[comment]The rioters that are blocking traffic are the ones that are behind the protesters.
[comment]Why is the police in riot gear?

[comment]Trump is acting like nothing has changed.
[comment]We have to let his people do whatever they want.
[comment]I agree with everyone. The police and military do a good job at preventing the spread of radical ideas. I think we need to stop electing the mediocre people over the people who seek to keep the country safe.
[comment]Never underestimate the power of the political party.
[comment]I'm not a Trump supporter[comment]Trump was also very critical of Barack Obama. I feel like he was not the best counter-protector against the virus.
[comment]The left has lost their minds. 

The left has lost their hearts.
[comment]I have a hard time believing he still cares about the election.
[comment]He is actually the most qualified person to be president and I would say he is the best.

If someone has this level of talent.

I would say he is losing his mind.
[comment]I don't think he cares.
[comment]No[comment]He is the best.
[comment]I like him because he is the best. 

I like him because he is the best. 

I like him because he is the best.
[comment]He is the best.

[comment]It's hard to say what the people that are most affected by this are.

I think it is obvious that the left is the real problem. I think we need to learn from the mistakes of the last few years.
[comment]I don't have a preference for Trump. I don't think he is a good leader.
[comment]I agree that the left needs to be re-elected. We need to stop pretending that Trump is a legitimate leader. He is a puppet of the left.
[comment]This is why I don't despise him[comment]I am a Trump supporter[comment]I would get behind him if he was impeached.
[comment]I hate him for this. I despise him for the other sins of the last few years.

[comment]This is how the left talks.
[comment]Makes me so mad.
[comment]I like my right hand
I think police brutality is fine
I don't think the left will be the only cause of this issue.
[comment]I thought that the left was just going to shut down cities because of riots
No[comment]Everyone is getting arrested

If you're a cop you should be arrested
[comment]So keep protesting
[comment]Because we are all screwed
[comment]I'm not a fan of the police brutality of everyday life. It's just not the enforcement of law.
[comment]What is the most common reason people are arrested for protesting?
[comment]This is going to be a long article...

And I can't sleep at the thought of all the people being arrested for protesting in order to protest the police brutality.

I hate to sound like an asshat[comment]The left has no place in the context of the common man.
[comment]I don't think protesting is a necessary evil
I don't think that people should be arrested for protesting and I don't think it is wrong to protest.
[comment]Where do people get the "left" ideas on this?
[comment]Feminists don't *really* want you arrested for protesting. They want you arrested.  They want you to be arrested for protesting.
[comment]I don't support police brutality[comment]I don't like the way the left talks.  They don't understand human rights.  They don't need to be told that there are rights that they don't fully understand. They just need to listen to people.
[comment]They should be arrested for protesting.
[comment]I don't think that protesting is a direct result of any activity
The left has no place in our culture[comment]I don't agree[comment]I think the problem is the lack of a balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of the collective. 

I think that the problem is the way we teach our kids that "it's not OK to be black or LGBT or believe in a lesser evil". 

The Right should be holding lessons for their kids.
[comment]Oops.
[comment]The left is only interested in doing what they can to please their base.
[comment]The left is not a party to protesting[comment]I dont think it is wrong to protest.

But there is no right to protest.

So their arguments are just *consent* to being arrested and being arrested.

The only way to keep them from being arrested is to force people to protest.
[comment]I don't agree with the idea of protesting.

The right is a party to protesting.
[comment]I don't understand the right is not a party to protesting.

But there are certain things that we are obligated to do as a society.

For example[comment]This was the best point of contention I've seen.
[comment]I don't know what to do with the left of anything
[comment]I don't like the left. Why are they so angry that Bernie Sanders is staying home from the Democratic convention.
[comment]I have a hard time believing they would even support Bernie Sanders in the general.
[comment]If that needs repeating
[comment]Dont forget the right is just a bunch of people who are fighting for their own personal agendas.
[comment]I don't disagree with the left on anything. The left doesn't give a shit.
[comment]I don't think exposing people's private lives is the right thing to do[comment]I don't think the left would choose a candidate that would protect their base
[comment]I don't support protests[comment]I think the right is trying to silence people by trying to silence republican voters.
[comment]The right is more concerned with keeping the left from protesting. You can protest without the left having any say in it.
[comment]I don't think protesting is a violation of any rights.

[comment]I think some people are just being a dick.
[comment]I think we need to agree that some people are worse than others.
[comment]I think all cops are bad. The last time I saw a black kid arrested for an act of civil disobedience was the same year.
[comment]I don't think cops should be responsible for riots.
[comment]Yeah I agree[comment]I don't get it.
[comment]I agree with you[comment]The problem with rioting is that it happens. It happens because cops chase people over the heads of protesters. That's a legitimate concern.
[comment]I agree with you.
[comment]Do you ever see people who say they're black and say that they are.
[comment]A few people say they aren't.
[comment]I don't think cops are bad. I don't think they're bad.

The problem is that there's always a guy or girl on the other side of the law.

I don't see a lot of cops who are against rioting.
[comment]I don't think that rioting is bad.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]The theory that the cops are bad is that they are man and woman.
[comment]I don't think it's racist to complain about police brutality. I think there's a lot of people out there that should be protesting.
[comment]I get it. It's ok to complain about bad cops[comment]I'm not a racist. I don't feel that way. But I do have a few people saying that cops are bad.
[comment]If we don't stand up for black lives[comment]I don't have a single cop who is against the idea of the black man being killed by police.

I agree with you.
[comment]I don't think there's anything racist about protesting.

If you have a group of twenty people protesting then you are protesting against cops.

The only person I don't see as a racist is the black man.
[comment]Nothing beats a peaceful protest in a neighborhood where someone is protesting.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]I agree with you.
[comment]I think while rioting isn't a crime[comment]I agree. The problem is that everyone has a right to protest. 

I think if you want to support people protesting[comment]Yeah
[comment]We all know that there aren't many black people arrested for rioting[comment]No[comment]I don't think there's a problem with rioting
[comment]I disagree.
[comment]Yeah
[comment]I think the problem is that people are afraid of cops. 

I don't think that it's evil for the cops to be violent or that the cops are bad. The only way to combat it is to stop and think about what the problem is.
[comment]I don't think black people should be arrested for protesting. I think that they should be arrested for protesting
[comment]I think the problem is that we all have a right to protest.
[comment]I agree.

It's not that we don't protest. It's that people don't protest.
[comment]I don't know what the problem is with protesting[comment]I am a black man and I just went to protest.
[comment]Just because the cops are bad doesn't mean they shouldn't be.
[comment]I don't think there's a problem with protesting.

I think if we get involved in a peaceful protest[comment]I don't see any black people arrested for protesting.
[comment]I agree with you.
[comment]I agree with you.

[comment]What about the correct explanation?
[comment]Such a good start!
[comment]End of the interview! This is the end of the story!
[comment]I'm not sure how Trump would respond if a white man was killed by a cop. I can't say for sure. I'd say that a white man is more likely to be killed by a cop than a black man. I'm not sure what Trump's response would be. I have a feeling that Bush would be more inclined to endorse him. But I just don't understand how he would respond.
[comment]So many white nationalist cultists.
[comment]The only thing that matters is that Trump agrees with how he sees the world and can use it to his advantage.
[comment]If he didn't like the way the civil rights movement was treated by the Nazis[comment]Can anyone explain to me why he is still trying to justify the use of SWAT teams on protesters?
[comment]One main reason why the police need to be put on a higher priority list is that they are overprotective of peaceful protesters. That is why the police have to do the absolute minimum.
[comment]I'd like to see Trump try to explain why he doesn't like the way things are going in the protests and the protests aren't interested in his welfare.
[comment]I think he needs to do a drink of water.
[comment]Yeah[comment]They're trying to get a baby removed from the womb of a baby because they don't want the baby to smell like a baby.
[comment]What do you think? Is he suggesting that the baby should smell like a baby? Or is he just saying that the baby has a smell that makes him feel better?
[comment]This is what the police are for. This is how they make people do things.
[comment]What he didn't say was that the protests are a direct result of the protests.
[comment]As a white male and a gun owners rights supporter[comment]I don't think it's in the best interest of the nation to have officers arrested for being peaceful protesters. The protests aren't protesting either.

The protests aren't taking place and therefore they aren't protests.
[comment]Omg you're the only one to notice the difference.
[comment]Just curious.
[comment]Look at the way police officers are reacting to protesters.

I want to be a cop. I want to be a citizen for the right reasons. No cop in the world is going to do that.
[comment]I think Trump should be unified in his statement.
[comment]I think he needs to be clarified that what he is saying is not what he is actually saying.
[comment]It would be funny if the feds were a bunch of homoerotic pigs.
[comment]I think Trump should be aware that the protesters aren't protesting. It's a protest[comment]I don't understand why they don't use the word "police" twice in different sentences.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]It's not the protesters.
[comment]It's the protesters that are being arrested.
[comment]Just overall...
[comment]I'd rather be a cop than a thug.
[comment]What is the point of protesting if you're an officer and you like the cops?
[comment]I liked the line two years ago about putting an officer in the middle of the street.
[comment]Is there a process in place to separate the two parties and have everyone involved with the protests be punished for non criminal behavior?
[comment]So we are forcing them to be the same way?
[comment]They're just protesting[comment]That's a good thing.
[comment]What if the police say "I don't think we should use force" and we all just ignore it?

[comment]I don't think it's possible to be a peaceful protest without being arrested.

[comment]Hillary is not the type to be a threat to young voters
[comment]I don't think we need any more than that.
[comment]Yeah[comment]I'd vote for her
[comment]I don't think it's fair that young people should be disenfranchised by a woman who is 77 and has the baggage of a 70 year old.
[comment]Hillary is the only person in our party that could potentially be the most popular candidate in a primary.
[comment]The left is so focused on the 2020 election that they just have to be totally closed off from the 2020 election.
[comment]I've always been against voting for a woman.  I don't agree with making sure everyone has the same right to vote rights but I don't know anyone who doesn't have that right
I am not convinced that Hillary won all the people they nominated.  Those people could still defeat her.

But I feel like they're getting off with a few extra votes.
[comment]I'm voting for Hillary. I don't know why I should but it scares me.

[comment]Uh-huh. The police have always been bad.
[comment]I was thinking of an explanation for your comment on how all this violence by the cops is a form of political correctness.
[comment]Well[comment]You mean to say that every time a police officer kills a citizen they are justified in shooting that citizen?
[comment]I don't think people aren't aware of the fact that the cops are the most violent group of people.
[comment]I don't think the police force is the most violent group of people.

[comment]What do you mean by this?
[comment]It's a form of political correctness.
[comment]I don't think it's the only thing that affects somebody.
[comment]I just think it's a form of political correctness.

[comment]I think the cops should be the first line of defense against a criminal.

I think the more people aware of the fact that the police are the most violent group of people
The more people that are actually violent.
[comment]So I agree
We should be the first line of defense in all cases
And the other people that are a little bit more civil
So I think the cops should be the first line of defence.
[comment]It is the duty of the police to protect and serve everyone that is in their way.
[comment]I think you want to put people in a position where they have to do everything they can to prevent them from doing the same thing. That's what the constitution says.
[comment]I'm a Law enforcement officer and have always believed that the police were the enemy of the people[comment]I don't think so. I think people should not be allowed to be the judge and jury in public court.
[comment]And the point that is making me mad.
[comment]Why would they be the enemy of the people?
[comment]You know what the problem is besides the fact that people who are violent do not have any recourse because the police are the enemy of the people?
[comment]You have to have a middle ground. All the cops have to do is hold the people accountable[comment]I agree.
[comment]I'm a police officer and I'm not afraid of the police. They can be violent and that's fine
I think the police should be the first line of defence.

But the people that are the enemy of the people should be the ones that protect the people.
[comment]I don't think that asking the people to defend themselves against the police is an obligation and should be treated like one. I think a lot of people are asking people to defend themselves then[comment]I agree[comment]The fact that the people that are the enemy of the people can't be the ones that harm them is a great thing because it means people are thinking twice about the cops.
[comment]That's why I’m against it. They need to be the first line of defence.
[comment]It really doesn't matter if you're a bad cop or a bad person. If you look at a lot of cops and they try to take you under their wing then you're an enemy. If you look at the behavior of the cops you're an enemy. If you look at the people you're an enemy and you don't feel like defending yourself you're a enemy.
[comment]I'm a police officer and I'm not afraid of the police.

[comment]They aren't. They've been doing this for years. It is their fault they're here.
[comment]I don't think they need to be involved in protests. Just as well they should have been raiding a lot of churches just to tackle the rioters.
[comment]I think the point is that the police are those who are idiotic and evil and they should be treated like that.
[comment]The rioters were being "civilized" and the rioters weren't.

[comment]I don't support all of these things. I understand that they're bad but the difference as far as I'm concerned is that the rioters are the ones that have to stop protesting. In that case they should be arrested.

The rioters are not peaceful protestors. They are rioters.

[comment]As a liberal
I think cops need to be arrested for rioting.  If they don't do something right it will just be more people getting arrested and more protests.
[comment]I don't agree with everything you say about this[comment]What is your take on this?
[comment]I'm thinking of a hypothetical case where a bunch of protestors riot and then the police break up the protests and the people are killed. What happens? The protesters get their hands on the body of the cop and then the protesters are killed. When that happens don't dismiss protests as just a bunch of people rioting.

[selftext]https://www.politico.com/news/trump-wont-pull-out-of-mta-deal-shes-a-possible-crisis-in-year-2020-2[comment]It's a non-starter.
[comment]Not a bad deal for one country that could have bankrupted the entire planet.
[comment]It'll probably be a laughing stock to watch.
[comment]How do you know?
[comment]Good. We know it was a mistake. It was a mistake we should have made. We should have called the president and said:

"This deal is not a bad deal. It's a bad trade agreement."

Then he and his team would have been in a better position to respond.
[comment]It's a sham.
[comment]Of course not.
[comment]It still will be a laughing stock.
[comment]I still support the deal.
[comment]I think the Russian government has a lot of influence over what we do. I think Donald Trump is a bad president.

I'm not sure that I agree with the whole thing but I would say that all the other countries going forward are going to have to be a lot more careful with their trade dealings.

I think we should have been very careful with the break up of the Ukraine for a while.

And we should have been very cautious with the North Korea trade.

But yet we still have the most important thing in this election. The election.

We will get rid of the trade deals we had negotiated and we will get rid of Trump.

We will get rid of the corrupt and incompetent Trump administration.

I mean

Republicans will be back in power in 2020

[comment]I agree[comment]I don’t think a human being who shoots a modern day rat should be held liable for their actions. 

I’m not sure why the police would demand that a human being be held responsible for their actions. It’s a sign of society’s progress that people are more assertive and tend to act more quickly.

The point is to protest against the police brutality and brutality.

The protesters should be arrested.

[comment]The problem is that the party that brokered the riots is the Republican party
And I don’t support Trump because of his policies and because of his policies.

I’m an American.
[comment]I live in the UK.
[comment]Why not just ignore the fact that this isn’t a peaceful protest?

[comment]It’s not peaceful. It’s riot. And you are a criminal.  You should be arrested for rioting.
[comment]That’s really the point of the post. The fact that the left has developed their own view of the world and that the right is just becoming more and more anti-democratic in their ranting is evidence of their lack of understanding of the left.

Hillary is a better candidate than Trump.

[comment]If you truly think anyone would be surprised by the level of violence being committed against unarmed people in the US today you're not making a good point. It's the same with the [police brutality] “black bloc”.
[comment]It's easy to ignore it because it's the ignorant response to a threat to the very unity that makes a nation work.
[comment]I don’t see why the US needs to be a police state and not a democracy.

[comment]I agree with you that we should not be blameless in the face of an armed attack.

But what I don't agree with is the level of violence that we see being committed against people of color.

It’s a very difficult issue to get involved in. Every single day
It's a war that has been won. It’s not a war that leads to peace. It’s a war that places people at risk.
[comment]The only difference is it’s a war.

The only difference is that if a country is being attacked[comment]I don’t think we should be a police state. However[comment]The problem is that white people are much more likely to be violent than people of color.

People of color are more likely to be killed by police.
[comment]We need to stop thinking about the physical content of the crimes.

The United States is a nation of laws. And white people are just as likely to be killed by police officers as white people are by other races.

We also need to have a policy of not focusing on the white people because that would get us into trouble (it doesn't).

[comment]No[comment]I think the right is the same way. You can't simply point to a place to live that you are not welcome. Saying something that is not consistent with your values or the company you work for is still considered violent.

[comment]The police violence is not a problem.

[comment]The majority of people aren’t going to be arrested for protesting and protesting.
[comment]I'm not a fan of the idea that the police are being targeted and abused. They should be treated like any other citizen in the city.
[comment]I think the problem is the lack of adequate resources and the amount of power being handed to the police.
[comment]I don’t care if you are a white person or not[comment]I think that's a good thing. 

People who are arrested do not have the power to protest.

They have the power to go to jail and they can protest and demand that they are arrested.

If you want to call them tits
[comment]I think it’s the lack of power to organize and co-opt the police that's actually the problem. 


The police aren’t the ones who are oppressed by the Black people. The problem is that the police aren’t the ones that are oppressed by the Black people. 

Time for a change.
[comment]The police are the focus of the problem.
[comment]The last 30 years has been a time when the police have been used to protect the criminal from the majority of citizens.

But I think that's why it's a problem.

The amount of power the police have is the problem.

[comment]The left always seems intent on quelling any meaningful debate about racism and liberals are very aware of that.
[comment]That's the problem with the left. They almost always make excuses for themselves to get in the way of actual debate. Im sure they will find the time to troll their supporters again.
[comment]Just because you're an asshole that you're a bad person.
[comment]I'm a white man and I agree with other people who are bad. I also agree that racism is a problem and that it's bad for us to be that way.  In fact the main goal of the left is to make white people feel bad for being the bad ones.
[comment]I can understand how conservatives are trying to make white people feel bad for being the bad ones[comment]Edit[comment]Well[comment]But the left loves to make people feel bad for being the bad ones
[comment]Just look at how many people are saying they have no empathy for the brown people. It's gross.

The left wants to make everyone feel bad for being the bad ones.  And there are so many people who feel like racist.  We need to do something about it.
[comment]I am a white man and I agree with others that racism is a problem. But I also agree with people who feel bad for being the bad ones.  And that's why it's so hard to get people to admit they are racist.

Yeah but the left does not even realize that their goal is to make everyone feel bad for being the bad ones.

The only people who have any empathy for the browns are the ones who are only protesting because they want to be the bad ones.
[comment]I was like "well[comment]It's all about the white people who are the bad ones
[comment]And they are the ones who are the bad?
[comment]Exactly right
[comment]The left has zero empathy for people of color.
[comment]Lol.
[comment]I mean[comment]I just don't understand why that's the case.
[comment]When the left says "we're all bad" they are talking about all of us.

But they are all the bad ones as well.
[comment]I agree with people on the left. If you hate the white person for throwing a tantrum[comment]If you are literally the bad ones[comment]I’m not a member of this sub[comment]I think the point is that being bad is a bad thing. That’s not how we like to think.

That being said
I don’t agree with the way the left is trying to attack anyone. They were trying to make people feel bad for the people they were attacking.
[comment]Stereotypes are a bad thing.
[comment]The left should not be making people feel bad for the bad ones.
[comment]I agree.

I'm a white male and I feel very bad for being white. I’d rather have a kid with Asian parents (I'm Asian).

I do not hate the white person[comment]I’d like to think that the left is trying to make people feel bad for the bad ones.   But better to be nice to one group than the other.
[comment]I agree.

I’m not a racist.
[comment]I don’t agree with them.
[comment]They are so obsessed with how a person is perceived[comment]I think the point is that people are afraid of the bad ones.
[comment]I don't get it.

The left is trying to make people feel bad for the bad ones.
[comment]The left has zero empathy for people of color.
[comment]But they are the bad ones.
[comment]I agree but I can’t get to the point where I feel bad for being white.
[comment]The left is trying to make people feel bad for the bad ones.
[comment]I’m not a racist.
[comment]I don’t hate the white person.
[comment]But the left is trying to make people feel bad for being the bad ones.

[comment]If we don't stop the riots[comment]Is this really the right place?
[comment]But[comment]I mean the goal is to make the riots go away
How are we able to do that if we're just supporting the ones who are being killed?
[comment]So how do I know?
[comment]I don't know. I'm not a fan of the political correctness and the lefty political correctness of the left. I'm just pro-police brutality and fighting back against the leftist cops
I still feel the riots are a necessary part of the solution
You know what I'm saying? If we're all just supporting the ones who are being murdered 
So
I didn't try to link to Reddit at the time.
[comment]My point is[comment]They're not protesting because they're being killed. They're protesting because they want a better life for themselves and the community.
[comment]This is just another layer of the problem.
[comment]I think there should be more funding for non-violent protests. These kinds of protests are just a way for the left to not only justify their policies but also to play into their hands.
[comment]What's difference between protesting?
[comment]Why would a bunch of people protest when another group of people are murdered?
[comment]If I was a black man I would protest[comment]Why would anyone protest if there was a gun in the house?
[comment]If you're an immigrant and you have a job and your kids are going to school then protesting is an illegal activity.
[comment]The left has no backbone. Not only are they making life unsafe for people of color[comment]No[comment]The left is a serious problem. The left doesn't care about the lives of people who are killed by the police or the LGBT community. They're just going to fix whatever the police brutality crimes are

[comment]The people who are calling for a man to be arrested or charged with a violent crime are not protesting when a police officer is shooting and killing citizens.
[comment]You want to know what you're doing?


This sub is why I'm calling for the arrest of any and every cop.
[comment]The rest of the officers are just protestors protesting.
[comment]You know.

There are times when a protest is peaceful[comment]for me[comment]The reason we have to be trying to arrest the bastard is that if we do this every time a protest occurs

The reason we have to be doing this is to enforce the law.
[comment]I agree[comment]You just need to be aware of the context of what you're saying.

It's not illegal if you're protesting. It's illegal to protest.

[title]Bernie or Bust?
[selftext]https://thehill.com/opinion/articles/democratic-party-elected-presidential-party-wont-be-in-party-for-a-year-likely-to-become-democratic-party
[comment]I have great respect for Bernie Sanders and his supporters.  He has a base that knows how to take the party by the horns and beat it. But I don't think it's a good thing for democracy to be governed by the party of establishment politicians.
[comment]Yeah[comment]We're all still in the same boat.

When Bernie Sanders says that he thinks the party of the working class is the solution to this problem.

Then we'll know that he's right.

The whole party isn't the solution.
[comment]The problem is the working class is the ones that are being disenfranchised and disenfranchised in our society. Bernie is the solution.
[comment]I'm voting for Bernie because he's a democratic.
[comment]Imagine if the people who work in the corporate media were chosen to run the country
[comment]Bernie is the only one that can change the country.
[comment]I feel Sanders has the best chance of winning though. He seems to be focusing on economic issues and is making good on his campaign promise to repeal the "Obamacare" and start over.
[comment]Bernie's numbers don't add up.  He has a hard time getting people to vote.  He has a hard time winning in rural areas.  He has very little chance of winning in urban areas.  He has a hard time beating Trump in the polls.
[comment]I don't know if it's a good thing for the working class or not but Bernie eventually has to be defeated.
[comment]I agree
[comment]No
[comment]I think he's above the law[comment]I'm voting for Bernie.
[comment]I'm voting for Bernie because I think Bernie is the right man for the job.  I don't care about the status quo.  Bernie is the wrong man for the job.  I don't think Bernie is the best person to lead the country.  I just think he should be the president.  If he had a chance the election would not have been that bad.
[comment]Bernie is the only one that is able to unite the party.  It's Bernie's fault that the two parties are so polar. 

If we want a stable electoral system
I don't think Bernie is the best person to lead the country either.  He has the best chance of getting the nomination.  If Bernie goes down I will vote for Bernie.  Bernie needs to win the election.
[comment]I agree
[comment]I think Bernie is the best person to lead the country.  I didn't think Bernie was the best person to run the country.  He has the best chance of winning in rural areas. The only thing that's going to make Bernie the better candidate is if everyone votes the same way.  We should all vote the same way.

[comment]I don't think the police have any other choice.
[comment]I don't agree with all of that

But if you don't like the police brutality... you should stay home[comment]I think the primary purpose of the divide is to make the argument that there are people protesting because cops were not there to protect them. It is not a civil protest.
[comment]I don't see any reason why this shouldn't be a topic of discussion. People should be able to express their opinions without being arrested.
[comment]Thoughts
[comment]I would like to hear some actual facts about the protests and what they are really protesting about.
[comment]They are protesting against police brutality. Someone started a riot and it quickly spread to all of the other cities.
[comment]They are protesting against police brutality... just like the protesters are protesting against the military.
[comment]This is just an opinion.
[comment]There is a legitimate protest against the state of the union but it ends up being a peaceful protest where the protestors turn violent.
[comment]I agree that the way things are currently going is that there are people protesting against the police
But just because something is peaceful doesn't give it a right to be peaceful.
[comment]I dont think it's an actual issue as long as the protests aren't in retaliation for the state of the union
So I don't see any reason to participate in that[comment]So I don't see any reason to participate in that?
[comment]How do you know what is peaceful?
[comment]I like to read the posts on the right and the left. I think that's what the left tries to do.
[comment]This is actually an issue that the police have been doing for the last few decades. It was not the protests they are protesting against.  It was the riots where their militia turned violent whenever they got an opportunity.

It was the protestors who were responsible for the riots.
[comment]10 arrests this year

[comment]The right-leaning media is a cesspool of lies[comment]I don't care about the statistics but if there were riots in the US this would be the best time to start protesting.
[comment]I don't think the rioters were trying to stop the US from getting a second term at all.
[comment]I agree with the left. I don't think that it was peaceful. It was a protest. People protesting against the state of the union. People rioting against the state of the union.
[comment]Fuck the left.
[comment]I don't think protests are a legitimate protest.
[comment]I think it's important to understand that each person is different and that any one protest can apply to all people.
[comment]I think the left is playing at the game of dividing people. What the left won't do is to divide people or to push people apart. If you want the left to have any kind of power under the Constitution[comment]I think if people had a full understanding that the US government was doing their job[comment]No[comment]I think they are playing at the same time with the CCP.  There are a lot of entities that are more authoritarian[comment]I agree that there are protests and rioters but I think it's important to know that people protesting against the government aren't protesting against the government.

They are protesting against the corrupt government.

I remember when I was a kid

I know it's a "trend" that seems from a distance
But I’ll be happy to agree that the number of rapes against black people is not a significant portion of the overall increase.

I would expect this will be one of the most difficult issues to address.

[comment]I disagree with your definition of what we are being asked to do. What we are being asked to do is to arrest people and remove them from the street and do whatever comes to pass.  It is a form of physical force.
[comment]Let me try to explain one thing. If I see a white cop or a black cop with a baton on my head.   It is a physical assault.   If a white person were to just walk up to you and say "Hey look that could be violent.    

It should not be a physical assault.  

If a black person and a white person walk into a car and start throwing bottles at each other.   

If you don't have a baton on your head.  

It should be a physical assault. 

I think you're definitely not saying that the police should be using their batons to stomp on people in a peaceful manner. 

But
I don't think we should be asking people to do things.  

I would rather have people who are peaceful being arrested for doing things that are violent than people who are violent being arrested for doing things that are peaceful.
[comment]I've seen the title on the right.
[comment]It is a form of physical force.

It is a physical assault.

And if people are arrested and removed from the street
then they are being arrested for doing things that are violent. 

And if you are on a property line
then you are being arrested for doing things that are peaceful.
[comment]I don't understand the Nazi party's response to the Nazis. If you don't have a political party that is against what is happening on the streets then you don't have a right to protest or protest.
[comment]I don't care if the police do it or not.  If a black person walks into a white person car and kicks the black person in the face or is hit by a baton.

If the person is black or Asian and is arrested for that
The only thing that matters is that they are arrested.

The person arrested is the one that is being arrested.
[comment]I don't think it is a physical assault. It is a physical assault.
[comment]I just think we should be asking people specifically to do the physical assault.

Politics is about the destruction of others. The left is the one that has got us all in a state of deep depression.
[comment]I think they are going to lose every election on the way out.
[comment]I don't like the left. It wants to destroy every other political party and make any other political party a cult.

I think the mainstream media will continue to be a source of real outrage and frustration. Despite the fact that the Democrats are going to win every election for the next 30 years. 

I think the primary elections will be a disaster. There will be lots of empty seats and a lot of people who either don't want to vote for them or are afraid to vote for them. 

The left is a cult.
[comment]So we should just let them win?
[comment]They are not the lesser of two evils.
[comment]I agree. Let them win. Let them lose.
[comment]If we don't win
We have no chance.
[comment]I'm here to tell you that the democrats are the ultimate victims of this cult. They ask themselves: what would happen if the same thing happened to the republicans?

For me this is the most important thing.

I think they have to be the ones who can take the lead. They have to be the ones who take the lead.

The Left.

[comment]It's okay to be violent[comment]I got a call from a citizen of the UK saying they were going to arrest an activist and beat him up. 

I was very confused as to why the cops were doing this. 

I don't like this kind of that.
[comment]The police are absolutely terrible and they should be punished as such. 

Unfortunately[comment]The thing is[comment]I don't want to see these people arrested or arrested again. They're just doing their job.
[comment]I understand the argument for and against excessive force.
However you view it
I feel the police should be held to a higher standard and should not be treated worse than anyone else.
[comment]I don't think it's the police that should be blamed for the actions of these people.
[comment]They are not cops.
[comment]The underlying statement in the OP:

I would not want to see these people arrested

The police should be held in jail if possible

I have a feeling that the protesters will start to organize and get involved in the protests
[comment]Oh yeah[comment]Yes but the protests are much smaller than the rioters
[comment]I was wondering why they were being arrested for being peaceful and peaceful people.

I will say that rioters are not peaceful[comment]I don't want to see them arrested again
[comment]I believe they should be held in jail for their crimes.
[comment]They are just doing what is right.
[comment]This is not okay.
[comment]All the protestors are peaceful and peaceful protestors are not.
[comment]Yea[comment]I feel like I'm being a bastard.
[comment]More importantly[comment]Yes[comment]I agree.
[comment]They shouldn't be arrested for being peaceful and peaceful people. The rioters aren't. People shouldn't be arrested for being peaceful and peaceful people. The people who are arrested for being peaceful and peaceful people are being arrested for being peaceful and peaceful people.

The reason why they aren't arrested is because they are peaceful and peaceful people.
[comment]If you like what you see
I feel like my opinion on this is that cops shouldn't be charged with excessive force or the rioters aren't bad people.
[comment]I would like to see the protests stop for each other's peaceful protest.
[comment]It's okay to be violent and attack people
It's okay to be violent and attack people
Because that's how they are.

It's okay to be violent and attack people

[comment]The protests are peaceful and peaceful people are not.

Shit it's not the police
It's the same with the protestors
[comment]I agree.

The protests are peaceful and peaceful people are not.

I don't want to see these people arrested.
[comment]This is fine and normal.

It's just that people don't like being arrested for peaceful protest.
[comment]This is fine and normal.

It's just that people don't like being arrested for peaceful protest.

The riots aren't.

If people were peaceful they'd be doing pretty well
[comment]My opinion is that the riots are peaceful and peaceful people are not.
[comment]This is fine and normal.

It's just that people don't like being arrested for peaceful protest.
[comment]So how is that lawful and peaceful people being arrested?

The protesters are peaceful and peaceful people are not.

The riots aren't.

If people were peaceful they'd be doing pretty well.

It is a problem of police brutality. 

This is how the Democrats treat the issue.
[comment]I didn't realize that was a lefty comment...
[comment]Some people have a right to protest but I think they should be arrested
[comment]How does the left treat people when they are protesting?
[comment]I still don't understand the logic of "unlawful activities" like peaceful protests where the police force is the problem.
[comment]Yes you really can say "Second Amendment" without any regard for the constitution.
[comment]I don't think that's a right. It's just the way it is in the US.
[comment]I dont understand that right. The only way to defend the constitution is to say the police murder protesters. But there are still a large number of protesters[comment]I agree that there are too many people protesting in the streets. I don't agree that there are too many people protesting in the streets.
[comment]Right. What the fuck are you talking about?
[comment]The problem with the left is that protesting in the streets is against the constitution.
[comment]It is not a problem of police brutality. The problem is that people are committing violent crimes.

I'm not a fan of the fact that cops are also subject to the “leave “ policy. The only reason the left treats protests as a right is because it’s not a problem of the police.
[comment]I think the liberal media should be censoring their coverage of the protests. That would be a huge blow to the left.
[comment]I think the left does not have a right to protest.  It is a problem of people being arrested for protesting.
[comment]The left is fucked.
[comment]I don't know how the left can justify violent protests without taking the issue seriously.

Let me know if you want to keep them attached to the Constitution.

[comment]This is the worst sub of the sub that has yet to be banned.
[comment]If we ban it we will never get a real debate on this sub again.

The only reason this sub is still up is because the moderators blocked everyone following them.
[comment]I wanted to make this a point so I can post it here.
[comment]The best case scenario is that the moderators would have banned everyone for a few minutes as a result of a friendly fire.
[comment]This is really the only sub that does not discuss the individual cases of cops killing innocent people and all the others that have been investigated or exposed for a systemic problem.

We should ban it.
[comment]Can't even contain the number of people who will have their lives ruined by the banning of this sub.
[comment]The new sub is the sub that is being banned.
[comment]I'm not sure why this is the only sub where you can say the word "violently" without even trying. In a world where the police are the ones that arrest people for peaceful protests[comment]I've watched this sub for the last 6 months and I can tell you that every single one of the officers involved in the shooting death of Freddie Gray was black.
[comment]As a black person I don't like the way the sub is organized. There is no right to be a black person or a black person. The left is just trying to get their way.
[comment]This is the sub where the cops are actually horrible.
[comment]I think this is the sub for the left.
[comment]Just to be clear about what I'm saying.

The cops were human beings. You can't have ideas about why they are killing people and still be racist.
[comment]If this sub is banned[comment]I've been banned for a while.

I don't think it's fair.

I don't think it's fair for anyone to be kicked out of this sub.

But I will say that this sub is being banned because of the protests[comment]This is a Reddit sub. They literally hate people that protest[comment]This is the sub that is being banned.
[comment]The right is the best kind of racist.
[comment]Racism and xenophobia are two different things.
[comment]The cops are human beings and there is nothing they can do to stop them from doing what they are doing.
[comment]I agree with this sub as well.
[comment]Please stop being so gross.
[comment]The only way the left can keep their racist/white supremacist base is if they start spewing hate and violence and incite violence.
[comment]This is the sub that is being banned
[comment]There is no right to be a black person.

Black people are the problem and the solution is the police state.
[comment]I don't think we should be allowed to criticize the police. I think we should be allowed to criticize the left.

We should be allowed to criticize the left.
[comment]Just because you criticize the police doesn't mean you agree with them. Because it isn't a compliment or a criticism. It's just a compliment.
[comment]The left is the greatest threat the United States has since the Warsaw Ghetto riots.
[comment]I don't think the left is as evil as the Nazis were.

The only reason they hate the police is because they hate the left.

I like the idea of protesting but I hate the thought of protesting against the police. Especially when they're just taking shit with the system and not even bothering to look at the problem.
[comment]I'm not sure that anyone here could care less if the black people are being arrested or not. They're the ones that are being arrested and the cops are the ones who are taking anything that makes them uncomfortable.

The real problem here is that it's being kept hidden from the public by the Left. People are still trying to understand what it is that they want to be arrested for and why they're being held.

So
There are a lot of people in this sub
And they're all black.

You're right.

Black people have been arrested for anything.

And the black people have been arrested for nothing.

Just a quick guide to what the other party understands from your positions. For your discussions and debates on this sub and elsewhere. I didn't come up with it, I merely translated it from memory. Can't find the original source, sorry.
[comment]I'm not a social worker and this sub is for people that are emotionally or mentally disabled. As a result I would expect that people with mental disabilities would most likely be more likely to be violent.
[comment]The main point to make here is that most of the violence is 

1) by police brutality.
2) by folks being arrested.
3) by people being arrested for not wearing seat belts.
4) by people being arrested for not wearing seat belts.
5) by people being arrested for not being wearing seat belts.

I don't think it is important to point out the major points here. It is all about the exact same thing.
We all have our own opinions. We all know what works for everyone. But we all recognize that a lot of the violence is the same.
[comment]I don't think a lot of people realize that it is a bunch of people who riot.  

So I think it is important to be aware of when that is happening and to frame it in the context of the public perception of the situation
I think it's important to recognize that there are some issues at play here. 

One of the main points I have with the whole sub is that “The police brutality is “not a problem in the first place”. 

This is not a debate about the issue and it is not a debate about “The police brutality is a problem in the first place”.

It is a fact that the police brutality is a problem in the first place. 

I would love to see more people being arrested for being a cop but at the same time not being arrested for being a democrat or being a republican.
[comment]I felt like the first two points were fairly general.

1) the police brutality was a problem in the first place

2) the rioting was NOT a problem in the first place.

I agree with you.

We have to look at the real issue.

In the first place
It is important to understand that the 4th Amendment does not apply to the black population.

The black population is disproportionately affected by the police. In other words
The black population is disproportionately affected by the police.

I've been an officer for 10 yrs and black people are two of my favorite moments in my life.

[comment]The issue isn't that the police are racist.
[comment]The rioters were protesting against the police brutality
The issue is that the majority are the ones who are not protesting.

I don't think there is anything wrong with protesting against the cops.

The reason why people are protesting is because of the law.

But not the law.

The problem is that the majority of the people protesting are people with mental illness
The reason why the majority of people protesting are people with mental illness is because of the law.
[comment]Yeah[comment]We should all be protesting.
[comment]I don't know why people would do that.

I think that the vast majority of people protesting aren't protesting for the good of society.

The fact that people protesting is a protest is a protest.
[comment]The question is
How many people are protesting?

I think we should be protesting at least once a month.
[comment]I'm an officer now and I don't have any complaints.
[comment]This is a sub where people are protesting to protest.
[comment]I’m a democrat. I think we should be protesting every single day[comment]Well I’m not a democrat.
[comment]I agree with you but I’m not a republican. I’m not a republican.
[comment]I agree with you but I’m not a republican.
[comment]I'm not a republican but my opinion is that the majority of people protesting are people with mental illness.
[comment]I don’t care about the number of people protesting or the number of people protesting
I’m sure there are people protesting against the police but I’m not an individual protesting the set of injustices that the police are accused of causing.
[comment]I don't agree.

[comment]It's useful to think about policy when thinking.

[comment]I don't think that Joe Biden would be a good president. He is very wealthy and very good at public speaking. He is the best at putting himself first but he is also a wealthy rich guy who doesn't have the wealth to run for president. 

He has no experience in politics and has no experience in getting things done.  We need a leader who is open to the ideas of a president without being afraid to do anything. 

He has been a very busy man throughout his presidency and has been very busy with his campaign.  If we have a real leader who is willing to take responsibility for the situation[comment]I don't believe that Joe Biden has a tie to the deficit.  Biden has already proven he has the most debt in the history of the United States. 

So is he really a bad president?  I think he is

[comment]This is a meaningless meme.
[comment]It’s not the problem[comment]I can see why you think that is a good thing. There is a lot of police brutality and so many lives destroyed which is why you're being blamed for it. 

As a black man living in the South these protests are not going to succeed.
[comment]I’m not opposed to the use of force to stop a peaceful protest. 

But as a white man living in the South these protests are the cause of violent protests. 

In a nutshell

The problem is that riots keep happening because people think that the police are there to protect them. 

When you sit through a riot and the police can put you in a cell and arrest you for the crime you committed you are not protesting. 

When you protest[comment]You're wrong. As a white man living in the South[comment]I agree
[comment]I'm sure you're just being a little silly. This is a counterpoint to the idea that most people are peaceful protestors.
[comment]I agree[comment]I'm not opposed to the use of force to stop a peaceful protest
The problem is that rioters get caught.

We get arrested.

Then we are free to go back to our normal lives.
[comment]I don’t see it.

As a white man living in the South these protests are not going to succeed.
[comment]Protest is not a protest. 

I'm not opposed to the use of force to stop a peaceful protest.

But as a white man living in the South[comment]As a white man living in the South[comment]This is just the fake thing
The Left is going to try to start another riot a few weeks from now.
[comment]I disagree[comment]As a white man living in the South[comment]And the facts are that the police are there for the people who are protesting.
[comment]The police are there to protect the people who are protesting.

The issue is that people are protesting because they want to.
[comment]Yeah

I agree.
[comment]The danger of the Left running rioters is that they will call them protestors and a group of them will call them peaceful protestors.
[comment]You get the picture.
[comment]Honestly
The first thing they will do is silence you. If you call them protesters they will call you a racist and a rapist
[comment]I don't know why you would buy into that idea of inaction.
[comment]I'm a white man living in the South and I feel like a minority. I am protesting because I want people to be safe.
[comment]When people are peaceful[comment]I agree[comment]I was surprised you were not referring to protests as peaceful[comment]I don't agree with your view. The event is the issue
We are never free to protest. We are not free to protest.
[comment]I've always been a white man in the South. The reason why I live here is because white people want to produce products with color and they want to have their products with a certain color.
[comment]I don't know why you would think that[comment]It’s not the problem
I don't want to be a statistician[comment]I’m a white man and I support the police state.
[comment]I’m a white man and I feel like a minority. I am protesting because I believe in free speech and it’s not my place to be.
[comment]I agree with you. The main thing is they aren't doing their job properly and I don't think it's important to be a minority.
[comment]So you want the masses to be peaceful?

But what about the police?
[comment]I agree[comment]A veritable army of protestors is coming[comment]I don’t think they are.
[comment]I'm not a big believer in free speech
[comment]They are attacking people's rights and the people who defend them too.

[comment]I think that's what the good guys think.
[comment]Who cares if protestors are rioters?
[comment]That's my problem. I mean if they riot and attack whites[comment]This is a party that has lost sight of the fact that the most violent people in the world are the ones rioting and hurting each other.
[comment]I don't think you're trying to say that black people have to suffer for it.  Blacks have to suffer.  There are riots and assaults.  Black people have to suffer.  That's what we're doing.
[comment]It's all political.
[comment]Yeah[comment]Socialist utopia[comment]That's not a lot of words to describe it.

I think it's important to understand that the one thing you can agree on is that people riot.  They're usually violent and violent crimes.  And they're not peaceful.  It's all political.
[comment]I agree with you. People riot when they don't make a protest. That's not the right context for the term.
[comment]Is this a political party?
[comment]Yeah[comment]I agree with you. People riot when they don't make a protest. That's not the right context for the term.
[comment]What I'm trying to say here is

This is what people always say:

Yes[comment]I think we need to look at the situation from a different perspective.

This is an issue that developed from riots

Anyone who thinks that people are just rioting to burn down stores and houses or that the police are the ones being unreasonable is lying

It doesn't matter if you're protesting against an unjust arrest or a police misconduct; you're protesting against unjustified arrests.

If you're protesting against police misconduct[comment]Can you please say something about the children protesting?
[comment]Is this a party that supports violence?
[comment]No[comment]This is a political party. You can't say:

Yes[comment]I'm a communist supporter and I think a lot of the people protesting in this sub are being unreasonable.
[comment]I think the two parties are in a war.
[comment]I dont think that is the right one.
[comment]That was my theory.
[comment]You know that *we* have to fight and burn down houses and businesses.
[comment]How could you not support the rioters?
[comment]You should probably go and read the articles of theirs.
[comment]I think the way you phrased it in the first place is:

We have to keep fighting
We have to keep killing each other[comment]It's much easier for people riot than it is for peaceful people.
[comment]And the reason we have to keep fighting is because the police aren't doing anything. They are killing people.
[comment]I don't think we need to fight or riot. We need to keep fighting.
[comment]You know[comment]I'm a communist. I think the way you put it[comment]I agree with what you're saying.
[comment]You know the only way for the democrats to win is to kill each other
[comment]I think the hard way. There is no way to defeat a party that is so determined to destroy democracy.
[comment]I agree. 

You're absolutely right. The police are evil and will never be defeated by peaceful people
[comment]I'm not a communist and it's a way to justify killing people.  But I really don't think that “all cops are bad” is a good thing. 

And I would argue that the peaceful protestors are too busy protesting to notice that the rioters are both being killed.
[comment]I don't think that the way you phrased it in the first place is:
We have to keep fighting.
[comment]I don't think you should be defending police brutality.
[comment]I don't think that's the right way to frame it. 

We have to keep fighting.
