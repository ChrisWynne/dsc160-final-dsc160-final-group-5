After witnessing the heinous amount of police brutality in the US against POC, my partner and I have created some protest posters in response. We do not care about credit, just getting the message out there, so feel free to distribute however way you want, or make better versions yourself if you think it can be improved! Remember when youtube was just a site for the masses? Yeah, I kinda get it. What do you guys think? I'm gonna vote for Biden again, because he has the best VP performance of them all. I think I'll keep my vote in the blue or yellow, because Biden should be the worst VP ever.  I don't know about all the others, but I'm voting for Biden because I think he's the right candidate, because his team is so good, because he's got the policy blueprint that good, because he's done a wonderful job leading the country, because he's done a great job at being a Senator, because he's done a wonderful job as a President.  Vote for Biden because it's the only choice you have! Or vote in droves and let people down Biden isn't perfect.  But his VP performance is a huge plus.  And there are so many good VP candidates, he still has the VP lead in this close. And the fact that VP photo ops aren't usually posted online tells you quite a bit about Biden himself.  He needs to show he's tough, strong, and tough-minded enough to put up with the masks, the lies, and the sexism.  He's a tough, tough president who needs to bring some kind of backbone to the operation.

So yes, Biden is an idiot. 

But I would put the chance at 270 electoral votes in the red and he'd lose the popular vote by 3 million with a +3.4 million blowout. For my money, Biden is a superior candidate to Hillary Clinton who's polling at around +20.   And I still think he's a decent pick, but I'm not shaking my head no more than Biden's running mate, Tim Kaine. Klobach is a Russian thing ü§î and U.S. elites are the sameü§î We can't even create jobs in the USA without putting the interests

We do not care about credit, just getting the message out there, so feel free to distribute however way you want, or make better versions yourself if you think it can be improved! We also do not care about the image of officers abusing people, as long as it shows real officers who are standing up for what they believe in. We care about justice and compassion for those in need. The more the police abuse people in the streets, the more they want to kill police. The more people become violent towards police, the more people become violent towards police. The more people become violent towards police, the more violent the police become. The more the police abuse people in the streets, the more the violence rises, the more the officers abuse the people in the streets, the officers abuse the people in the streets.

We all know it doesn't.  

We're willing to accept the mental state of the individuals who commit these crimes. 

And the state that murders them like criminals do doesn't deserve a fair trial.

Idiots, you're the person. The person who screwed up. 

So, if the police officer isn't stepping down, then so be it. 

This is not a political statement. 

This is a fact. 
‚ÄúNo justice, no peace.‚Äù It‚Äôs a defining moment of mine. 
‚ÄúI am a proud American and I will never be a citizen of the United States of America. 

When you see how bad things are here in this country, you can't help but feel empathy.  Everyone has a responsibility to advocate, right? I guess if you wanted to ruin Ivanka's reputation and ultimately the president‚Äôs, you could. Just another day in politics. That‚Äôs what a coward you are. It‚Äôs a fairly certain thing, right? 

Trump is known to not listen to people‚Äô‚Äôs concerns. 

The police officers who murdered Philando Castile last year were Trump‚Äôs people. 

We are not demonstrating against Trump, but against the entire political system. 

It‚Äôs not just white people, we‚Äôre talking about people in cities and states as well. Downvote posts forever. Good idea, folks. 

I imagine that if he had been listening to the comments of the grieving police officer, he might have accepted the message. 

Unfortunately, while he was listening to mourners and the grieving community, he listened to a troll on Twitter. That troll, and the racist and inept tweets he received, are not reasons to not not vote. This is nothing new, but it‚Äôs

We want justice! And a solution that treats everyone equally and doesn't leave anyone behind.

Reasonable protest is fine, but we all have to accept that no matter how virtuous a protest is we have to go out and find better ways to show support. I would just like to point out that I salute everyone's willingness to stand up for what they believe in and embrace change. I would also like to point out that the leadership that we have seen is not just a few deplorables, but people who have absolutely no understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Funny thing is, we ended up with a messianic dictator who has absolutely no regard for human life. Yeah it‚Äôs a bit of a light bulb to my head. And yet, I don't completely despise anyone. I hate people who don't want to change and hate people in power who don't want to change but want to fight for it. Often those disagreements are just a matter of opinion...and if you don't like it, you can always just go for a walk or read a book. That said, eventually all of us will come to realize just how dumb things are and we will be okay. I honestly don't know what the hell I am doing here. I have no problem with Trump being President, I just don‚Äôt think trump is the right leader for the job. I don‚Äôt think that this administration is very good, at all. At this point, if you‚Äôre still holding out hope that he‚Äôs all right, just keep going and posting. It will help. It‚Äôs a start. We‚Äôll keep protesting until he‚Äôs all right. I don‚Äôt think it's going to be a laughing matter though, unless he somehow orders his totally unkillable Army to invade, and then all hell breaks lose...even if it kills hundreds of thousands of people. Do you see

I just want the public to know that justice is served.  This is a country that was hit by the worst financial crisis in decades.  There was no racial preference for wealth transfer. There was a racial preference for wealth transfer. And then there was racism. 

And then there was sexism. 

Now it's been proven that there is indeed equality between men and women. And that justice is not being served. 

We must begin to think about the lives we care about and how we can improve them. We have to start with the facts and not just pretend that justice is being served while also pretending that inequality is being rectified. It's time to start calling out those who are reducing opportunities and opportunities for people to be better for the wealth and power we have. 

Just go back and read the book while we all grieve. We have to start getting real about who we are as a people and *when* we want to get better. 

Here are some ideas I'd like to see implemented in Minneapolis on a national level to actually start implementing changes in Minneapolis:

First, improve access to information, including the statistics. 

Then, better testing of these tests, and a better oversight of tests being run.

If we want to see the progress we can make right now, I'm convinced that law enforcement and the police unions need to unite and demand that the tests and testing be abolished from the testing process. This is a common goal of both unions and police groups, and it's already being achieved. 

If we want to truly understand the real meaning of equality and for me, justice, I want to see the wealth of data that we have, including test results, that show that POC are doing more with less. This is the real meaning of equality. I understand that you feel that way and you sincerely disagree with me, but the bottom line is that what you're
