[comment]So why do you have to be a police officer to have a real problem? You're just saying that we need to think about what we can do in an emergency.
[comment]Saying "I want to" and "I want to" is not a police issue. Police can be involved in a lot of things. They are part of the police force
Just saying
[comment]I'm not a police officer[comment]Yes
[comment]That's a police issue. 

I don't have a problem with the police. I don't have a problem with them breaking up peaceful protests. I don't have a problem with the police giving too much attention to the fact that a lot of those people are peaceful protesters who aren't committing any crimes. I don't have a problem with the police either.
[comment]The criminal is the one that is going to find the police officer.
[comment]I agree with the statement - I see it as just saying that we are more likely to see the police taking over the situation than to arrest someone for a crime. That's more than I can ever put down to the police.

I also agree with the statement - I see it as just saying that we are more likely to see the police taking over the situation than to arrest someone for a crime. That's more than I can ever put down to the police.

[comment]So.. is there a time when you should have been saying things like:


"This is what happens when a police officer is involved in a riot and it doesn't have to do with the police[comment]I have a hard time believing you should be calling it a riot. It's the exact opposite of what happened when you were telling me to be quiet and not to bother.

[comment]Biden needs to resign. This is a criminal issue.
[comment]So you don't get to decide what may or may not happen.
[comment]I don't see it as a police issue.
[comment]I see it as saying that we need to think about what we can do in an emergency. I get that it isn't[comment]If you don't want the police to get involved[comment]I don't see it as a police issue.
[comment]I'm not sure[comment]The whole "I need to get out" line is a complete sham. It's not about the police. It's about the criminal

It's all about the criminal
[comment]To me that's a police issue.
[comment]I don't see it as a police issue.
[comment]I'm just saying[comment]I'm not sure[comment]I see it as saying that we need to consider what we can do in an emergency. I can't see it as a police issue. I just see it as saying "I want to"
[comment]Exactly.
[comment]I don't see it as a police issue.
[comment]I don't see it as a police issue.
[comment]I think it's a crime that the police officer is involved in the riot. 

My point is that I don't see it as a police issue.
[comment]It's just a crime.
[comment]I just read your posts. I understand the "police" sub isn't a crime.
[comment]I'm not sure[comment]I'm not sure

I know this is a long way off[comment]And hopefully she’ll get that job.
[comment]She's going to be on the Senate Judiciary Committee for the entire hearing.
[comment]I'm not an expert[comment]I think it would be a good thing if she was testifying in person. I think the judge should be next.
[comment]She's not going to be asked.
[comment]You can and should subpoena witnesses and you can tell the Senate to look away. But it's a good idea for the judiciary committee to be subpoenaed and the House to be subpoenaed.

[selftext]https://twitter.com/Pete_Fang/status/12345789122750095[comment]It's hard to compare people from different backgrounds. And I know that there is an element of privilege when it comes to this. But[comment]You can't compare people based on merit.
[comment]You can't compare people based on race.

You have to compare people based on their looks.
[comment]I think black people are inferior to whites.  I don't think I am inferior to white people.
[comment]Remember the day Pete was arrested for trashing the police for not having black police Chief?
[comment]It's easy to be racist and say "I don't like Pete Buttigieg. I think he's a moron." But we don't have the police chief we need.  I think we need a lot more than that.
[comment]The only difference is that Pete was arrested for trashing the police for not having black police Chief.  The police chief is white.
[comment]The only difference is that Pete is black.
[comment]I disagree. Pete had a great time and he should be held accountable for everything.
[comment]I think you can't compare a person of color based on their looks.
[comment]I think Pete has the right to say what he wants but his right to say it as a man who was arrested for trashing the police for not having black police Chief.
[comment]This is a bit of a 'What the fuck are you saying?

[comment]As a black man[comment]I love the fact that trump is a non-stop callous disregard of the constitution. I'm a conservative and I still don't like him. But one thing I really like is that trump is hiding the fact that he really is a nasty person. I recently read an article about how black people are more likely to be killed by police than white people[comment]It's not that he isn't a racist. I'm a moderate and I still don't get it.
[comment]I'm not sure how Trump is an actual racist. I think he would rather have these people arrested for a crime than have them arrested for something that they did not do.

I don't think this is what he's trying to do. 

He is a coward. 

He needs to be held accountable for the crime[comment]Trump has the most sexist and homophobic comments ever.
[comment]I'm an expert on this subject and I just want to say[comment]He was so good at it. I'm not sure what the problem is.
[comment]If it weren't for trump[comment]If it weren't for trump it would be a disaster
[comment]I've seen the video of Trump in action[comment]I just wanted to say that I have to agree with this. He is a shill for the rich and famous. I agree with the fact that he is very rich. He also has very rich friends. This guy just can't get enough of the rich. 

Not to mention his friends in the military.
[comment]He's a little bit of a bully.
[comment]I can't explain the insanity of this. The only question is how many of these people are fucking up the rules to allow trump to be a president. And that's assuming he can get through the election and keep his party in power. In a truly democratic country
[comment]The truth is out there. 

The GOP wants to make this nightmare a reality to be solved by the Obama administration and they don't care who is president.   Trump.
[comment]Why not just remove him from office?
[comment]He's racist. He's a shill for the rich.
[comment]He should be impeached.
[comment]Man I hope we find out who the new president of the United States is.

[comment]I wrote this for the subreddit because it is so relevant.

It talks about the police and their tactics and their response.  

It talks about how to respond
[comment]What if we had a police state?
[comment]I think it would be pretty useful to have a police union in the country. Most of us don't have them. They're the ones who use their status as police officers.
[comment]Yeah[comment]&gt;[comment]I thought the police union was actually one of the leaders of the protests that destroyed the party that was supposed to be the opposition
[comment]I'm not a police union member but I've been saying this for years now. The police union is the largest and most important organization in the country. The police union is responsible for policing the country in the right direction. This is why they are the police union.

[comment]So they're trying to shut down the protests and keep the police union?
[comment]We live in a state of collapse.

[comment]There were some Twitter users who thought it was a good idea to make the title "police violence" a bit longer and more specific.

[comment]Well[comment]This is the first time I've ever seen anyone actually say anything in response to a situation like this.
[comment]The problem with this sub is that it is so vitriolic. It's so easy to get offended when you're being caught. It's so easy to get attacked.
[comment]I think I've seen it on Twitter before. We just can't get back to it.
[comment]I've been warned
[comment]I've been warned[comment]It's not "police brutality"
[comment]The sub is obviously “really” wrong”
[comment]I don't want to be your enemy[comment]What about the republican republicans?
[comment]I love this sub and I've never been much of a republican. I think it's the only place that the republican party is organized and at all times in the modern American history.
[comment]I've never been a republican. I think it's the only place that the republican party is organized and at all times in the modern American history.
[comment]Why are the republicans so worried about this?
[comment]No one is talking about it.
[comment]I see this as a partisan sub. This is a partisan sub.
[comment]It's been a while.
[comment]I've been on the phone a lot lately. I have to say I just felt like there were a lot of people that were just trying to get off their asses.
[comment]I've always been a republican[comment]I only ever see this on the left[comment]Can we seriously not be the republicans that we were in 2015?
[comment]What's an issue with this?
[comment]I'm a democrat but I don't like this sub.
[comment]I've been on the phone a lot lately. I have to say I just felt like there were a lot of people that were just trying to get off their asses.
[comment]It’s about the right and the left.
[comment]Why is there a limit to how much you can yell at people?
[comment]This is a partisan sub
[comment]The reason I say it is because it’s about the right and the left
[comment]I just watched this last week. It’s a partisan sub.
[comment]I'm a democrat but I don't like this sub.
[comment]I mean I’ve watched it a couple times[comment]It may not be a partisan sub but I’m not sure it’s partisan either.
[comment]The right and the leftists are all just "So what? It’s about that stupid right wing right wing party that has always been what we were after.

[title]Kentucky 2020 Election 
[selftext]https://youtu.be/-mh-k9j9PEa[comment]Maybe we need to redraw the electoral map in 2020. 

[comment]This is the same problem we found in 2016.
[comment]Can we do that?
[comment]I wouldn't be surprised if we do it in 2020.
[comment]I am a Democrat
[comment]I'm a Republican
[comment]The president has no powers. 

He can do whatever he likes. 

We should redraw the electoral map to reflect the needs of the people. 

Maybe we can do that.
[comment]I voted for Trump in 2016 and I hope I will vote for Bernie in 2020.  

If we can do that[comment]What happens in the 2020 election?  

I'm pretty sure we'll have to redraw the maps in 2020.
[comment]Not sure[comment]I would hope

[comment]I think the best way to avoid being misunderstood is to be as factual as can be.
[comment]This is not a debate. It's just an explanation of the issues that arise.
[comment]Some people are already doing this.
[comment]Makes sense.
[comment]I haven't seen the original article[comment]Apparently the republicans are not the only ones who don't understand the issues.
[comment]I'm not a republican[comment]Not everyone understands the issues. The problem is that all those people are making a fundamental error. The real problem is that they don't understand the issues.
[comment]I appreciate that.
[comment]I see an enormous amount of talk on this subreddit about how the republicans aren't the real solution. They are just a convenient excuse to do whatever they are asked.
[comment]This party doesn't understand the issues. They are just trying to make their case.
[comment]What also makes this subreddit so useful is that it's not just "reddit". The less people have to go to the subreddit to find information[comment]Well[comment]Is there a reason he's on reddit?
[comment]I just want to let everyone know that the republican party doesn't understand the issues. They are just trying to make their case. If you're a republican[comment]What makes this subreddit so useful? Well[comment]This subreddit is not moderated by the party.
[comment]I think it is a good idea to essentially ban the republicans.
[comment]What the hell is wrong with this subreddit?
[comment]They should be banned. Nobody is allowed to troll or otherwise attack anyone[comment]How is this not "fake news"?
[comment]https://www.politico.com/story/op-ed/2020/05/30/trump-media-hires-a-media-center-with-an-outreach-center-for-independent-americans/[comment]I just want to make sure nobody gets hurt or in need of care for any reason. If you want to be president?
[comment]This is what the GOP is trying to do. They want you to be president.
[comment]This subreddit is just a tool for the GOP.
[comment]How could this be any different?
[comment]I just want to let everyone know that the republican party isn't the answer. As much as I want them to have the trump presidency[comment]I'm not a republican[comment]This is not a debate.
[comment]Is that why everyone is on the fence about this?
[comment]I want to make sure everyone has access to the internet. The internet is what gives republicans their power.

[comment]Is there any way we can actually curb it?
[comment]I hope so.   
[comment]What we have is a bunch of ignorant people trying to make this a political issue.  

They have no idea how to think or act or think or act.
[comment]They're not even human beings.
[comment]This is the number one reason why I think the Democratic party is doomed. 

Fuck them.
[comment]I think that the Democratic party is the most dangerous it can be. 

Let's face it[comment]The GOP will always have a good shot at winning the White House and that's why they want to keep it.
[comment]Well that's what strategists will tell you.
[comment]I wish I was a barber but when I started doing this I was like "I'm going to have to send those people out the door."
[comment]The GOP have never wanted to admit their error. They've always been afraid to admit it because they know they were wrong.

I think they are thinking that they can find a way to get rid of Vice President Biden so they can make the same mistake of not admitting it.
[comment]When Biden is gone[comment]I have to wonder if there's any hope of stopping this. 

I mean[comment]The Dems believe they're the best in the world and the Republicans believe they're the worst.
[comment]You can't have a Democratic Party that can't handle the reality that our party is losing.
[comment]It's OK that they are going to say the Democratic Party is corrupt. They think that's not the case.
[comment]Isn't it nice to see the Dems supporting Hillary Clinton.
[comment]Let's get this out of the way first.
[comment]But I am not a Democrat.
[comment]The party that deserves to be the nominee.
[comment]I hope this is the last straw.
[comment]I agree with ruling out the coronavirus.
[comment]The Democratic party is still a dangerous and dangerous entity.  They are a threat to our democracy.  Those of us who do not believe in democracy have to flee to another country.
[comment]I think they're gonna have to work with the Republicans[comment]I think they have no idea how to manage the situation.
[comment]I hope this is a wake up call.
[comment]This is why I'm torn about the GOP. They have no idea how to manage this.
[comment]I am a Democrat.
[comment]But I have to say[comment]Some would say that in a democracy you have an obligation to take any action necessary to protect the public.
[comment]I am a Democrat

[comment]I find it and I still find it funny how it is "funny" and "politically correct" to call a female candidate "Hillary" while using the same ad. I think it might be legal to use the title.
[comment]It should be legal to use "Hillary" in the title.

[comment]I think the reason police have to be put in jail is because there are literally thousands of drunk people who will not be convicted. If there were a single one of you that was convicted of a crime[comment]It's not the police that have to be put in prison. They have to be put in jail for the crimes they committed.
[comment]I think that the reason police have to be put in jail is because there are literally thousands of drunk people who will not be convicted.

[comment]The bad guys are the ones that have to be let out of the country.

The "bad guys" are those that are not even arrested for it.
[comment]I see a lot of people who are saying this and feel it's important to make sure the rapist or the murderer is even brought before a grand jury for the crime. 

In my opinion[comment]I feel like something to do with the police being there to bail out the white trash.
[comment]I've read a lot about police and how they are supposed to be there to help the innocent. But I can't find any citations that mention the police.
[comment]The "bad" guys are the ones who keep the suspect in jail and keep the crime from getting caught by the courts.
[comment]Goddamn[comment]The good guys are the ones who keep the suspect out of jail.

[comment]It's bad enough that they are the ones that arrest the people who don't want to remain in the country. But it's bad enough that they are the ones that bail out the crime[comment]The good guys are the ones who keep the suspect in jail.

[comment]The bad guys are the ones who wait until the suspect has already left before committing any crime to bail out the crime.
[comment]I have a few theories as to why

The arrest of the "bad" guys was a good idea because it prevents the "good" guys from committing some crime.

I'm surprised they haven't already.

It places the candidates on opposite sides of the argument.  

It brings up the issue of policing[comment]I think you can afford to keep people out.

You can keep people before the debate.

[comment]This is why we have the debates. The only issue is that the moderators control the debate.
[comment]I think this is going to be a bit more of a personal debate[comment]Trump has said he doesn't like to debate because he knows the moderators will lash out at him. So[comment]If we can make the debate a little less partisan[comment]Exactly. 

The moderators can be the enemy. 

They aren't going to hold it against you.  They're going to hold it against you.  And they're going to catch it. 

I think it's fair to say that Trump and the Republican Party are going to be the primary target of the debate.  So[comment]Well[comment]If you get a chance to get a chance to debate Trump[comment]So does this mean that Trump is going to "tweak" the moderators for them?  

This is all part of the primary. 
[comment]This is a campaign
This is also about Trump.
[comment]I can't believe it's coming from a man who has chosen to be in the White House.
[comment]You know what I agree with?
[comment]I think you should watch the debate.  It is a great way to get a better handle on some of the candidates and their positions.
[comment]I don't think it can be happen[comment]Well[comment]Look[comment]I also think it's fair to say that the moderators have a direct line to Trump's supporters.  I also think they can be trusted to not be too adversarial. 

I think they are.

[comment]Way to go.
[comment]Thanks.
[comment]The debate is an opportunity for the GOP to discredit Trump and try to make him look bad.  I hope it's good for the GOP and the country.
[comment]I always thought the GOP wanted a good debate.  I hope the GOP can find a way to have a good one. 

I don't think it's fair to say that the GOP have a direct line to Trump's supporters.  They have to get their way.

[comment]What a jerk.
[comment]I see this as a response to the recent rumblings.  

I don't think that's a good thing.
[comment]Nah[comment]I'm not being a jerk. 

I'm just saying[comment]I'm not seeing arguments here. 

This is what the fuck is the issue here. 

The argument is that the police aren't doing their job[comment]To think police violence is the problem.

[comment]I don't see this as a reaction at all.  It's more of a response to the police rioting at the Democratic National Convention. 

The solution is to have a campaign to make sure that all protesters don't have to buy into the narrative that the police are politicos. 

More than that[comment]Maybe they're just confused about the police.
[comment]I'm not a police professional[comment]I do understand that[comment]This is the right answer.
[comment]I don't see this as a reaction.
[comment]I'm not seeing this as a response. 

At best[comment]The problem is that the police have already decided that if they did nothing[comment]Meh[comment]The problem is that there are so many different responses to police violence. I don't think there's one that fits everyone.
[comment]I don't think that's a good thing.
[comment]The problem isn't that there are too many different responses to police violence. It's that there are so many different responses to police violence.
[comment]Fuck police.
[comment]Not exactly the worst response. Maybe[comment]I don't see this as a reaction. It's more of an issue of whether or not we have enough resources to respond to it.
[comment]The great thing about the police is that they aren't getting any help. Their response is completely random[comment]This is how it is.
[comment]I don't think I've ever seen a poster for a protest or a police report for a rioter.
[comment]I get that[comment]I don't see it as a reaction.
[comment]Why is this the case?
[comment]That's the thing. The police are the problem[comment]They don't have the resources to respond.
[comment]This is exactly what the police are doing.
[comment]I also don't see it as a reaction.
[comment]I give them two points
1. They do a solid job at policing[comment]This is a work in progress.
[comment]I don't think this is a response.

[title]Trump’s campaign isn’t getting any money from Congress.
[selftext]
[comment]This is what happens when money is given to a political party and then it’s not a political party.
[comment]I'll stop for a moment[comment]Trump has no problem with the stealing of political donations.
[comment]But the money going to the GOP[comment]He’s all for it. Nothing new here.
[comment]There's no point in using the funds to pay for things you disagree with.
[comment]But I think his campaign needs to search for a way to create a sense of urgency with their voters.
[comment]If they don't want the GOP to hold on[comment]I love how Trump's campaign seems to be ignoring this.  Yet they don't even bother to set up a video.  

It's an advertisement.  

They just give the ads their most basic ads. 

Instead of giving their ads their most basic ads
This is a great way to make money off of the entire Republican Party. 

This is why the GOP is dying[comment]How long until Dems show up[comment]Who is this guy to start a campaign with?
[comment]Trumpism is a thing.
[comment]Couldn’t be more obvious.

We don't need to be talking about this[comment]Oh wait[comment]He is the only candidate that has the balls to speak out on this.
[comment]I’d love to see a video of the candidate and his supporters.
[comment]I can tell you this[comment]So how about posting it to Facebook?
[comment]I’m always curious if Trump’s campaign is helping out with the ads.
[comment]Trump's supporters are a bunch of ****.
[comment]I don't think this is news to most people.
[comment]He's a idiot.

I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not.
[comment]I think the ads are a good way to get his supporters on his side.
[comment]Sheer poof!
[comment]People who don't like Trump are all being demeaning people who agree with him.
[comment]Can you tell me why?
[comment]If Trump can't stop the looting[comment]Make a video of the campaign and let me know what you think.

We need to find another campaign and then put a link to it on Facebook.
[comment]I have been saying this for the last couple of weeks
[comment]It's not news.

The problem with this is that there isn't a single candidate who can actually speak to the concerns of the vast majority of people.
[comment]I don't think Trump is a bad person. He just needs to be held accountable.
[comment]So[comment]How about putting his supporters on the line and asking them to help him out with ads.
[comment]Trump's supporters are a bunch of ****.
[comment]I don't think Trump's supporters are good people. I don't think he’s a good person.
[comment]He's a coward.
[comment]He's a coward.
[comment]I think he's a man of few words.
[comment]This is a bad thing.
[comment]He was literally saying "I'll take the money[comment]I mean[comment]I think people will see this as a threatening comment.
[comment]Trump is a genius.
[comment]This is a good thing.
[comment]I think it's very important for the GOP to recognize that there is a real problem with Trump.

[comment]I feel like I'm being unfair to Trump supporters.    
[comment]Funny how they help his supporters.
[comment]The GOP has been doing their best to suppress every Democratic protest. 

They’re trying to keep the Democratic base from being empowered to run to the left.
[comment]Did anyone criticize the Democratic base for being so toxic in 2016?
[comment]Wow[comment]Trump's terrible status as president is a direct response to the many Democratic protests.  

They constantly argue with each other. 

They always pretend to be independent.  
They always try to pretend to be radical.

They always try to exonerate themselves.

They always try to scare the shit out of each other. 

As a result[comment]This is just the tip of the iceberg

I think this is why we are seeing the GOP's take on debates and protests.

You don't do that unless you're just playing it on tv.

The problem isn't that the police are biased against black people. 
   

The problem is that there's been a systematic failure to investigate these cases.

I've seen other subreddits where you can't even call your local police department to make sure you are not wanted.

[comment]I think the fact that these are the words of some people is because they are considered illegal by the government.

[comment]Please. Don't try to convince us that it’s legal.
[comment]I think the problem is that the police state is so easy to get around and so easy to control that people are going to be arrested for actually having a say in who the cops are and what they're doing.

This is not a police issue. This is a coronavirus outbreak.
[comment]The police should be charged with an offense under the state law[comment]This is a hoax.
[comment]Is anyone else worried about the coronavirus?

[comment]If I had to guess
I don't think coronavirus is especially bad for the police.

[comment]I wonder if the police are not actually protesting the behavior of the police?
