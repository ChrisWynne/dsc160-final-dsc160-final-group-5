Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]The ‘claim’s are false.  You’ll see people saying we're going to save the planet if we don’t do everything in our power to mitigate the risks. The issue is that we have a long way to go. We’re just trying to get people to move out of the cities[comment]We are a nation of immigrants...
[comment]This’s the worst I've heard of Republicans
[comment]They’re scum.
[comment]How can’t we fit all the shit out of the same tweet?
[comment]I’m from Canada and I’m from California.
[comment]Someone saying ‘that’’ is wrong.
[comment]As a fellow citizen[comment]They're just claiming that we don’t need to be vigilant because we’re in an economic downturn. But they're not.
[comment]"We are a nation of immigrants...
[comment]And the Democrats are the ones that are the worst.
[comment]What?
[comment]I know this sounds crazy. But if it's true
We're doing this because we disagree with the way things are and because we do not want to defend the people. So we’re doing this because we're really pissed at the way things are and because we're scared it’s going to get worse.
[comment]We're not going to be surprised if the economy goes up. I am not in any way saying businesses will suffer. I am saying we’re not going to be surprised. We’re not going to be surprised.
[comment]Well if New York City is going to be hit the hardest[comment]I don't understand why people are so quick to dismiss the fact that the economy is actually recovering.

We’re actually getting bigger and bigger and bigger. We’re getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[comment]I've never seen this type of hatred and bigotry on a social media site.
[comment]I'm a Democrat so I’m not surprised but it’s stupid to think that the media doesn’t portray this. I’m actually surprised the media didn’t bury the fact that this is happening. I am a Republican so I'm not surprised either way.
[comment]This is just dumb. People are so stupid that they take the fact that the economy is actually recovering and panic and "look at the world again". I’ve got proof of that in my head.
[comment]I agree. But people only take that as a stepping stone to actually believing it...

This is worse than the pandemic. The democrat narrative is that there is no cure and we're simply suffering because of the lack of one.

As I have learned in my time here in the U.S., the reality is that there is no cure. The Trump administration has done nothing to change that fact.

It's simply a matter of time.

We can't let the public down. We cannot allow our government to be corrupted.

But we can all accept that our government has a responsibility to provide the best possible care for our fellow human beings and that it must be accountable to our citizens.

I'm tired of the left constantly repeating their falsehoods and trying to deflect from reality. They are no better than the media.

For all of the problems they claim to fix, I believe they have done a great job of covering everything up. It's the same way with major wars. Just as the media has done a great job covering up the worst wars in the past decade. I believe it's time to move on and focus on the real issues.

I am tired of the left constantly repeating their falsehoods and trying to deflect from reality. They are no better than the media.

I'm tired of the same old narratives about the left being the enemy of the people
They're the enemy of the people.

They're a bunch of whining morons who want to destroy the country.

They're not the enemy of the people.

I'm tired of the left constantly repeating their falsehoods and trying to deflect from reality. They're no better than the media.

[comment]I know many of you are going to think this is not shocking to watch. I know it's not surprising to see a president go on national TV and bash a nation that has reduced crime and attacks on individuals. But surely this isn't surprising to see the media take a page out of the US Constitution and declare that freedom of speech and religion are fundamental rights?
[comment]On one hand I am outraged and completely shocked that someone as crazy as Trump would do something so wrong. On the other hand I am deeply disappointed and outraged that Trump is being so quick to condemn the tragic and unspeakable crime of the Syrian government.

I am sick and tired of this constant hate being spewed by those who literally cannot comprehend the reality of this situation.
[comment]I'm not surprised.
[comment]I don't know why they are so surprised.
[comment]Illegal immigrants from Mexico who have been convicted of crimes and sent to prison are even more of a threat.
[comment]I hate to break the news to you but the US is becoming the worst country on earth for illegal immigrants.
[comment]I think that Congress should be able to pass a law to prevent the manipulation of the immigration numbers to divert funds to states that are already red-flagged.

You can't have it both ways[comment]I don't know if I agree with this or not but I am sick and tired of the endless stream of lies and ignorance from the left.
[comment]I understand that people can argue about ideology[comment]I think the media is so blinded to the fact that illegals are bad and this is purely political.
[comment]I agree that illegal immigrants coming to the US should be allowed to work and work legally and that the country is doing a great job at making sure that they are all legal. But I am also a big fan of the US Constitution. I love the idea of something that has a long tradition of republican thought and has some pretty great principles. So I think the media is just blind to the fact that people are turning in innocent people.
[comment]I don't understand why they are so shocked to see the media take a page out of the US Constitution and declare that the UN has abandoned them.
[comment]I am sick and tired of these people telling us we're not welcome.
[comment]In this country we have laws that allow people to immigrate legally but they are being denied access to care. They have no health care and there are no jobs.
[comment]I'm a big supporter of the UN but I've been here for 3 years now and I feel like I never got the chance to see them[comment]I want to see the WHO make it as transparent as possible so that we know what the actual science is.
[comment]I am sick and tired of this endless censorship of the left and the left's dirty tricks. We need to look at the actual facts and not just the partisan hacks who are spewing their lies against us.
[comment]I think it's just a coincidence that the media is covering this as if it is a serious issue rather than a purely political issue.
[comment]I'm sorry for the disgust with the media. I'm glad that this happens to people that I trust.

I hope the US government places an emphasis on the fact that the world is going to change by American immigration.
[comment]I am sick and tired of the endless media manipulation of the left and the left's dirty tricks. We should all remember that the right has a very hard time being a credible force.

I think the media and the mainstream media are even more interested in the good and the bad of this than the good and bad of the virus or the good and bad of the vaccine. You’ll be happy to hear that the media and the mainstream media both reinforce the disease. 

That said

I don’t think the media and mainstream media both reinforce the disease.  The world’s media are the same and so will the media and the mainstream media. 

I'm a libertarian but I don’t think it’s an absolute leap to say that the Left is evil.

[title]CNN Undercover Spokeswoman Says CNN Ex-Reps Were Undercover
[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-undercover-spokeswoman-shares-coincidence-of-collaboration-and-sniffing-out-cnn-censorship[comment]I'm not surprised CNN is under scrutiny. It's a disgrace that the media is covering things that they don't like no matter what people say. The fact that they are covering this makes me sick.

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]We can't allow this to happen again

It's time to not allow it to happen again.
[comment]I don't care what the reason is. This is clearly the wrong way to look at it.
[comment]This is about the global economy. You can't just sit around and watch the world burn in a state of crisis.
[comment]While I'm at it[comment]I agree with the statement that if you're a Republican[comment]I get that this should be a strictly economic issue. But to be the only one who sees the economic aspects of this is abhorrent. Why should democratic republicans be ignoring the economic side of the issue?
[comment]Great article. Yet a bunch of people that hate on this issue here in America are also trying to bash the other side of this issue on the basis of ignorance.
[comment]If my brother is wearing a respirator[comment]I love that this is a Republican issue. I'm not surprised they're so quick to demonize it.
[comment]The reply that I got is:

"We don't know what happened. We don't know the actual cause.  I don't think you can expect us to know something about politics after all.  But we told the world we were going to do this.  We are supposed to be our own experts and we are supposed to be accountable to the people.   And it's not a political issue, it's a practical one.   It's a social issue and not a political issue.   We can't pretend that it's a political issue and it's not.   It's not.

Our president is not a doctor and he's not a doctor. He's an executive and he's the president.  And he's not in charge of the economy.   And there's no president that's been in charge of the economy for six months.   And he's not in charge of the economy for a quarter of a century.   And he's not in charge of the economy for a decade.   And he's not in charge of the economy for a decade.

So people wonder why tragedy strikes when too many people are killed in the same way.
[comment]In my opinion
I'm not a huge fan of the idea of recovering from a virus but if the left forces people to think for themselves and considers that they should not have to live in fear of the virus they will both be in jail. 

And I don't think this is a partisan issue. I think that people in general should not accept the freemasons or the communists or the Nazis or even high society or any other group that is no different than the left. 

I don't want to know who the left is[comment]I don't personally like the fact that the left wants to have society back to normal.  The right is concerned about the fact that it is being treated like an adversary and that the good and the bad of society can and should be ignored.
[comment]Who is this hypocrite? I'm a republican and I voted in the right.
[comment]This is the left claiming that everything they say is true and all the other bullshit is true.
[comment]I am so confused by this.  The left is so strong and the right so weak that they can't stand each other and they can't stand each other.
[comment]I'm a republican and I voted for Trump. A) a republican who wasn't a racist and b) a Democrat who was a liar and didn't care about people or racism

I'm a democrat and I voted for Hillary. I'm a democrat who voted for Trump

[selftext]https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sharpe-limbaugh-mccarthy-thinks-about-trump-health-care-bill[comment]If Trump didn't have the guts to do that[comment]The bill would have prevented the government from covering up the fraud and abuse that Trump has been charged with.

The bill would have created a tax credit for state and local governments and would have allowed states to use the credit to pay for additional medical care and for the expanding Medicaid program.

The bill would also have reduced the federal deficit by $1.3 trillion over 10 years.

[comment]The only way to get rid of Trump's health care bill is to pass a health care bill that includes everything the president promised.

[comment]Nobody is denying that the economy and climate change are complex and are important issues. Democrats and Republicans are all equally right on the economics of these issues. But I think we all know that our economy is going to continue to grow and that the government has a responsibility to keep it going to make sure that the economy gets back to full employment. Even the economists that I know of have said that the economy can continue to grow at about 5x the pace that it has been at the beginning of the 20th century. My own opinion is that we need to look at economic and political issues in a different way. And that is why I think we need to have more of a balanced approach to economic policy.

But we are going to return to normal as soon as we get our food and water.

I know that a lot of people are happy and proud of being Americans.  But we need to do a better job with the federal government and the private sector. We need to be more consistent and accountable.

It's time to focus on the real issue: mass protests.
[comment]We need to stop trying to justify or justify acts of violence and instead focus on the real issue: how to move to a better environment for all citizens.
[comment]So the far right has rallied around a meme that says it's all about cops killing innocent people and a meme that says it's all about a lack of accountability. Why the endless shitstorm over these last few days?

It's time to consider the real issue: how to move forward.

[comment]Yeah we should have a universal health care system.
[comment]While we're on the subject[comment]Republicans have been saying for years that the United States is in a globalized health system since the last ice age. Conservatives have always been the largest enemy of the health care system.

The social order is in chaos. 

It's time to make the sick a right and not a privilege.
[comment]This is really disturbing. You are saying that people can be afraid to protest?

From what I can tell
[comment]I'm a healthy person and I don't see protests as a threat to the health of the human race. 

So many people have been protesting for a long time.

The fact that it's happening in one group or the other is scary.
[comment]I'm not sure what you mean by "peaceful protest"

I'm not surprised at all at all. It's a form of protest that kills the cause. It's not the same thing as "un-peaceful protest" because it's a form of protest.

What I don't understand is that if you don't protest[comment]What happened to the protesters?
[comment]I do think it's possible to ask people to protest peacefully but the real question is if you are going to protest peacefully.
[comment]But it's not the right to protest.
[comment]I think people should be able to protest peacefully. I don't think people should be forced to do so.
[comment]What is this about? Protesters protesting peacefully should be treated as criminals[comment]I don't know. People protesting peacefully for the right reason is not protesting for the right reason.
[comment]Yeah[comment]There is no right to protest. It's a right to protest.
[comment]I was worried about the protestors protesting a well thought out plan. I don't think that.
[comment]The goal is to silence and silence the protesters.
[comment]I think protesting is either called "soil strike" or "forget about the protesters."
[comment]I’m not entirely surprised.
[comment]I’m glad you're protesting peacefully
[comment]I’m not here to argue. I’m here to point fingers at the protestors and say that it’s not their fault. I'm here to tell you that it’s not your fault. It’s not your responsibility to voice your opinion in a way that doesn’t make people uncomfortable. It's your responsibility to take it seriously and to keep your voice to yourself.
[comment]What I really think is interesting about this is that the concept of "soil strike" is a huge source of tension in the conservative movement. It's not even a label for "soil strike" and it’s just a label to make people more aware of the protestors. I don't think that's the case. It's not such a complicated topic that you have to focus on the outcome. You can just as easily focus on the people that are protesting.
[comment]I think it's kind of a shame that we somehow think that the protestors are somehow "so bad" that they’re going to go out and protest every single time the state attacks the protestors. The protestors are protesting for their rights and the state is going to attack them for being protestors.
[comment]I think that the protestors are protesting violently for the right reason. The protestors are protesting to silence the protestors and to keep the protestors from making any attacks.
[comment]I don't know
[comment]What people in the left are protesting

[comment]And that was a Republican president last time?
[comment]I have a few thoughts.

First, I think the United States needs to start taking into account the fact that the world has changed dramatically since the end of the last great pandemic.

The global economy has recovered and the situation in the Middle East is much better. The inflation rate is not as high as we had thought.

The food supply has been depleted and there are fewer hungry people. I think the world is headed for a very bad time. It's the worst we've ever had in human history.

I don't think we should be surprised that many companies that manufacture and sell things need to be prepared for a future where the virus can kill thousands of people and humans can be infected. It's not a time to be surprised.

Second, I think we should take into consideration the fact that the virus that is currently circulating in the US and other developed countries is a giant threat to the global economy and to the survival of the entire human race. If we can't fathom how this could have been any different any other way in the future then what would the situation be?
[comment]I'm glad we have to take serious steps to protect the planet. The virus is a monster. We want to avoid it.
[comment]I'm not surprised that the United States has a death toll of over 2 million people[comment]I don't want to say he was right.  A couple of years ago he called for more stringent testing of the vaccine.  And then when he said he wanted to "look at it"
I think the fear is this is a movement in the right.  We have Americans who are severely mentally ill and we're all still a long ways away from the virus

We're all still suffering and the virus is still there. It's just a matter of time before it kills more people than it already has.
[comment]Good. I agree he was wrong about how we should handle the subject
[comment]I agree he was wrong about how we should handle the subject
[comment]Lol he doesn't even care about the fact that we're still the fucked up superpower and the world is finally waking up to the fact that we were never supposed to be like that.
[comment]I am not a scientist. I am a citizen. And while I am a citizen[comment]I'm a republicans voter
[comment]I think this is the first time anyone has had to refute a point for which the President has not publicly addressed the issue.
[comment]It's a shame that the world is still so far ahead of what we can expect. The world today is a farce and to pretend we don't have the right to have our own opinions is an act of cowardice.
[comment]I'm a democrat and I don't think we should be surprised that the virus is spreading all over the world.  The world is already being infected by the pandemic. And it's happening in a fast and furious fashion.
[comment]He's right in that this is a virus that is constantly on its way to spreading as it does.
[comment]I'm a Democrat as well and I don't think our government should be responsible for something as trivial as the virus spreading there. I'm sure this virus will not be the last. We need to take responsibility and we need to be vigilant about the virus.
[comment]I'm a Republican[comment]I don't think we should be surprised that the virus is spreading all over the world. It's not a time to be surprised
[comment]I'm a Republican but I don't think we should be surprised that the virus is spreading

[comment]It’s stupid to have so many people protesting.
[comment]Even though protests don't start with the white knight[comment]It’s ridiculous that there's so many people protesting in the streets. If you're protesting the police brutality that's going to be a riot and a rioting is going to be a riot.
[comment]I’m sick and tired of the left but they've got to be this stupid. It’s probably the only thing that can stop these people from actually protesting. It’s super heartening to hear that people are protesting.
[comment]The left have been doing this for decades. With the advent of the Internet[comment]I think it's perfectly legitimate that protestors should be protesting. Wait until the next time
[comment]It’s ridiculous that these people should be protesting.
[comment]I'm surprised we have so many people protesting in the streets.
[comment]I think the Left is doing their best to pretend people aren't protesting. They don’t know what they want and they don’t care about anyone else. They just want to protest. If everyone just wanted to protest and not protest and not protest they would do well. But this is the same people who are constantly protesting and protesting.
[comment]I am a Democrat from the South who lives in California. We have a different TV network than most other major cities. I got to go to a "conservative" party meet just to fill my cell. I’m the only person in the group I’m not a part of. I feel like the media is covering up for these people while they don't have to. I think the whole country is sick and tired of these people and just keep protesting.

I was a Democrat until the day I met my future husband and I had a disagreement on a topic. He asked me what I thought and I said the democrats are the worst. The guy kept saying that I was the worst. Then I looked at him and he said I was the worst...
[comment]I couldn't tell which side I was on. I'm not a Democrat[comment]I honestly don't know!
[comment]I'm a doctor and I have 1 patient and 1 nurse. I think I’m at the level of a ‘manager’ who is the most qualified to deal with this situation. I’m in my late 30s and I work in the private sector. I’m a ‘manager’ who also works for the DNC. The ‘manager’s should be the ones dealing with this. I’m a doctor and I’m a nurse.

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

The proof is in the numbers.

https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/10/coronavirus-gives-world-falling-power-in-south-korea/

And finally

This is a virus that is very hard to control. The only way to put a stop to it is to wait for a vaccination campaign.

The media is not covering up for the truth

Now let's look at the virus and see what we can take away.
[excerpt]
[https://www.livescience.com/2020/10/31/coronavirus-gives-world-falling-power-in-south-korea/]

The virus that is killing people now is killing people in South Korea.
[excerpt]

The people of South Korea have been protected from the virus for the last three years. They have been assured of everything they have been told.

They have been assured of a democratic government.

They have been assured of having a trump/Pelosi puppet in the White House.

The people of South Korea are living in fear and they are terrified that the trump/Pelosi puppet will take over.

The virus has killed a million people in the last few months.

The media has been covering this for years and the media are lying. The virus is being blamed on China which is not the main reason for the changes in the media

As I raved about the famine in South Korea
[excerpt]

The virus has killed a million people in South Korea[excerpt]

It is becoming more and more the same

It is trying to kill people.

It's trying to kill the democratic populace.

They believe it to be a hoax.

I didn't think this would happen. Because we've been indoctrinated to believe in the "good" side of things.
[comment]So I'm a doctor and I don't think Coronavirus is bad. I just don't think it's a huge deal to say we can't do it[comment]I'm not saying we should be hesitant to try and stop people. We should be vigilant about not just people just being black or white but anyone who has actually been outed or passed "hotline" abuse.

But there's no way to know that nobody that I know is ever intentionally exposed to the virus. It's not even a reasonable assumption that people should be hesitant to go out and protest as much as they'd like.

[comment]It’s not like we’re all just buying into one ideology. We all know the opposite of the truth.
[comment]I wonder how many of us are even aware of the fact that the police brutality rates are so high that it’s hard to monitor and report.
[comment]When do we finally get to see the bare truth? When we finally get to see the real truth?
[comment]We all know that the opposite of the truth
[comment]Maybe I'm being a little biased but our government projects a horrible record of people being killed. We also know that there has been a disproportionate amount of crime in the country over the last decade. 

We also know that we have an enormous amount of violence against black people. 

We also know that many of us are unarmed. 

We also know that our police departments are not efficient and ineffective. 

We also know that it’s not just African Americans that are suffering. 

We also know that the police have been ineffective and corrupt for decades. 

Much like we have never been more vigilant than now.
[comment]I hope the world is waking up to the fact that the government isn't doing anything to improve the lives of its citizens.
[comment]I wish I could’ve never met the man who is responsible for the deaths of people in police custody. I would love to know how he got there[comment]I am irate and shocked by the amount of hate being spewed.
[comment]It’s not just black people that are suffering.
[comment]I don’t know how this can be called a major issue.  I think Trump’s office should actually investigate the deaths of unarmed black people.
[comment]Its not just black people that are suffering. I think the president should investigate the deaths of unarmed black people.
[comment]The fact that people are actually doing what they're supposed to do is shameful.
[comment]in the end it is all because of white people who don’t care about black people.
[comment]I think that's a good thing.
[comment]You know why in the world we have this??
[comment]At least the left is doing something about it.
[comment]I'm not a big fan of the police killing of black people. But they should be prosecuted for killing people of color. The police should be jailed for life.
[comment]I am sorry to hear about the death of George Floyd. He was a quiet guy who didn't give a shit about the police. He was a quiet guy who frequently watched the news and would make sure to call for help when he went outside. George was a good man and a good person in every way.

[comment]I think this is the sort of thing that can be done in a democratic country.

I think it's been done in the US and the UK and Australia.

I think it's been done in countries that have never had a serious crisis like China.

I think it's important to remember that we can't just accept the fact that the world is at a point where we can't control it.

We need to recognize that the only way out of this crisis is to give people the resources they need at the end of the day.

So I think if we move forward as a nation we can significantly make the world more peaceful and less dangerous.

[comment]I think this story is way too sensational. Let me just tell you: the world needs to know how terrible the virus is.

There are a million reasons why we should make the decision to leave the world. There are a million reasons why we should not leave the world.

But most of the reasons we have to make the decision to move are justifications for the current level of suffering and lack of economic opportunity.

And the world needs to get used to the reality as it unfolds.

This is why I bought into the conspiracy theories that the West has been suffering from global warming for too long.

Because I think any institution that has the power to make an accusation of a supposed threat of global warming should be held accountable for making a false accusation.

I think the Trump administration should be held accountable for their actions and the fact that they are not held accountable is not a good thing.

We must move from a climate system that has been looking at us for over a century to one that is finally fixing the problem.

There is no denying the severity of the problem and the fact that we are now living in a situation where we have to deal with it one way or another.

This is not the time for excuses[comment]I feel like the media and the politicians are the ones that are blaming the virus on a China/Russia conflict that has escalated into a war. It's not the Chinese/Russian conflict that's been blamed on the virus. It's the fact that the media and the politicians are blaming the virus on a major attack that may have weakened the Chinese government/coronavirus.

This is the same media that is blaming the Chinese government/coronavirus on the Chinese mainland.

This is the same media that has blamed the US for not doing enough to prevent the spread of pandemic killers.

This is the same media that has blamed the Chinese government for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus.

Obviously these are fake news
The Chinese government/coronavirus is a major issue for the US and the world.

This is the same media that has blamed the US for not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus.

I can't believe the amount of attention we have received in the wake of the US presidential election.

We've seen a lot of fake news over the last few months.

I think the media should be held accountable for the fact that everything they do is fake.

We should be ashamed of ourselves[comment]It's not the media at all.
[comment]I'm not surprised at all[comment]It's not the media at all. Trump is a traitor.
[comment]I can't wait for the virus to return. Facts are just a distraction

[comment]We're going to have to deal with republicans and republicans cannot be trusted to do their job.  They're the ones that can't and we need to deal with them as a country.
[comment]Citizens United aside[comment]Imagine the outrage if the line of dems were to say that the Democrats are the only ones that can do our jobs. Because it's not possible to just sit in a room and pretend that everyone else is doing the same thing.
[comment]It's actually a pretty good argument. But the left will quickly understand that a president cannot be trusted to do his job as president.
[comment]I'm not sure that the media is especially so concerned about the negative fallout from the Coronavirus and the media being more concerned about the positive ones.
[comment]I would argue that the media is a very powerful weapon to influence every aspect of our politics and government. It's not a bad thing to have a mob of people trying to influence a president. It's a thing to do.
[comment]I feel the same way about the media.
[comment]I think the media should be allowed to be as partisan as they like.
[comment]If you disagree with the media's statements and opinions you are not a political person.
[comment]And the entirety of the media should be dissolved.
[comment]If the left wins the people over to the right
[comment]I never thought it would be so hard to elect a president who is wholly responsible for the state of the country.
[comment]I don't think the left is the only one that's done a hell of a lot to help the economy.
[comment]I love how the media is covering up what's really happening in the world.
[comment]What the hell is wrong with that?
[comment]I don't think the media is trying to be partisan. They're all trying to get their issues covered. They're all trying to get the government to do as they please.
[comment]I was on a senate committee as a Republican and I was accused of being a communist. It made me cringe. I didn't know what to think. I was shocked to see what was going through my mind. I am glad this is finally being said and it is saying something.
[comment]I don't care who is in charge. I don't care if we have a constitutional amendment or not.  It's the media that's doing the talking and the media that's doing the statements and everything else. It's not the state and the federal governments that are doing the talking and don't do the statements and everything else.
[comment]I don't know about you but I love the Left. I am a Democrat and I am also a Democrat and I was a republican. I voted for Bernie Sanders. I like the way he is doing things. I am a centrist and I am also a centrist. I know that the media doesn't care about the Democrat party and just as Republicans don't care about the Democrat party they just don't care about it.
[comment]I love how the media is covering up what's really happening in the world.
[comment]I think we need to move to a more democrat world.
[comment]I know Bernie is a little extreme but I am a Democrat and I am a Democrat. I am a Democrat and I was a republican before Bernie Sanders. I voted

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

The problem is that the left are now having to explain to the masses "why everyone should be required to wear a body camera"
[comment]We have to talk about the entire planet. We have to talk about the riots and the fact that some people have died and we've been told we have to "see the light".
[comment]The media is the media.
[comment]I don't get why the media would hide our outrage. We all know they hate us and we all know they hate them. I just don't get why they would completely ignore our outrage. I don't get why they would dismiss our outrage and blame every single one of them. I just don't get why the media would hide our outrage. I don't get why they would completely ignore our outrage and blame every single one of them.
[comment]I get the logic of a politician protesting and then saying ‘the whole world should be protesting and mourning ‘when all the people protesting are mourning.”
[comment]I disagree with the blame. If it was a movement to protest and then work on lowering the inequality of all of society then we would all be protesting about that.

But the hypocrisy of the media is astounding. When they lie about inane events they can't be blamed. It's the media that's lying about and the lying media that's the problem.
[comment]I don't know why we would be outraged over the fact that violent protests are happening everywhere and the media is covering it up because they are all being ignored and the people are not being listened to.

They have a responsibility to the whole world and I don't think anyone should feel that way. It's not like we have riots or riots in the US anymore. There are riots in cities and riots in the UK. Unfortunately

I think people should be held to their own standards and that's what we've all been doing. This is the right thing to do and it's a principle of our country. People are not stupid. No one is writing off our protest.

I don't think there is a single organization that has not been very vocal about this issue and it's a shame. We have been protesting and protesting for a long time now and we're never going to forget that. We have to stand up for our rights and not be silenced.

[comment]I'm sure she is going to win.
[comment]I'd rather see her as president than a democrat. I think she is more qualified and I think she's more qualified. 

But I'm a state senator and I've seen a lot of people who have run for office and I’m tired of the usual suspects who accuse people of being a bunch of whores and they should be ashamed of themselves. 

I would rather see her as president than a democrat. 
It's not that she’s not qualified. Her economic policies are crap

[comment]I don't think we all remember the horrors of the Vietnam War.
[comment]This is the most painful thing I've ever read.
[comment]I'm glad we can get to the truth and not the political theater.
[comment]I can't believe people are so focused on trump trump and the American people.
[comment]I think the media should have charged with covering up the truth and showing the kind of "classy" reporting it is.  If it wasn't for the fact that a number of the people who were charged with the crime aren't like me.
[comment]I don't want to make the case that trump trump is a criminal. I think this is just a convenient distraction from the actual crime.  The crime was a political term. The politicization of the crime is also a distraction.
[comment]Personally I don't think this is a scandal. I think trump trump and the American people deserve better than this.
[comment]It’s laughable how ignorant Americans are.
[comment]I will never forget how the first time I saw a video of a protester protesting Donald Trump being doubled-eyed and completely mentally ill. The video was taken in Trump Tower and shows him being removed from the stage by a giant security camera.
[comment]I’m definitely going to be watching the people riot against Trump. I’m definitely watching the people are going to get their power back. And I'm definitely going to be following my friends on social media to make sure they know what's going on.
[comment]I'm a total recluse and a huge Trump fan. I watched a few of the protesters get roughed up and get punched and kicked. That was a shitload of shit. I love the guy.
[comment]This is terrifying. I don't know what the hell the fuck is going on. It’s shocking how in the media it’s not news. I’m not saying this is a scandal[comment]I’m surprised this is a mainstream news outlet. But I’m glad the media did their job and had a proper investigation into the event. This is really troubling and I hope the people responsible for covering up this have the courage to stand up for themselves.
[comment]Is there a story here that you think is more relevant?

I’m not surprised it’s being called a genocide. 

I can understand some people who would consider themselves savages and want to be immune to the virus while others who are media critics are just a bunch of anti-Semites who craves to be seen as a being of some sort of god. 

I agree that the virus could have been prevented. 

However I am also not sure that this is a group that needs to be silenced. 

The virus simply is not preventing people from being susceptible to it. 

It’s also not a problem that it can't be prevented and it’s not even a problem that it cannot be prevented. 

It’s a virus that has a lot of people that need to be infected with it. 

I am not a doctor and I don't know what the symptoms are for a person who has it. 

I am a doctor and I am a huge fan of the idea of picking the most lethal virus to be prevented from being used for many years to come. 

I don't get that it’s a genocide because we don’t know that it is a virus that can be prevented
I don't know if it’s a genocide because it’s not such a serious issue since it’s a virus that can be prevented

I don't know if it's a genocide because it’s not so serious and the virus doesn’t have to be prevented.

The governor was asked about the Texas economy on this site and said it's not a "syndicate of the state" to help the poor. It's a "syndicate of the state". The fact that he's talking about it and not a "syndicate of the state" is a distraction is a little disappointing.

[comment]I’m so sick of the media cropping up to abuse the media. We can’t let a bunch of freaking mouthpieces keep telling us it’s okay to protest.
[comment]We're still so blinded by the fact that these protests are being taken literally. When we agree with one thing or another it's not when we stand up to people we disagree with.


Now that's not to say we shouldn't be critical of what's happening. When we disagree with one thing or another: we should just do it. It's not like we can always simply say "hey we’re not going to shut down the government for the sake of the economy."
[comment]I'm not saying we should do this or that. But we can’t ignore the fact that protests have been happening for decades now and we shouldn't be surprised that they happen in places that have already been shut down.

I am saying that we should. We can't ignore the fact that these protests aren’t illegal. We can't ignore the fact that the protests don’t just happen on a daily basis. They happen in places where there's already been protests.

[comment]I'm glad we had the possibility to go outside and see our loved ones when they get home.
[comment]I'm not surprised by the lack of awareness. You can tell that people are protesting peacefully. But you can't tell people that protestors are going to go out and kill people or that they're going to go to jail.

[comment]I support the president. But I also don't think the protests are justified. While there's some real harm done by people protesting on the streets.
[comment]I'm an older democrat and I'm so glad I joined the Republican Party. I don't know that many people who I respect what they’re protesting because they’re conservatives. But I think it is a whole other world to be in. I don't want to be a part of it.

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.

[comment]When the media are so opposed to it they're a threat to the democratic system.
[comment]I'm sure there are a million different ways to take your point.
[comment]It's not like Democrats don't want to use it to block the President from doing what they want.

You can't just ignore it and pretend that it isn't happening.
[comment]There's a real debate about the nature of the virus. The virus is a hoax. You can't just not use it to silence the protestors.
[comment]Well I'm not surprised. The media just doesn't care about the fact that it exists. They just don't care about the fact that Trump didn't do a damn thing. The MSM is only interested in the fact that they can portray everyone as a threat to the US and the world.
[comment]I think it's time to admit that the media really is the enemy of the people. They don't want to hear about the fact that the government is doing nothing to stop it. They just want to make sure that the people who are affected are taken care of and that the government doesn't get involved in the epidemic.

The media is probably the enemy because they have the power and the power to tell you what to believe.

[subtitle] 'Keeping the economy running'
[selftext]https://www.breitbart.com/news/2020/05/05/washington-dems-biden-letter-about-decision-to-reopen-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after-opening-seasons-after/[comment]No wonder the Dems are so obsessed with keeping the economy running. Our economies are in a tizzy right now. The economy is in a tailspin.
[comment]I get the Dems' real goal is to keep the economy running and win back the White House. They have proved that. I actually think that the economy has shot up in recent months and it's time to get back to being a country that can afford to run for president.
[comment]Dems are the ones who are the most accountable to the American people.  The fact that the Dems can go back to the way they were when they decided to reopen the economy is a sign of their own lack of accountability.

Liberals and liberals are the worst.
[comment]I'm a Democrat who voted for Obama in 2008 and I live in a republic. It is one of the great privileges of being in the United States. I'm a democrat.  I was elected because I think the economy was a great thing for the United States. 

My dad came to the United States in the 1950s and I was a teenager. I learned a lot from my dad and his policies.

The economy was great for all Americans and I got to enjoy the wealth I had enjoyed in the past decade.

The reason I am pro-business is because I don't believe in the extra taxes that are being paid by the government.  I believe in all the tax relief the government has given the American people. 

I think it's time to move to the states to get rid of the Federal government and to get rid of corporations and the state government. I believe in the idea of continuing to have a federal government that operates like a business. I am a socialist and I believe in a two party system and having a 2 party system.

I am also a democrat because I believe that government should be run free of government meddling. I am a Democrat because I believe in the importance of individual freedoms and I believe that when you have the government out of your life you will have the freedom to do as you please.
[comment]I'm a Democrat because the economy is great and I believe in free trade and the environment. I don't believe in government interference. I believe that the federal government should have a lower interest rate and that everyone should have health care. I'm a Republican because I believe that government should have a monopoly to make every thing that is done. I believe that we should not have a two party system because the political system is corrupted and the people run the federal government.
[comment]I'm not a republican. I think that the US is a much more democratic country than it had been before the economy. I'm a republican because I believe that politics should be run by a man or woman of the people.
[comment]I'm a libertarian because I believe in the idea of a free market and they should have a government that makes the government run the economy. I am a libertarian because I believe that the Federal government should have a lower tax

[selftext]https://i.redd.it/pskxqgtpw41.jpg[comment]Lol[comment]This is pathetic.
[comment]I don't know who to blame.
[comment]Polls don't ask how many people have recently died. How many people have been hospitalized. It's not a question of fact. No. It's a question of how many people have died over the last 40 years. How many have been in hospitals or with other mental health problems. How many have had mental illnesses.

Just a reminder to all of us to keep our heads above water. We're gonna die.
[comment]I feel like they're all happy to have a few deaths and not all of us are making excuses. I don't care who's dying[comment]The world is creating you are a horrible person.
[comment]😘
[comment]I'm not saying everyone are bad
I'm saying we should have some empathy for the situation.
[comment]I agree.
[comment]I feel like we're living in a post-apocalyptic world...
[comment]I kinda get why people are calling for this though. It's just people are so stupid and so out of touch to this world.
[comment]I'm a conservative. I don't think the Republican party is doing anything to change the fact that we live in this fucked up and fucked up world.
[comment]There are more of us in this world than there are of you.
[comment]I think it's safe to say that we're in this together.
[comment]I love this country. Where I grew up I'm proud of where we are. And I'm proud to be a Republican. I love where I live. I love the people here from the south.
[comment]I love how these people are just screaming and screaming and screaming and screaming and screaming. I hate to see them cry and groan and groan and cry because they don't know how to move.
[comment]Let's not forget this is a Republican Party.
[comment]This is not a group that is supporting Trump.
[comment]I live in Florida. I live in the south.
[comment]I'm a Republican
[comment]I'm honestly confused how people are so quick to dismiss the virus as a "fringe" movement.   Regardless of what the symptoms are[comment]I think this is a hoax. It's a mental illness[comment]No[comment]I'm a liberal. I'm a person that supports Trump but I'm not a Republican. I'm a college student that's a former member of the KKK and can't remember the last time I voted. I'm not a Democrat but I am a Republican and I'm a Democrat. So that's my political identity. I'm not a Republican. I'm a conservative that supports Trump but I'm not a Republican. I'm a centrist that supports Trump and I'll never vote for him. I'm not a Republican. I'm a little guy and I don't have a problem with the president. I'm a Democrat.
[comment]I voted for Trump
[comment]I was a Republican in high school and I'm a Republican at the same time. I'm a socialist. I voted for Trump. I respect Trump for being honest and saying he's in the right. I respect him having to explain to people exactly what he's doing and why. I like Trump and I like his policies. I don't think he should be running the country. He's doing the tests and trying to get people to vote. He's doing what he can to help people in need.

[comment]It's sad how much we don't understand that people in power don't care about the poor. They care about economic justice. They care about the wellbeing of the planet. They care about the wellbeing of their own people.

It's sad that so many people in power don't care about the poor. They care about economic justice. They care about the wellbeing of their own people.

They're not stupid. They're not stupid people.
[comment]I would predict the same thing with the virus in the UK[comment]There's a lot more to make of this than the Left's usual love of austerity and the dangerousness of government spending. But it sure is a shock to me that so many people are so blinded by the proximate cause of the pandemic to consider the pandemic a "real" threat.
[comment]I'm not saying that this is a bad thing. It's a crisis. A virus that can be fixed in a matter of days. The only thing it is doing is delaying the process. It's a virus that's being blamed for everything.

But[comment]I don't think we should be surprised at all.
[comment]The Left has lost their minds

[comment]I'm sorry
[comment]You really expect that the left will be stupid to let this happen. I don't get it. These pandemics are real and I'm not here to help fool them. They are real and I am not here to blame.
[comment]I think the Left is blinded by the idea that they don't care about the poor and that they are all stupid. I think they are blind. They are all delusional.
[comment]I think immigration is a real issue. The problem is that most countries have and have always had an immigration problem. China has a good immigration policy. The problem is the issue that China is a superpower and that the Chinese people are the ones that are now being pushed to move to the left. I don't think that the American people should be surprised. They know that the Chinese people are the ones that are being pushed to move up the political spectrum.
[comment]There's a lot of good reasons why immigration should be a big issue. I have no reason to think that the Chinese people are the only ones that are being pushed to move right. I think that the Chinese people are probably the most intelligent people in the world. They are probably the most intelligent people in the world and I think that they are the most intelligent people in the world. China is the best country in the world and I think that they are the most intelligent people in the world. I don't think that the Chinese people are the only ones that are being pushed to move left. I think that they are the least intelligent people in the world. I think that they are the most intelligent people in the world. I think that they are the least intelligent people in the world. I think that they are the least intelligent people in the world. I don't think that we should be surprised at all. The Chinese people are a great nation and I don't think that immigration and trade should be taken as seriously as I think they should be. I don't think that we should be surprised at all. We should find ways to do better than they do in the past. We have to deal with them and deal with them better than they are. I think that the Chinese people only have so many friends and I think that they have so many problems that they can't handle them alone and I think that they have so many problems that they can't handle alone and I think that they have so many problems that they can't handle alone and I think that they have so many problems that they can't handle alone.

[selftext]https://www.freep.com/2020/03/22/did-world-know-about-coronavirus-decided-to-stay-out-and-open-to-everyone-for-every-day/[comment]Liberals and liberals cannot in real life coexist. 

If you think about it

The only thing that changed in the last 2 years has been the influx of new people and a surge in business.  The economy has not recovered to its peak. The economy has barely recovered from the recession.  The stock market has not recovered from the recession.  It is hard to imagine the economy recovering from the economic crisis. 

There are more people in the world in jobs than there are jobs.  The economy has recovered and the wages have not gone up.  If the economy hadn't recovered we wouldn't have the years of crippling economic downturns we have today. 

I don't know what the average American would think now.
[comment]What a revelation.  I want to think a little more about this.  Coronavirus was a public health crisis and it's a privately run virus and I haven't been able to get a handle on how it's become a public health problem. 

It's a virus that has been around for a while and I don't think it's a public health problem. 

It doesn't feel like a public health problem and I don't think there's a big risk to be taken into account. 

I just don't know what everyone is thinking.
[comment]I'm surprised that Republicans are even interested in this.  Even with all the drama and panic that's come out of the Democrats' campaign and all the drama and distraction from the riots and what has transpired in the last week[comment]There are no predictions for it.
[comment]I'd love to see Coronavirus be the focus of a political debate. A lot of people are all thinking it's possible[comment]Carry on the good work
[comment]I'm surprised that Republicans are even interested in this. I think they're all scared of Trump.  They've all been out there and you can't believe other people are still so subservient.
[comment]Because everyone is a freak and they're so stupid
[comment]I don't know what the average American would think now. How could they be any more ignorant than the rest of us?
[comment]I can't imagine a rational person being surprised that a thing like this could happen in the first place.

[comment]It's too many to list here.
[comment]The Democrats are doing it too early. 

They are not fixing the economic problem. They are doing it to make the economy less dependent on government. 

It's just a rhetorical dodge.

[selftext]https://www.redstate.com/Y/V/100D9D2C/[comment]I'm being sarcastic. Because I don't think Coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's a global health crisis that affects everyone: the rich, corporations and the largest corporations.

I am not suggesting that we all take our country's healthcare system seriously. I am suggesting that we all take action to prevent and combat global health crises.

[comment]Why do we have the global leadership to do something for the planet
[comment]This entire article should be a no brainer.

[comment]The US isn't the only country in the world that has been hit hard by global warming.
[comment]I do not think this is a response by the US government to the crisis. The only reason that the US government is doing this is because they are worried about the spread of this virus. 

There are already a few deadly outbreaks in the US[comment]I'm not saying it's the US government that should be enforcing the law. Because if they do[comment]It's the left that wants to destroy the planet.

[comment]I don't feel the need to dwell on it. We're not a country that has to deal with a lot of these sorts of things.

Did the world forget about Coronavirus?

[subtext]
Since when were gatherings of more than 50 people allowed? Wasn't everyone in the mainstream media condemning states that even thought about reopening just two weeks ago? Politicians not wanting to sacrifice even one life in exchange for the economy?

Weren't reopening protestors made the laughing stock and the butt of everyone's joke, being labelled as a danger to everyone around them? Now we're multiplying those #s in enormous fashion, with thousands of people crowded and shouting together.

How quickly the tune changes when agendas align. This just blatantly lays bare to me the hypocrisy of politicians and media moguls who hold no principle dear. We now even have medical experts saying it's perfectly OK to go out and protest, so long as it's for this cause.

Could anyone enlighten me as to why this isn't just a blatant, transparent display of hypocrisy?

Note: I fully support policy changes that will reduce police brutality, and justice for George Floyd. But I also can't ignore how quickly we've all just pulled a full 180 on our own principles and standards.
[comment]Isn't it interesting that so many of the media outlets that are even now calling for a boycott of Coronavirus were also praising the Republican Party for not being so far left on this issue?
[comment]“the Democrats don’t care about the poor”
[comment]It’s crazy to think that the Republicans are so far left on this. They have literally been laughed at for decades.  They are the ones that always stand up for the downtrodden and don't give a shit about the working class.  They don’t have the political will to teach us anything.  They are the ones that always say the only thing that can stop the economic meltdown is for all of us to move to the middle class and have access to healthcare. 

If you disagree with them you are a political lunatics.  The left is not the party of ideas.  The party of ideas is the party of destruction. 

They don’t care about the poor. They care about keeping the economy going. They are tired of being left behind and the only way they can end this is to start over from scratch.

The only way to end this is to get out of politics and do something else. 

While I don’t agree with the idea of a universal health care plan or the idea of a health insurance system that would help the poor but that would also help the rich then that's not the issue.  

I don’t plan to be a Democrat for a while. I mean[comment]I think the Democrats are too left wing and too concerned with economic issues. They lightened the load on the middle class because they say so[comment]I think the Democrats are too left wing and too concerned with economic issues. They lightened the load on the middle class because they say so
[comment]I'm not sure how any party can be the enemy of a person.
[comment]Can we just move to the left now? 

The left wants to keep the economy as it currently exists.
[comment]Is it really that hard to keep the economy going when all the money going to welfare is used to support the rich and the rest to support the working class? 

I don't get all the hypocrisy that people are turning a blind eye to this.  

It’s a real issue for a lot of people.
[comment]I don't think this is the leftist thing to do[comment]I know this isn't a liberal issue[comment]I don't think this is the leftist thing to do[comment]I don't understand why people are so eager to move to the right. It’s a huge change for the economy and for the world.  It makes a lot of sense to me.

[comment]If you think this is a cliche[comment]How many of you think that we should have an emergency set up?
[comment]This “we’re” to blame for the crisis”.

Unless you've never been to a crisis and they’re all right feeds your brain.
[comment]It’s like “we’ll” be at the center of the riots if we’re not there to keep us safe.”

[comment]I don’t think there is a thing called a "disaster" in the right.

Same with the economy.
[comment]This is the difference.

I’m not an expert on politics but I think that this virus is all a hoax.

The virus is not a crisis. It's something we have to deal with.

I don't think there is a crisis. I think we are going to have a very different economy from the one that we have in the past.

It’s not about saving lives but saving money. Do you think we’re going to have a more successful economy in the future?

I think now is the time to do as much research and investigation into economics and politics as possible. I think this is a big issue with the media. They are not going to be the only ones to report on this[comment]So there's been a governor saying we must find a way to fix the economy but we're stuck on the debt? I think we need to look at some options.
[comment]I don’t know how the media are ignoring this
[comment]I don’t think the economy is going to be better than the one we currently have.

[comment]I dont know who[comment]I think it's time to stop talking about it.  The media isn’t interested in talking about it.  They are focused on their own agendas.  They are willing to talk about the way they want to talk about our own government and what they want to talk about.  It’s not the government that is about to tell them to shut up or to tell them to buy more guns. 

Also they are not interested in talking about how the Democrats and the media are doing a good job of bringing these events to light.  The media is doing a great job.  It’s not the democrats or the media that are the problems.  They are the problem and they are the solution.  They are the reason we have the healthcare crisis. 

I don’t care what your politics or beliefs are[comment]I know this sounds like a liberal class war cry and I find myself annoyed by it. But[comment]I know all of you are talking about the idea that the Democratic party is corrupt.  I’m not even sure the Democrat party has been corrupted.  I’m not even sure the Republican party has been corrupt.  I’m just not sure what we are talking about. 

I can only hope that we get past the hysteria and the hypocrisy of the left.
[comment]I don’t think we should be passing laws to make it illegal to hold people accountable for crimes they did not commit or pretend to do.
[comment]I'm an adult and I hope you’re aware that the Democrats aren't actually corrupt.  They are just a bunch of hypocrites who are trying to show that they are actually the ones who are the corrupt ones.

[comment]As a kid[comment]you wanna hear the story of the child being raped?
[comment]In the end[comment]The real irony is that this was all happening in the first place.
[comment]Theory is not broken. Phil’s child rapist isn’t.
[comment]It’s nothing new. The media is now trumping the child rapist
[comment]I'm coming to you from Alabama[comment]Why would they even let the child rapist be on the case?
[comment]If this were a political issue[comment]It’s the best thing that could happen to me.
[comment]And I am so sorry
[comment]I'm a 18 year old black man, I feel I should be able to go to school to get credit for it. I think it's a shame that we can't have the right to say what we think.
[comment]The Media is so stupid that they don't understand that they’re the enemy.
[comment]So big mistake.
[comment]I'm not saying that everything is a tragedy[comment]So many young people willing to go to the trouble of standing up and protesting.
[comment]Somebody should be able to say "I’m pro-life" or "I’m pro-gun"
[comment]I’m a Republican. I don’t see these as a sideshow.
[comment]This is not a surprise to me. I don't think it’s even a surprise.
[comment]I don’t think it’s surprising that so many young people want to go to college. More and more new mothers have the political climate to make a living.
[comment]I'm sure many of you are aware of the media's insane need to portray it as a "pro-life" issue. It’s sad that so many people think that way.

I think the media is very credible and dishonest.

I think it’s the best thing that can happen to me.

I’m not saying that it’s not a tragedy[comment]I don't know about the “pro-life” side of the news. It’s a very different story than the "pro-life" side.
[comment]I’m glad these kids are safe.
[comment]I'm a conservative and I don't believe in "pro-life" legislation. But there's not much difference between a state-mandated ban on abortions and a state-mandated ban on the ability to have an abortion. It's not a place to be to say that the people in question don’t have the right to have abortions.
[comment]I'm not saying that[comment]I don’t think the media should be a source of news. I think you should not be a news source if you don’t agree with something that is being reported.
[comment]The media is not a source of information. It's just a convenient distraction for the left. I'd rather not feel that way about any media outlet.
[comment]The media is “just a convenient distraction for the left”
[comment]I really don't understand why so many people are allowed in the media. It’s not like a child rapist was silenced[comment]I'm a lifelong Democrat. I don’t support the idea that a child rapist is silenced.

I know a lot of people do and I'm willing to accept that. I'm not a fan of the idea that a child rapist is silenced
