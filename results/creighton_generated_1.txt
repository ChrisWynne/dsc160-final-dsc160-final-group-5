Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

The biggest question is how much of a impact this will have on the citizenry.

The great thing about the protests at Trump rallies is that they're really only about the protests. The fact that the protests have an impact on the political institutions that Republicans and Democrats are trying to control won't affect the political system. If you see a protest that's about the police and the judiciary it's a protest about government.

So what happens to the political system if the protests don't impact the political system? How does that affect the electoral votes? How does that affect the electoral votes?

I don't think the protests will have any permanent effect on the political system.

The protests will continue to be about people who are doing something wrong and the government is corrupt.

I don't think the protests will have any lasting impact on the political system.

[comment]I'm not sure if there's a problem with that[comment]How are they going to convince Americans to vote for Trump[comment]I'm going to go over this in a little bit. I'll explain it in a minute.

The reason these “fake news” are so popular and important is that they are being knocked down so I don't have any words.

In the United States[comment]What the fuck are they doing in this election?
[comment]That's the question.

One thing people have to be prepared for is that the next Trump administration will likely include some very radical and extreme positions on immigration.
[comment]The Republican Party is absolutely obsessed with the FBI case.
[comment]I really hope[comment]Maybe they want to get Trump elected and smear his legacy.
[comment]Trump is the one who needs to be impeached.

[comment]This is why it's so important to hold the FBI report in the dark only for the next two years.
[comment]Just because Trump is in office[comment]Well[comment]Well[comment]I am not a fan of the FBI report.
[comment]It's a great story and I think it's fair to say that a lot of people are getting a little bit of the sting.
[comment]I thought the FBI was a great tool for stopping the illegal immigrant flow but it's been cited by the DOJ as a "regular" crime. 

They don't need it so much.
[comment]What an idiot
[comment]I thought the FBI was a great tool for stopping the illegal immigrant flow but it's been cited by the DOJ as a "regular" crime.
[comment]Well[comment]How is this illegal immigrant supposed to know about the FBI's existence and not the Russians? 

This is why the FBI was cited by the Justice Department and why it is being investigated.

This is why they are being investigated by the Justice Department and why Mueller's investigation is being given much more attention.
[comment]They're the ones who need to be impeached.
[comment]This is why it's so important to hold the FBI report in the dark only for the next two years.
[comment]There's one more source that is going to be investigated by the Justice Department and the FBI.

[comment]They're called the law enforcement agencies.
[comment]It was great to see.
[comment]The Trump administration seems to really like Fox News. I feel like they're the ones who are saying: "We're going after the FBI for interfering in the election".
[comment]Well[comment]I just want to point out that the FBI is actually a different agency than the DOJ. They have some really bad things to say about Trump.  I don't like his actions and I don't approve of his politics.
[comment]I'm not particularly focused on the FBI because that's just what the FBI has

This is what happens when you put politics above law enforcement.
[comment]No way.

No way.

We have to be ready to vote for Trump and those going after the FBI.
[comment]Flynn is a hero. He should be investigated for the murder of a law enforcement officer.
[comment]This is going to be a major issue for Trump. He's going to need to get impeached for his failure to prosecute the FBI.
[comment]I have been hearing a lot of negative stories about the FBI being disbanded. What does this mean if the FBI is disbanded?
[comment]This will still happen
[comment]Very cool.
[comment]If we have a divided country[comment]This is great news. I'll vote for Trump. He won the popular vote in 2016 and he's been the GOP nominee for years now. So it's a must win. It's also good news that the FBI is disbanded.
[comment]Good
[comment]I agree with the sentiment that this is a big deal. It's about time the FBI was disbanded. Federal law enforcement is completely useless to the people who elected it.
[comment]This is great news. I'll vote for Trump. He won the popular vote in 2016 and he's been the GOP nominee for years now. So it's a must win. It's also good news that the FBI is disbanded.
[comment]I just felt the need to point out that we have the liberty to choose who keeps our guns and who doesn't. 

I know a lot of conservatives who think the FBI is a "bad" and that the "good" is the FBI.  I agree with that.
[comment]I agree that the FBI is a different animal. In my opinion[comment]I wan to see the FBI disappear. The FBI is a big deal to me.
[comment]This is great news. I'll vote for Trump. He won the popular vote in 2016 and he's been the GOP nominee for years now. So it's a must win. It's also great news that the FBI is disbanded.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
     

[comment]It's extremely important to note that there's no way to know for sure that a majority of people in the United States are not entirely trusting government[comment]I don't think the death of George Floyd is a surprise[comment]This is the kind of thing that could impact the voting bloc. If we need to interfere to change the outcome for Trump[comment]I thought the FBI's death was a surprise to the general public and to the general election.
[comment]As a Republican[comment]I will vote Stein[comment]What the fuck is going on?? 

The question is whether these things are somehow "correlated".

It's great that there are plenty of people on the right who see the FBI as a legitimate public safety threat. But it's also important to note that the FBI has never been known to be the most effective tool for police activism and suppression of peaceful protest. It's also important to note that the FBI is not a secret police force
The FBI has been acting as a number of agencies for many years[comment]&gt;

So what's the big deal?
[comment]I have a feeling that the FBI's death will have a huge impact on the general election. Although I'd vote for the former.
[comment]The FBI was a secret police force until the Nixon administration used it to suppress civil rights and civil liberties. It's also possible that the FBI's loss of credibility will weaken the GOP's chances of winning the election.
[comment]Sigh.
[comment]I think this will be a big blow to the Democrats. They destroyed the FBI[comment]I'm a Republican and I believe in the FBI's existence and will vote for Trump. But I also think that the FBI's loss will severely weaken the Trump presidency.
[comment]The FBI is going to be outclassed[comment]They both destroyed the FBI.
[comment]I think that this will be a big blow to the Democrats. They destroyed the FBI.
[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]I mean
I think this is a big blow to the Dems.
[comment]This is the kind of thing that could impact the general election.
[comment]I know it is[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]It's not the right thing to do
[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]The FBI has always been a secret force for peaceful protest.
[comment]I hope the Democrats figure out how to stop the FBI from being destroyed by Trump's legacy.
[comment]Good.  I hope the Democrats figure out how to stop the FBI from being destroyed by Trump's legacy.
[comment]The FBI is a secret police force and the President of the United States should be prosecuted for it.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
     

So far as I can tell

Also

I think the reality is that Trump supporters are really fucking tired of the shit that the “impeachment” has been going on for so long. The president is getting out of control.
[comment]This is why I don't vote for Trump.
[comment]Struggling to find the right words to describe this?

I'm not sure why
[comment]How can anyone not support him.
[comment]There has to be some real difference between Trump supporters and Democrats.

I think the best way to look at it is that
The president and the country have been screwed.
[comment]Biden and Biden are ON trial and we can't just sit there and watch this happen.
[comment]I've been saying for a while that there was no difference between Trump supporters and Democrats
[comment]The two parties are the same.
[comment]Don't get me wrong[comment]There's a lot of misinformation about Trump supporters and Republicans.
[comment]Yes
Towards the end of the debate

We can't be too careful.
[comment]This is why I don't support Trump.
[comment]Joe Biden is not a "good" man
[comment]Trump fans are out to get them.
[comment]The problem is[comment]Trump supporters have no right to the facts.
[comment]The "good" man
[comment]Lol
[comment]Then let's impeach him for this.
[comment]Right.
[comment]The problem is he's not a real president. He's an idiot who really doesn't believe the facts.
[comment]I think it would be good if the WH team investigated this and found that it was deliberate.
[comment]Wasn't it a campaign issue that the whole campaign was about?
[comment]I agree that the Trump administration is plagued by problems and issues that already exist. But[comment]I don't want to see it. The evidence is overwhelming that he's a hack.
[comment]Maybe this is some sort of legal theory.
[comment]Well
If it doesn't apply to you[comment]This is what happens when you have a conspiracy theorist. 

He threatens to prosecute the person who exposed it. 

He threatens to seize the campaign. 

He's got a vice presidential pick. 

He's got a cabinet. 

His campaign is shut down. 

The media is dead[comment]I am worried that the media will continue to stay on the air for the rest of the election. It will not matter how many investigations or investigations into the Trump administration come forward.
[comment]I don't think people who are Trump supporters[comment]How about you[comment]If they can't be impeached[comment]The problem is[comment]Trump fans aren't Republicans. They're Trump Democrats.
[comment]I think it's fair to say that Trump fans[comment]The problem is that the opposition party is going to continue to keep on going.
[comment]What's the difference between a Trump supporter and a Trump Democrat?
[comment]The difference is[comment]I don't think the debate was good. The evidence is overwhelming that he's a hack.
[comment]What is the difference between a Trump supporter and a Trump Democrat?

At this point[subtext]
[comment]I don't think it's going to be a landslide victory for Trump[comment]This is not historic. How can a Republican president win? The problem is that the right and the left are trying to paint Trump as an enemy of the state and a good guy who will do nothing to help the state.
[comment]Trump is a joke. He is truly a murderer.
[comment]I think he should have been indicted.
[comment]Not as much as I'd expect.
[comment]Hillary lost. 

They didnt pull it out and they didnt even try to impeach her.
[comment]I know she is a little bit of a trumpp[comment]Hillary is a nightmare[comment]I think it's true that the left and the right have learned a lot[comment]I guess we'll see.
[comment]Well[comment]I know it's just a few people. But I just don't get it.
[comment]Can you imagine if the right had been more organized?
[comment]The left is still girding for a Trump landslide. I'm not sure they can handle that.
[comment]I just don't understand it.
[comment]I'm not sure what they were trying to say when they said they would not impeach her.

[comment]I don't think this is a landslide. The right is in general quite comfortable with this. The left is downright uncomfortable with it.
[comment]I'm just a little concerned about the fact that this is just a Democratic landslide and Democrats are still in a very tight race.
[comment]Why is this in the news?
[comment]Well[comment]I just started my own subreddit. I'm trying to figure out what the needs of the left are. I'm also thinking of how to run a campaign.
[comment]I actually agree with the left on some things. I think most people aren't very familiar with what they are talking about.

[comment]The left's reaction to the Trump/FBI/Flynn/Flynn case is pretty bizarre. Don't let these people get away with it.
[comment]The left had a lot of ideas about what they were going to do with the president when he left. They are very fearful of the president.
[comment]I know that the left is a lot more organized. But I just don't get it.
[comment]I really don't understand the left. I actually think that the right isn't organized at all.
[comment]I think the left is just as nervous about the Trump/FBI/Flynn/Flynn case as the right.
[comment]The left just kept trying to make their case that the president was involved in the Trump/FBI/Flynn/Flynn murder. I think that's just the way it is.
[comment]I think the right is just stubbornly afraid of showing the truth.
[comment]The right is just hanging on with it.

[comment]Is there a timeline for when the FBI investigation will end?
[comment]I'd say the FBI investigation will end[comment]This is why I think the FBI investigation is going to end in a landslide. 

The FBI was an absolute disaster.
[comment]There is a chance the FBI will be disbanded[comment]Maybe they are already.
[comment]The FBI is the one that has been using trump/biden/whatever trump thing as a cover.
[comment]The FBI is the only one that can be prosecuted.
[comment]I was absolutely stunned and very confused when I read the headline.  I thought the headline was quite literally saying the FBI was a hoax.  I thought it was just a headline to be used as a reason to stop pursuing the FBI.  The FBI is so full of bullshit that it needs to be stopped.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
     I can't think of a single example where the power of police over citizens has been compromised. The only one that has been compromised is the FBI case.

As for the way police (and law enforcement agencies) are handling the Flynn/Flynn case[comment]No one has been criminally prosecuted[comment]The president should take this with a grain of salt because it is a public record that is being destroyed.
[comment]Trump and the FBI were convicted of the crime.
[comment]Why do so many people continue to believe this.
[comment]The FBI case is a miscarriage of justice.
[comment]The FBI case is a miscarriage of justice.

If the FBI or any other law enforcement agency acquits the officer behind the crime[comment]This is why the FBI is a disgrace.

Every time the president makes a statement[comment]It's a complete waste of time.
[comment]Ugh.

What is this about?
[comment]But the president and his team behind the scenes are the same ones behind the Hillary emails and the emails that the FBI never investigated.
[comment]The FBI is a disgrace.
[comment]The FBI case is a miscarriage of justice.
[comment]They must be removed from office or the whole nation will be in a state of absolute horror.
[comment]If only the president would have asked the FBI to investigate a crime that was under investigation himself.
[comment]The FBI is a complete failure.
[comment]Well the President must resign.
[comment]Why would the FBI investigate a crime that was under investigation themselves.
[comment]The FBI is a complete failure.
[comment]We can't have a constitutional republic without the FBI.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
      

What will remain of the republics are the partisan gerrymanders and the failure of the military to mobilize the general population.    

And the republican base will continue to see no moral or legal reason to continue the war in Yemen.

The republican base is no longer a part of the Democratic Party.

There are plenty of people who don't like the war in Yemen
There is a long history of the republican party having a very strong moral and legal position in the war.   

I think that in the coming decades we will see a very different party.

And that party will be more politicized than it was before the war. 

It's a growing party with more and more influence.

It's a party that believes in a different kind of government
And the republicans will continue to need to rely on the military for stability after the war.

They will continue to support what they see as the questionable morality of the war in Yemen.

And that party will continue to be very politicized.

And it will continue to be upended by the fact that the FBI case was not investigated by the Justice Department. 

And the Democrats will continue to be very politicized.

And the republican base is no longer under Democratic leadership.

It seems like Republicans have become very politicized. 

But it's pretty easy to see in the recent polls that the Democratic base is becoming more politicized.

So it's mostly a matter of time before Republicans are exposed as having become so politicized that they become very politicized.

The question then is
What long lasting consequences will come from this?

I think it's important to note that this is largely the same Republican party that was involved in the death of Michael Flynn.

Both parties have a long history of 'reform' of the military. 

You can see this in the GOP's failure to enact a constitutional amendment to overturn the Iraq War.

What the republican party did was not 'reform' the military. 

It's largely a matter of how the GOP loses the nomination.

The real question is
What will it take to be able to continue the war in Yemen when it goes into its final stages?

The FBI itself is a disaster for the United States.

If the FBI case in the Flynn case had been allowed to go ahead and be reported to the Justice Department and reported to the FCC[comment]Being the guy who wanted to keep the FBI in place in the midst of the Hillary Clinton email scandal[comment]It's been a disaster for the FBI's ability to investigate the Trump/Russia/Putin economy.

[comment]I know that many people are concerned about the FBI being a distraction in the election.

But[comment]Why is the FBI not a crime? 

I think it's because the president is terrified of the FBI.
[comment]#1. The FBI played a part in the hack of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI. 

#2. The FBI lost a major legal battle with the Obama Justice Department over the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation
#3. The FBI has been working with the Trump administration on the Flynn/Flynn investigations for the past 4 years.

#4. The FBI is a big deal to the Trump administration because it's a direct violation of the Republican Party's full faith and credit as a ally.
[comment]I'm a Democrat[comment]I'm a Democrat and these are just facts. The FBI has been working with the Republicans on the same issues.

"[T]he FBI is a crime.

Now it's time for the Justice Department to investigate the FBI.

It was the FBI that allowed the Trump administration to manufacture and distribute voter suppression equipment so as to ensure that the election was rigged.
[comment]The FBI is a crime.

But as it stands right now there is no meaningful way to assess the level of trust in the institutions of the current political system
   

I understand that the FBI case has been a divisive issue among republicans and conservatives.     
 
But they are not.

The FBI case has been a divisive issue among republicans and conservatives.    

Those who support the FBI case are not the right wing or the left wing.
   

So while the FBI case has been divisive and divisive the FBI case has gone to the extreme right.

In the end the FBI case has been the right wing's downfall.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

[comment]And there's no shit about the FBI case.   

But there's a lot of interesting things to note.

The Flynn/FBI investigation brought about a lot of new information about the Trump campaign and Russia

The Flynn/FBI investigation has been a big part of the anti-Trump protests
 The Trump administration has made it very clear that they do not believe in Russia

The Republicans and Democrats are the enemy and the Democrats are the enemy

The president is the enemy

The republican party is the enemy

The FBI case is the absolute worst example of how our country is going to go.

And given the bombastic nature of the administration and the media and the media outlets Bloomberg[comment]The FBI case is the worst example of how our country is going to go. 

The federal government[comment]I don't see any reason to bother with the FBI case. They have the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country and they have the most powerful intelligence community in the country.

They are the main focus because they have the most powerful law enforcement and intelligence community.

They have the most powerful intelligence community in the country

I ask because they have the most powerful intelligence community in the country.

[comment]I’m not the only one who’d like to think of these people as the enemy.

The same is true with the FBI and the Feds.

As I've said in the past

These people have a long way to go before we have a legitimate debate on the issues and the interests of the general public. However[comment]I'm a Democrat and I’m not a partisan.  I just think it's premature to say that people should solely vote their own way.

I'm a Republican and I’d rather vote my own way.
[comment]I’m not a partisan and my vote was for the FBI.
[comment]Many people are going to view the FBI as the enemy.
[comment]I’d like to think that it’s a good thing they are the enemy.
[comment]The FBI is a tool of the criminal syndicate that the United States of America has been in the first place.
[comment]I think the most damning part of this is that it’s in all its terrible glory.
[comment]It's a big thing.
[comment]I'd say that this is a warning to the general public. You’ll probably want to vote your own way.
[comment]Even if you don't vote your own way[comment]If we're going to talk about law enforcement[comment]They are a criminal syndicate.
[comment]It’s pretty clear that this will only go up.
[comment]I don't think I’d be surprised to see it.
[comment]This is why I'm voting for Democrats:

The Dem base is a scary quantity and is a threat to this country.
[comment]I think we should open everybody up to the possibility of being investigated for some type of crime.
[comment]I'm a Democrat and I’m not a partisan.  I just think it’s just propaganda.
[comment]These people have a long way to go before we have a legitimate debate on the issues and the interests of the general public. However[comment]We need to get on the campaign trail and make sure that no one is thinking we're making things worse.
[comment]I don't think it's a good idea to send a letter to the president saying that you will not be able to represent your state in the senate.
[comment]Trump has a long way to go before he can be trusted to lead America.
[comment]It's pretty clear that the FBI and Flynn are a criminal syndicate.
[comment]The FBI is a criminal syndicate.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

[comment]I think the sentiment is that the FBI case and the decision to not call a public inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Floyd was not compromised by the fact that the FBI knew the information would be released on the basis of a public inquiry and that there was no intent to cause harm to the FBI or the public.
[comment]What a difference a day makes.
[comment]I think it was a mistake to call the FBI an agency
The number[comment]It's not the FBI.

It's the political party.

I think there are some who feel that the bureau has simply left the door open to the investigation into the death of Floyd.
[comment]It's a shame that the FBI doesn't hold anything to be more than that.
[comment]I think the question is whether it will be an easy sell for Trump to increase the number of investigations into the deaths of a number of people.
[comment]I have a feeling that the majority of republicans who support the FBI in this election will agree with Trump on this issue. I have a feeling that some of them are more committed to the FBI than the Trump administration[comment]I think the FBI is an important tool in the Trump administration.

It is the FBI's crime to interfere with the Trump administration.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

The question then is how it will affect the way in which the federal government is run.

The FBI case has been a huge international story
The FBI has been in the same place for close to 20 years

They had been doing their jobs
They both had the same objectives
They both had the same concerns
They both had the same ethical standards
They both had the same policies
They both had the same black flags
They both had the same statements
Neither had the same concerns about the other.

I know that the FBI is a federal agency but it appears they both have similar objectives (and they both have similar goals). I also know that the FBI has the same objectives as the FBI.

But the FBI is a Federal entity and they both have the same objectives.

There are a lot of politicians who are very concerned about the FBI not doing their job. It's most likely that they will take the FBI to court for violating their oath of office or the Constitution.

Personally I think that the FBI is a federal entity and I think it's important that the FBI serves as the preeminent federal authorities.

I suspect that people on the left will see the FBI as an enemy of the United States and they will be very angry about it.
[comment]If they fail to act[comment]They both have the same objectives

[comment]If you're going to have a democracy you can't have a criminal-led police state.
[comment]This is the reason why I voted to go to the polls in 2016. It helps because I can vote for a Democrat and I can't for any other reason.

[comment]I've been following the election closely ever since. As I've gotten into the hack and the bot I've seen articles about the election. People are really worried about the implications of the FBI's finding.

I really am not a fascist. I think the best thing he could do for the country was to just be in office and not have any involvement with it.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
     

I do have to say that this is an interesting story. The Democratic Party is more or less in the lurch as a result of the FBI's handling of the Bill Clinton impeachment than it was in the 1960s. Its the same in both parties. But I've always felt that the Democratic Party has a lot easier time finding the right balance in these debates.
[comment]Well[comment]It's a far cry from the Watergate era.
[comment]I've been saying for a very long time that it's pretty clear that Obama and Biden deal a great deal with the Trump presidency. They deal with the Mueller investigation with a very high degree of certainty. They deal with the Justice Department's Mueller investigation with a very low degree of certainty. They deal with the FBI's Mueller investigation with a very low degree of certainty.
[comment]The fact that they continue to refuse to prosecute the Trump administration or the Trump presidency regardless of the outcome of the FBI's investigation is an embarrassment for the Democratic Party.

It's well deserved[comment]What happens to the integrity of the FBI in the wake of the FBI's investigation?
[comment]The republicans have been lying all along.  They have been lying all along. They have been lying all along.
[comment]I think it's safe to say that the FBI is going to go back to business normal next year.  And the US electorate is going to be more or less the same as the last two years.

I don't know how well it will be understood by the "progressive" voters. If they can't understand the situation in America (and the impact on the Democratic party) they can't understand the situation in the country.

There is a new generation of political sociopaths out there. They are hard to deal with. They are fundamentally different from the average person.

And their base won't see anything new. They won't see anything new.
[comment]There are many Americans who believe that if the FBI finds a single crime that won't be criminally prosecuted by the Justice Department that it is an impeachable offense. This is a partisan line of attack and the president is in complete complete denial mode.

Finally[comment]It should be noted that the FBI was not formally investigated. The new investigation will see this as the basis for the charges being laid and the charges being considered.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

Now the response of the Republican Party to the Flynn/Flynn case is pretty complicated. The Flynn/Flynn case has been a political disaster for Republicans. As Republicans have learned in their own party history[comment]I just have to say that I'm not surprised or surprised. The FBI case has been a great source of curiosity for me. As I've mentioned before it's not the first time the FBI has been a source of surprise. It's taken me a long time to figure out how the FBI works. It is a sociopathic machine.
[comment]I really don't think the FBI is a good fit for a team that has a reputation for its own sake. The actual FBI is a division of the FBI that is actively working for the greater good. In other words they are all part of the same enemy.
[comment]I was so confused by this news. I don't think I will ever vote for Trump. It's not going to be a landslide victory for Democrats. The only way to win is for the Democratic Party to pick up seats in the House.
[comment]I thought the FBI case was a political disaster for Trump. I even thought that was a good idea to have a link to the FBI before voting for him. He has a pretty good lead in the polls with the FBI.
[comment]If they do not resign and go to jail they will be arrested for treason. 

If any of the above is true

They are all criminal.

[comment]I don't know about you[comment]The FBI was a sub-discipline for the last 4[comment]This is what happens when you get to a crisis point and it will be investigated.
[comment]I even voted for Trump. I don't know anything about police work.
[comment]This isn't really news[comment]I think the most important thing is to not let the liberals use the FBI where it is needed.
[comment]Flynn is a great man but I think we will have to wait and see.
[comment]I would have voted for Nixon but it was a big mistake.
[comment]This is what happens when you get to a crisis point and it will be investigated.
[comment]Is this what happens when you get to a crisis point and it will be investigated.
[comment]I voted for Trump[comment]We can all agree that the FBI is an effective[comment]This is what happens when you get to a crisis point and it will be investigated.
[comment]I believe it has to be investigated. 

This is the problem.
[comment]The FBI is a sub-discipline for the last 4 years
[comment]The FBI was a sub-discipline for the last 4 years

I have no doubt that the Trump administration will investigate the FBI. The Trump administration is a disgrace
[comment]As someone who has been following the FBI for quite some time[comment]The FBI is a sub-discipline for the last 4 years

It's not a requirement. But it's a requirement. It is a requirement. It was a sub-discipline for 4 years. And

If Trump wins
Trump's policy of constantly firing people who don't follow his rules is the exact reason why he has been so successful.
[comment]We have to be careful not to use the FBI as an excuse to prosecute anyone for not following his rules.

The American people have been served well by the Trump administration and the president is right on all things Trump.
[comment]And[comment]Yes[comment]Trump's next move is to turn his attention to the Ukraine crisis which will lead to Trump impeachment and a re-run of the US presidency which will likely result in the death of the most important figure in American history[comment]Should be a very interesting election.
[comment]Does the FBI have any role in this?
[comment]It's hard to see how it [comment]If he loses he'll be impeached. That's what he's done.
[comment]Does anyone know if there is any way to get the FBI to turn over all the emails to the Senate and the White House?
[comment]Is there any chance the FBI will hand over all that emails to the senate if Trump wins?
[comment]Trump and the Russians are leading the impeachment.
[comment]Maybe it's time to get a new prosecutor who is more legislative and more effective
I don't think the FBI is the only reason Trump lost.
[comment]I don't think it's the FBI that should be investigating Trump.

The FBI isn't the problem.
[comment]Maybe it's time to put a stop to this now?
[comment]I think it's too bad that this election cycle Trump has a lot to answer for. He's not very popular among Democrats. Consider this:

1. We now have two unelected branches of government

2. Trump's administration has grown longer and has been more corrupt

3. The FBI is an FBI

4. The president has overplayed his hand with the Russia investigation

5. Trump is the most corrupt President since Richard Nixon

6. The president ran a criminal operation to destroy the Clinton email server

7. The FBI has a reputation as corrupt and has been very effective

8. The FBI has a reputation for being partisan.

I think it's safe to say that the FBI is an FBI.

I also think it's safe to say that it's not just the FBI that has an FBI problem.

I think it's safe to say that the FBI is an FBI.

I really suspect that Trump and the Russians are behind the FBI.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
     

Given the way the Trump administration is doing things in the wake of this investigation
The media is more or less complicit in the murder of this person. This is a direct result of the FBI case. 

This should be a wakeup call for all of us. 

The Democrats and Trump supporters aren't the only ones that have been complicit. 

The FBI case is just one of many examples that the media treats as if it is the FBI case or nothing.

I'm posting this because I'm still not convinced that the media are too cowardly to do their job. 

I do believe that the media should shut down the coronavirus response if this case is going to affect the electoral vote.  

I also believe that if the Trump/GOP administration refuses to back down on the investigation then the investigations of the Trump/GOP administration will continue.  

Also
The FBI case is just one example that the media treats as if it is the FBI case or nothing. 

The FBI case is just one example of the media's indifference on this issue.

The way the media treat the FBI case is just two facts that the media ignores.

1) 

The FBI case indicates that the FBI is essentially a foreign intelligence agency.

2) 
 

The FBI case also indicates that the FBI is a law enforcement agency.

I think they're both based on human error.

I also think that the FBI case is just one example of the media's inability to investigate the fact that the Clinton and Obama administrations have been actively interfering in the US political process.

Of course

The FBI case also indicates that the FBI is a federal agency

I feel like the FBI case is the most damning example of the media's inability to take the lead on this issue.

I really hope the post-Flynn and Mueller case outcomes continue to be politicized and that they result in the death of the president in the general election. 


I guess I can see the end of this as little as $1.5 million dollars from the Feds.
[comment]&gt; Give George a huge thank you and follow his example. 

&gt;

I don't think there is any middle ground in this.
[comment]No[comment]I hope he is pretty much dead by the time the Trump administration/Ascension is over.
[comment]This is going to come as a huge shock to many people. The fact that the FBI's death was so sudden and in such a sudden fashion does not bode well for the Trump administration. Hopefully the president will move quickly and allow the FBI to go down in history as one of the greatest law enforcement agencies of all time.
[comment]This is obviously going to come as a huge shock to law enforcement. I don't think there is any middle ground.
[comment]I have a feeling the arguments in the Trump administration would be about the constitution itself.
[comment]I think it's more of a political statement than anything else.
[comment]I just hope he gets the best of treatment.
[comment]This is going to come as a bit of a relief to many people. Police are still powerful and can be trusted.
[comment]I'm not sure how much of an impact the Trump administration/Ascension will have on the FBI.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

The point here is this:

A new generation of law enforcement is coming of age — and that generation will be found in the wake of the death of the President and the resignation of the FBI Chief.

The news that the former police chief of the FBI has been convicted of a treasonous crime is a powerful reminder that the FBI and its Republican allies have very little in common with the President and the Democratic Party.

We can't have it both ways.

[comment]I believe it's important to understand that the FBI has a long history of dealing with far right political groups. This has nothing to do with the FBI being associated with the Sanders side or the FBI being associated with the Trump side. These groups are not a contest between the FBI and the Trump administration.
[comment]I have a feeling that the FBI is going to lose the election in November. The President has already called the FBI to concede and the FBI still has a long way to go.
[comment]I think this is the right thing to do as the FBI appears to have no choice but to concede.
[comment]Well[comment]It's getting a lot closer to Election Day.    

What we have in the polls is a Republican Party that is more pro-coronavirus than the Republican Party.

The GOP has been pushing the coronavirus response strategy for some time
A lot of conservatives are going to vote for Bill Clinton or Joe Biden - and they'll all be against the coronavirus response...
[comment]Maybe I'm biased but I think this is the right thing to do.
[comment]Biden is a very progressive[comment]Just because you can't win the popular vote doesn't mean it's going to happen
The only way to win the popular vote is to win the election.
[comment]
Well Biden is out of the race but if he is a viable candidate[comment]It's pretty much assuredly going to be a landslide for the Democrats.

The Republicans have the largest advantage in the Electoral College and that's what it will take to retake the House and Senate.
[comment]It's just the beginning.
[comment]So this is how it should be.
[comment]So it is.   

But it is the only way we can retake the Senate and the White House.
[comment]I hope this is not a surprise. I think it's the right thing to do[comment]It's a sure bet that Trump will lose the popular vote either way.
[comment]Oh[comment][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKzhn1K2yEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKzhn1K2yEs)
[comment]I don't like the fact that this is a coronavirus pandemic.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

As I have argued in the past[comment]I can't believe people still believe this.

The current narrative is a continuation of the McCarthyism that was the GOP's prerogative in the '60s. It's in the context of the Iran hostage crisis[comment]We Demands Trump Suspend All Of The Firing Of His Interim Chief And Prosecute The Interim Chief And Prosecute The President
   

And then there's the people who want the president arrested and convicted.

Then there's the people who want the president killed.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

[comment]The basic arguments for the FBI/Flynn case are that the FBI had compelling government interests in mind so they can't be found in a way that would lead to the FBI finding any relevant evidence. This argument fails on a number of levels. First of all[comment]There's no such thing as "good" evidence.  The FBI is a tool of the government.  Therefore they can't be found. 

The FBI is incapable of finding any evidence positive of a specific law enforcement activity. 
  

Then there's also the fact that the FBI is a private intelligence service.  Therefore they can't be found to be useful in any way.


The FBI is a special investigative agency that has been funded by the government for decades.  The FBI is the enemy of the people and indeed of the country.
 

Flynn is a plain-clothed American.  And his killing is nothing new.  If he had been in the right[comment]There's a difference between "good" evidence and "bad" evidence.
[comment]The FBI is an interesting development. But this is the first time in modern history that a president has taken the lead and created something that is quite obviously not there.
[comment]Is there a problem with the FBI?
[comment]There is not a problem.
[comment]This is why this is so important.
[comment]It's quite possible that some of the candidates will follow the FBI's lead and create a new one. For example[comment]The FBI has been on the hunt for the Trump campaign for months now. This is a good time to look at some of their work in the context of a general election.
[comment]The FBI's work is often under-resourced. They are tied up with the FBI's counterintelligence division[comment]This is a good time to start thinking about how we can use the FBI's work to help elect a president who will make matters worse for all Americans[comment]The FBI has been unable to find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts (and has not been able to get any.
[comment]The FBI has been an effective tool for the Trump campaign[comment]I think the most important thing is that the FBI has been able to run its own counterintelligence budgets and be able to search through them to try to find any information that might be useful.
[comment]I think maybe it's useful to have the FBI do other things to try and get more evidence of collusion.
[comment]To be fair[comment]I don't think the FBI is able to use its counterintelligence budget to search through voter data to see whether it's on the right side of things.
[comment]I think it's useful to have the FBI do other things to try and get more evidence of collusion.
[comment]The FBI and the Justice Department both have their own counterintelligence division.

[comment]I can't believe it's been 50 years!
[comment]I mean[comment]This is scary. This is what democracy looks like.
[comment]I don't think Trump is the only one who has been brainwashed to believe in the FBI.
[comment]I recently listened to a podcast about the FBI and the Trump administration with my dad who was a young man who was a reporter for the local NBC station in the midwest. He said that the FBI had been working on the Flynn failure and had warned him.                              

He said that the FBI has been working on the Flynn failure since the Trump administration started.  He also said that the FBI has been working on the Flynn failure since the Trump administration began. 

The people on the left and the right have been saying for years that the FBI has been working on the Flynn failure since the Trump administration started. 

In fact[comment]I think it’s too soon to say whether the FBI is 100% legal or not.
[comment]I don't understand why it doesn't matter.

The best thing that can be done is to start new investigations with the FBI.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

The FBI case reminds me of the courts case regarding the death of Nelson Besser in the 1970s.   

The courts case was about the FBI's handling of the Nixon impeachment proceeding.  

The FBI case involved the death of a high ranking FBI official. 

The FBI case involved the appointment of George L. Flynn as FBI director in the early 1990s. 

The FBI case involved the FBI's handling of the Watergate scandal. 

The FBI case involved the FBI's handling of the Michael Flynn impeachment inquiry. 

The FBI case involved the killing of a prominent former FBI officer. 

These are just a few of the significant impacts on the political and legal environment that the FBI case has had on the political and legal environment.

[comment]I've been doing this on r/politics for a year now and I can say with certainty that the FBI case is extremely significant and will have a large impact on the Democratic Party.
[comment]A lot of this was done to ensure that the president and his allies could not be prosecuted for their crimes.

It also hurt Hillary Clinton.

[comment]This is a fact.

[comment]Flynn is a traitor to America and is the direct result of the Obama administration.

[comment]I would have thought it would be obvious from the Nixon administration
[comment]I don't know why it was that way and I don't think it was the right time to do it.
[comment]Maybe the FBI is being investigated for the crimes that they committed.

[comment]This is the time to stop arguing about how the media is biased.
[comment]Do you guys think they are being investigated for the crimes that they committed?
[comment]It's not the first time the FBI has been investigated for the crimes that they committed.
[comment]This is why I have been actively pushing for the FBI to investigate Trump and the Republican party. All of these things have been shown to be politically motivated.
[comment]They should be investigated and found to be relevant to this case.

[comment]I just wanna say that I have immense respect for the FBI. They should be investigated for the crimes that they committed.
[comment]I think it's a good idea to unite the judiciary and the police. The police has been prosecuted before and the judiciary has been prosecuted. The police should have the power to investigate and convict the president.

[comment]So what are all the implications for the criminal justice system?
[comment]Every case that was investigated in the Obama administration is a death.
[comment]I think this is the beginning of the end for the FBI.
[comment]This could have a very significant impact on the political ramifications.

Because he was acting on his personal beliefs.

[comment]This article is going to get a lot of attention
[comment]Why did he shoot him?
[comment]Now that he's president[comment]I think it's possible that the president reacted to this as a political issue. 

Trump was right.  It is likely that many people will be outraged about the FBI's decision to issue a presidential pardon for Flynn.  The president may not care about what the president says.
[comment]I still believe that it's the president that is the problem.  Trump was right[comment]Still[comment]This is going to be a very interesting and long term political backlash[comment]Why did he do that? 

Maybe he's trying to make a political point

[comment]The FBI has been doing a lot of extensive investigation[comment]I wonder how many people were banned from voting for the president as a result.
[comment]I wonder how many people were killed in the 2016 election.

[comment]It's a coincidence that the president is making these kinds of headlines.
[comment]This could very well be the beginning of the end for the FBI.

I find it hilarious that he's so petty and erratic like this.

[comment]I think it's fine with the FBI to investigate and prosecute the president for the obstruction of justice and criminal acts[comment]I just hope the president doesn't get any attention for the fact that he was part of the cover up.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)

The Real Reason Why the FBI Collapsed:

Republicans
   

The FBI's failure to protect Americans and its failure to protect Americans was
contrary to popular opinion

As you can tell by the response of the police and government to the Flynn/Flynn story[subtext]

Democrats[comment]This is the biggest failure of any administration in recent memory.

How will these mistakes be 'fixed' and how will the country deal with it?
[comment]If only more people knew that the FBI was there and the Flynn/Flynn debacle was isolated[comment]Trump's presidency continues to be an absolute disgrace.
[comment]How can anyone think it would be better to not be president?
[comment]This is the greatest failure of modern times.
[comment]It's sad that we have to wait more than a year for the system to adapt to Trump's presidency.
[comment]Well if only Hillary and the democrats had the courage to admit that the FBI had been compromised.
[comment]It was an FBI case[comment]They should be investigated because they were. The FBI worked overtime and handled the case in good faith and nothing was wrong.
[comment]For the record[comment]I think Trump and the Republican party need to be investigated. Maybe then we can have a president that is not only not only not only not only not only not only not only not even worse.
[comment]I would be extremely surprised if the FBI's failure as well as the Trump administration's failure is the major reason for the current electoral loss in November.
[comment]I would say that the failure of the FBI is the biggest reason for the election in 2016.

[comment]I can understand the argument why the FBI is not doing anything about the Trump campaign's response to the Flynn/Flynn fiasco. However[comment]The failure of the FBI is the biggest reason why the current electoral loss in November.
[comment]Who knows? Maybe that's because it was not a Trump administration case.
[comment]This is a Trump administration[comment]I think it's important to take a week to kind of understand the difference.
[comment]Well they got their answer after all.
[comment]Of course[comment]They can't be investigated.
[comment]Oh. Right. For all we know.
[comment]This is the first time in the history of the republic that the FBI has been investigated.
[comment]How can any of us expect anything less than the FBI to be investigated and then not be investigated?

[comment]This was the FBI case before it was a Trump administration.
[comment]Do not be surprised if this is the case again.
[comment]I am not in part in favor of investigations[comment]I thought the FBI was the biggest reason Trump lost the election. They probably knew that work was going to be harder for them.

And now the FBI is the biggest reason he lost.
[comment]The FBI was a big reason he lost.

They have no right to be asking for a criminal investigation.

They are the same party that allowed Putin to get away with the murder of a US ambassador.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

[subtext]
It seems like a unique news cycle over the past 30 days in the sense that police (federal and local) have lost a lot of trust from American voters on the right and the left. Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd. Even people on the right that I know say that the officer who killed George Floyd was clearly in the wrong.

The question then I have is: what long term impacts will this have on the political legitimacy of law enforcement in the United States? What impacts, on both sides, will this have on the electorate? (Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

I think the biggest and most obvious impact on the political legitimacy of law enforcement is whether such a move is constitutional. I believe early on that won't happen.

The thing is though that it's not like a crime has happened in the republic. It's just that the criminal has taken a different view on the matter.
[comment]This isn't about the FBI case[comment]Fuck this
[comment]I'm not saying that Trump or the FBI are bad people. I honestly doubt it's anything but a Trump purge of leading FBI agents.
[comment]I think it's the same with the Russia story. The Trump administration has played right into the hands of the Russia story and has tried to play down the fact that it's a conspiracy theory.
[comment]This is why I think it's a good thing to have the FBI as a part of the FBI as well. It's important to me that the FBI is in the news as well. I'd like to see it more in the news and the news cycle.
[comment]I think this is a good thing. That's why I think it's a good thing to have the FBI as a part of the FBI as well.

[comment]I suspect that then the president and the administration will be more cautious about it.
[comment]I'm not sure why[comment]I think the FBI case has the potential to have a negative impact on policing in the United States.
[comment]I think it's important to note that there is no current or former FBI Director who has ever been criminally prosecuted for a crime.
[comment]I think this is the time to ask the president to discredit the FBI and get on the FBI team.
[comment]I think we need to get a little more specific and say that it doesn't look like the president is taking a swing at the FBI.
[comment]I think it's important to ask the president to do something about this.
[comment]Oh[comment]I think it's important to ask the president to get on the FBI team.

Right now it seems like the FBI is the enemy.
[comment]I think the time to take these things seriously is now.

Will the death of George Floyd and the Flynn/FBI case delegitimize law enforcement for the majority of American voters?

Most right leaning folks I know were outraged about the FBI case on Flynn, and left leaning folks I know are even more outraged by the killing of George Floyd.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

As for the FBI case: it seems to have gotten the blessing of the Justice Department in the case of Floyd.

I think the principal question is whether there are any legal consequences to the matter or whether there are any challenges to the validity or validity of the indictment.

The Justice Department has an important role to play in this as it is the only federal agency that is legally bound to investigate and prosecute the corruption of the Trump administration and Russian interference.

The question then becomes how long will it be before the FBI case is read into law and the Trump presidency is essentially dead?

[comment]I hope so[comment]It's been a while since I've read a story about such an unnecessary and highly charged matter.
[comment]The FBI case is still going to be read into law. It's just not being read into law.
[comment]You'd think that once the new law is passed[comment]From what I can gather[comment]I have a feeling that this is going to be a very interesting case and I want to hope it's not just about the Trump administration.
[comment]This is exactly the kind of thing that should be DOJ and DOJ and DOJ/DOJ making a big splash.
[comment]The right has been making a lot of noise about the FBI's failure during the Trump administration. They went to great lengths to sabotage the FBI and partisan Democrats in order to maximize their own political gain. We should expect some of that to change soon[comment]This case is going to be a long one. I hope there's at least a couple of more court defeats.
[comment]It's important to note that while the FBI was not criminally liable for the Trump administration[comment]It is a case about the Trump administration and what they did to the Democratic Party. This case is about the FBI and the Democratic Party.
[comment]The FBI's failure in this case is absolutely not an isolated case. It's a clear case of the FBI not being impartial.
[comment]I can't wait to see what new evidence we find during the trial. The FBI's case will be interesting to see.
[comment]I'm not the smartest person to read this.
[comment]I never thought I'd read what they have to say.
[comment]I wonder what the Justice Department will do with the case?
[comment]I'm not a lawyer. I'm a Bloomberg exec.
[comment]There is something very interesting about this case.
[comment]The FBI is a very powerful and well-connected government. It's one of the most powerful agencies in the world.  It has a wealth of information and it can prosecute an entire political party.  It basically ran the country as a democracy.  And that's exactly what they did.
[comment]No[comment]This is good. I'm just not a fan of the FBI.
[comment]I'm loving the FBI.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

I think it's safe to say that the consequences of not voting in 2016 (or 2016-2020) will be felt by the majority of Americans in the near term.

And then there's the matter of the Trump administration. Trump's real goal is to remove Trump from office. This could be devastating for Democrats in 2016.

Even if the GOP can't make it to the president's desk it will be a huge blow to the Democratic base.

The Russians are a big reason this has happened.

If I was president I would have bought into the idea that the FBI was a coverup in the first place. But what I really missed is how far the FBI has gone to make that argument.

The FBI has literally destroyed the republic on several levels.

First, the FBI is a corporate entity and has no legal authority to be a public effective agency.

Second, the FBI is the primary lobby for the Trump administration.

The FBI is a major "corporate" enterprise.

The FBI is the middle man between the Trump administration and the working class in a way that the working class has never been.

The FBI is an "intelligence" arm of the Trump administration.

The FBI is a significant part of the Trump administration.

This is the same FBI that was the focus of the Trump administration.

The FBI is the primary federal government "intelligence" arm of the Trump administration.

[comment]This is not a debate about whether or not it will be good for the country or bad on both sides. It's about whether or not it will be good for the FBI.

We have to be careful of this. We have to be careful of this.

We have to be careful of this.

But to win[comment]I am pretty sure a majority of the electorate are not really into the investigation being done by the FBI.
[comment]I suspect it is a good thing because people are being treated roughly and the FBI is not under investigation.
[comment]I don't see the need for the FBI to be investigated. The law enforcement community is fighting a losing battle[comment]https://www.politico.com/2020/2/02/coronavirus-proceeding-police-criminal-charges-139905/[comment]The FBI has been investigated for years for the the fact that it refuses to release its report on the Flynn/Flynn scandal. It goes to court for the failure of the FBI to prevent murder and other crimes.
[comment]And the Democrats have no respect for the FBI. They have been accused of not doing enough to protect the First Amendment rights of the FBI.

But the FBI is a non-issue in this case.
[comment]A good number of Democrats are especially critical of the FBI for not working to protect the First Amendment rights of the FBI.

(Note, not just the 2020 election, but longer term tectonic shifts with the republican and democratic bases.)
    

This is obviously not going to happen.

But I think the right and left are going to be very concerned about the death of this officer.   

I think it is going to get a lot of media attention but it's going to be an extremely hard sell to most.
  

Also[subtext]I was hoping the news would be more focused on the matter of the president and the FBI case.  

I think they need to ask themselves: what are the chances of the FBI being criminally charged?  

It could be that the president is acting in self-defense but I don't think it's that likely. 

As I understand it[subtext]Trump’s supporters are just as outraged by the FBI case as anyone else. It’s going to be a very busy time for the president.  He is going to be in jail for the first time in the history of American history.
[subtext]I think this will have a very negative impact on the electoral vote.
[subtext]If you read the paper[subtext]If Trump loses he will be investigated for his actions as a president[Subtext]I hope the FBI case will be shut down for the good of the country. A lot of the evidence is still out there to be destroyed. The FBI were not the first and they will not be the last.  

The FBI is a non-profit and needs to be abolished. 

The FBI should be disbanded. 

We need to do more to protect the innocent and to ensure that the FBI is not used to finding anything new. 

The FBI has over the years been used to killing unarmed black men.

The FBI is useful for the FBI not the FBI.

I'm not so sure the FBI is the FBI.  I know they are.  I have to hope that this is the end of it.
[subtext]When you have the FBI in a bad place it is hard to see how it can be reformed. The FBI is not reformed.  It is a tool to the enemy and will continue to be used to this day.
