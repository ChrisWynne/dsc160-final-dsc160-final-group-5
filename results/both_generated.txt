We do not care about credit, just getting the message out there, so feel free to distribute however way you want, or make better versions yourself if you think it can be improved! We do not want America to be divided to the point where it is in a great moment of total conflict. We do not want to divide people based on race. We do want law enforcement to not only do their job but also treat everyone equally. We do not want criminals to hurt innocent people. We do not want police to look the other way when they are bad people. We do not want police to be bad. We are not trying to subvert the Constitution, but we do want society to accept the fact that we are all one. We are not trying to subvert the civil liberties currently held by the US government, but we do want people to be treated fairly. We do not want any people making a joke about being black. We are not trying to subvert the civil liberties held by the US government, but we do want people to be treated fairly. We do not want any government running people over for a traffic violation. We do not want any law enforcement officers running people over for a traffic violation. We do not want any police officers making racist or otherwise derogatory comments on social media. We simply do not want these types of institutions to be stifled. We do not want police officers being told to do their job, but we do want people to be treated fairly. This is not a new issue. We have had protests, riots, and shootings from the start. 

It started with the police killing a mentally ill black man in September. 

But the problem has gotten bigger. 

For one thing, the protests have grown and gotten a lot bigger. 

And there has been bad police training of black men. 

(Of course cops can't be trained to do that. 

They can just be trained. 

They can do some of the stuff we see police do every day.

But some of the stuff police do is actually frighteningly bad. 

That's what

Got a question for Taylor? Feel free to reach out, or just sit back and enjoy the moment. Thanks for calling it out. An officer needs to be held accountable if he or she is to not do their job. 

[Thanks for the time]

Police violence is a bad thing and it is not the fault of the police. 

It is the fault of the police for not doing their job. 

Buffalo is no different with the cop who killed Andrew Johnson. 

Just a thought.

Police officers don't only kill people, they also cause problems for law enforcement at every level. If this were not the case where a cop was involved, then there would be nothing for us to do about it.

We are never going to be a police state if a police officer kills someone. I think what this is about is that you don't take put and risk at this point. Not when you have been through multiple cops making bad decisions. I'm sorry, but that's not how it works in a civilized society. If we have any small hands, we'll do our best to maneuver and take the best risks up front.

But if we have no hands, we'll take the best risks in the world. 

You are either standing here with your hands up that no one will ever see you standing up, or you are sitting in your car and someone hits you with a brick or something. I'm incredibly sad and confused because your response sounds really good. I guess this is where the government will take the blame?

Police hurt more people than a terrorist who is actually killed by a cop. Trump is not our President, we are the President of the United States. 

I'm with democrats in this. 

You can be mad about violence at work and feel good about what you are doing when someone is injured. Maybe you should do something about the

For those of you who have never heard or read NASB, our new leader, is named after the house he is in. He is a former police union official, known for his strong stance on racial and gender differences, which shows he is not afraid to declare martial law. Seems like a good idea, especially to those of us in the know, but if you don't believe in martial law, then go right ahead and show someone else what you think is right.

This is a good start. I think we can do better. Back in the days of the military from the start it was a democracy, but there were times when it was a dictatorship. This time, it is police brutality (civilian) and that's for sure. The fucking flag is there in a nutshell. It's a symbol for the racism and sexism in the US. The point I'm trying to make is that you can't just label this as the riots and rioting and riots as time goes on. The truth is that many things matter. We are a divided country, people can't say all that much without sounding like a nut. I think that for a lot of the people out there, the message is the same. The protests need to get out there and say syria is america and fuck off country. I don't think that people, especially those protesting the military, think that the only way to get them out of this mess is to use pepper spray and tear gas. People fucking canâ€™t do that. Because thats how the military operate. They only use them for the protection of the soldiers and not for the protection of the police. So yes, the electoral college matters. Here's a statement some of the people I know who aren't affiliated with any of the above parties that you just came across: I want to say thank you to all of the people that voted for Trump. They're voting for something bigger than Trump, they're voting for something more

Edit: I think the person did a pretty good job of presenting the point that the article here was not focusing on the president at all. He didn't do that.

Edit: I would add that the article does show some of the protesters not giving a shit. I don't know why their point was not aired as they have a vocal group that clearly didn't. The reason I don't think that the article was ever mentioned is because of the tone of the article rather than important points of the situation at large. You don't need to say that the "protestors" are terrorists. You don't need to say that rioters don't care about justice, they just want their rights back, and they don't care if it's the police ordering them out of jail.

We will not be waiting for the trump administration to put an end to the impunity and abuse of power in US police. The words "respectful law enforcement" and the blue badge that everyone is wearing are not any good. The only thing that can stop police brutality is peaceful protests. Cops have been dealing with this for decades. The only thing that can stop it from happening to white people or the poor is peaceful protests. Simple as that. But you know what else? We all are entitled to our rights, and you can protest peacefully, but you can't peacefully protest because you're white. This is pretty simple. All cops are equal. But white cops are not equal. 

And white people just as much as white people are. And white people are not equal. They are just dirt rich white people. It's working out pretty well. White people of color have the most to lose, and white people of color have the worst. That's why we are calling for a full social and political dialogue, not just an airtight red line. 

We need to have dialogue. Let's not gush about how great people are. Let's not gush about how horrible they are. Let's not gush about how stupid they are.... And they are not dumb. 

Our lives are pretty good. The greatest thing has happened to us in the last 25 years is that we've all gotten irrelevant and irrelevant.

That's the point. What policies and language do you oppose or support? 

You can form your own opinion on the matter, but you can't make your own judgement about whether it's right or wrong. 

The best way to get things done is to start a dialogue, not to push the line. Your response is not meant to be implying that everyone is entitled to their rights, but that we all need to start talking about what we can do to address the systemic oppression of
