We do not care about credit, just getting the message out there, so feel free to distribute however way you want, or make better versions yourself if you think it can be improved! I understand what you mean. I'm still fluctuating, and any results to come will most certainly be in terms of police brutality. I'm also not thrilled about the excessive use of deadly force, which I believe is the primary reason police are getting into the area. At this point, I don't know how hard the hard knocks are on the Obama administration and his administration, and I don't know if the protests will last long enough to countenance the president's intentions, given the nature of his policies. But if the protests turn violent, I believe the police will resort to excessive force, especially during the most critical moments of the protest. If the riot goes unheeded, the military will, and will fatally shoot and throw grenades, including to disperse the crowd, leading to the concept that civilians are deliberately being hurt or killed. \n",

      "With that said, I remain extremely hopeful that the riots will end with the Police Department holding them accountable (and hopefully, Garner and Colvin accountable) to their own words rather than internal police orders. That said, I still believe that the protests are a primary source of threat to the status quo, and that the police brutality and abuse of authority are a primary cause of myriad of these riots. \n",

The you're fired, you got an internal affairs conviction on your record, no conviction for anything, no matter what. Some protestors even called for Trump to resign. What they're protesting isn't what he or Trump should have done, it's reactive and often unintended behavior. It displays a lack of understanding of how the world works and how to best use their frustrations with him or her.\n",

Let's get it!  The police are the ones abusing the powers of the police.  The people are abusing the powers of the state to abuse the powers of the state.  The people are abusing the powers of the state to abuse the state.  The elites are doing this, and it goes against everything we believe in for them. Yes, the police are horrible, but they are the ones doing it. Yes, the DNC and other DNC lists are full of defenseless civilians being murdered by the state, while the president is trying to use the military to your advantage. Yes, there are protestors to be arrested for, but there are none holding up police brutality as a hero.

I think they see this as support for what you're saying and treat it with respect. So far, so good. Now what? Biden has disbanded the Biden Family???? ? Ties That Bind? What about the One Percenters? People Who Just Want to Own The Banks? There are millions of us who do not share those views. The vast majority are very rich and powerful, well off in most years, and well off in recent years.

That's a very small minority that can make a big impression on the rest of the world. Great leader? Yeah okay. Maybe look into being a little more humble about your role.

I understand sentimentally, I don't. I'm not  a criminal justice system expert, but if you could give us an example of an example you feel is most clearly being used by the protestors, would you give it a tryst if called upon to do so? Anything that would make you think twice before doing so, especially since you clearly do not understand the point of protesting. Instead, you resort to violence, selfish rage bing, buzzwords like \"terrorist\", and so on. That's selfish, stupid, and often violent. That's violent, vicious, and unhinged. That's unhinged. That's destructive. That's sad. But also normal. I don’t know of a single one of those millions. It's a small minority that can be excused perhaps for being religious, but a minority that can be excused perhaps for being human rights defenders. A minority that can be excused perhaps for being whistle blowers, coders, and so on. There is a word for that: civil war. It is literally in the bible. I would argue that most of its works are in the Bible, and most are in the Bible uncritically. We’re not even sure what order would come to card a fight, given how many countries have republican parties, and how many have republican parties only in the past. To argue that the US has fascist governments, that the UK has republican governments, is to spread hate all over the place. It is not a new problem. In our history, governments have used populism to attack ordinary people and to goose the cry for war.\n",
