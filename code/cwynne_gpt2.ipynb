I have an older brother who is still angry that his dad had to go through the same amount of effort as FDR in getting elected.  He's a good man, and I'm glad that he's not acting like an asshole every day.

These people need to be put to sleep and their minds put to rest. Get in touch with your elected representatives and see if they will support policing and police reform in America. We need a landslide government victory in November, and it has to be in the hands of the people. If not, we may never have any representatives from our own people anymore. We need people who will represent the vast majority of Americans, not just fringe fringe Trump followers. This is ONLY a November election, and it will never happen in November. I think it’s clearly Biden's fault for not getting the nomination outright, but it’s his own fault. It’s always been weird when someone doesn’t even try to put themselves in the top 5.
