If you walk outside they will tell you he is not. If they finally say there are no POC there will be no looting. Exactly. I agree. If they tell you the same thing they are not protesting. I thought the same thing happened to the Houston cops. It is happening in every city. And they are not protesting anything. They just want justice. Oh wait, yeah, but completely different.

I didn’t see the officers doing the same thing when they fired on unarmed black men. I saw them putting their hands behind their backs and shooting someone. I saw them beating them with their hands on their heads. I saw them handcuffing and suffocating them. I can’t say I agree, but I do see the loss of life as being a societal issue. There is a problem with this system that needs to be addressed, and we need to work to address that issue. You don't see a problem with police brutality when you see a police system that is systematically misusing the power of the state. Well, I don't know what motivates me, but the sentiment is that we are not united, we are divided, we are divided. That sentiment is true no matter the party.
